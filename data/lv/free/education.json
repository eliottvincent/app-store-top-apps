From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

      "label": "The Arduino Science Journal (formerly Science Journal, an initiative by Google) is free and allows you to gather data about the world around you by harnessing the sensors in your smartphone as well as sensors connected to Arduino. The Science Journal transforms smartphones and tablets into science notebooks that encourage students to explore their world.\n\nThe Arduino Science Journal app is recommended for students from 10 to 18 years of age.\n\nAbout Arduino Science Journal\nWith the Arduino Science Journal, you can learn interactively, conduct experiments and iterate on findings.\n\n•  Enhance your existing lesson plans: use the Science Journal with activities and assignments you have already prepared\n•  Classroom & home-school friendly: you don’t have to be in a classroom setting to start exploring. The Arduino Science Journal can be used to run experiments straight away, as long as you have your smartphone or tablet with you! \n•  Move learning outside: the use of mobile devices along with the types of experiments we offer encourage students to get out of their seats and open their eyes to the world around them through the power of science\n•  Science and data have no secrets: you can easily record your observations, store your data sensors in real-time and analyse them, just as a proper scientist! \n•  Connect the digital and the physical world from your pocket: go through a series of simple tutorials and start having fun with science\n\nWith built-in device sensors as well as external hardware, you can measure light, sound, movement, and much more.  You can also compare results, and even set triggers. \n\nTogether with the external hardware, (not included with the app), students are enabled to conduct more complex experiments, and advance in their scientific studies. As long as the external sensors are compatible with a Bluetooth-connecting device such as a microcontroller, there is no end to what experiments the students can make. Some popular sensors that the app can work with are: light, conductivity, temperature, force, gas, heart rate, respiration, radiation, pressure, magnetism, and many more.\n\nThe app is classroom-friendly, since students can sign in on any device and access their experiments to continue exploring the world, wherever they are!\n\nIf you’re an educator with a Google Classroom account, you can also subscribe to the Teacher Plan, which allows you to integrate the app with Google Classroom and share this integration with your students. You can then create assignments, templates, and experiments in the app and import existing classes from Google Classroom.\n\nPermissions notice:\n\n• Bluetooth: needed to scan for Bluetooth sensor devices.\n• Camera: needed to take pictures to document experiments and for the brightness sensor.\n• Photo Library: needed to store pictures taken to document experiments and for adding existing photos from your library to experiments.\n• Microphone: needed for sound intensity sensor.\n• Push notifications: needed to inform you of recording status when backgrounding the app.\n\nBenefits of using the Arduino Science Journal\n• It’s free and simple to use\n• Easy setup: download the app and start exploring with your phone’s built-in sensors\n• Cross-platform support\n• Portable: enhance your home learning or bring your device outside to study the world around you\n• Safe for children to use: COPPA Compliance underway \n• Fully compatible with Arduino hardware: keep experimenting with the Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab, as well as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board\n• Google Drive integration, as well as local download\n\n---\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.arduino.cc/en/sj-terms-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy\nChildren's Privacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/children-privacy-policy"

      "label": "Lingvist is the language learning app built by scientists and language experts that teaches vocabulary better than anyone else in the world. The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n• 2019 PCMag Editors’ Choice\n• 2019 Tabby Awards Winner\n• 2019 Best Mobile App Awards: Best Designed App and Best Overall App\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next.

      "label": "Елена Шипилова представляет бесплатный курс Французский язык за 7 уроков для начинающих.\n\nПрограмма представлена сайтом: http://speakasap.com\n\nВ курс Французский язык за 7 уроков вошли 7 самых основных базовых тем грамматики (курс не затрагивает правила чтения), которые железно необходимо знать каждому, кто хочет в короткие сроки заговорить на французском языке и кто планирует дальше более глубокое изучение французского языка. \n\nВся теория подана просто и в логической последовательности с хорошим словарным запасом. \n\nТак как упражнения, где нужно тупо кликать на правильный перевод слова или на правильную форму глагола ведут к отупению и неумению соображать самостоятельно, мы сделали упражнения по другому.\n\nВ наших упражнениях нужно самому сделать перевод всего предложения. Всегда можете свериться с ответами. 80% слов Вы найдете либо в теории урока, либо в предыдущих упражнениях, так что заглядывать в словарь на каждом слове совершенно необязательно. И запоминание слов происходит на практике, когда Вы самостоятельно строите фразы и предложения.\n\nЧтобы курс принес максимальную пользу, его нужно проработать несколько раз, а не просто прощелкать за 5 минут. Курс подходит тем, кто готов трудиться и работать.\n\nНу а если что-то вызывает сложность, просто обратитесь в нашу языковую поддержку. Для этого Вам достаточно написать нам email из приложения, либо иметь установленный на телефоне скайп и желание отработать инвестированное в занятие время. Просто позвоните в языковую поддержку и проясните неясные вопросы голосом!\n\n\n***\n\nВозможности программы:\n- полная версия бесплатного курса \"Французский язык за 7 уроков\"\n- интерактивные упражнения для проверки знаний и закрепления материала\n- аудио-материалы с объяснениями уроков и упражнений\n- видео-материалы с объяснениями уроков (требуется подключение к Интернету)\n- быстрый переход на сайт speakASAP\n- быстрое создание письма в службу языковой поддержки speakASAP\n- все материалы (за исключением Видео-раздела) находятся на Вашем устройстве и для использования не требуется подключение к Интернету\n\n***\n\nПодписывайтесь в наши группы:\nhttp://vk.com/speakASAP\nhttp://www.facebook.com/speakASAP\nhttp://twitter.com/speakASAP\nhttp://blog.eustudy.ru\n\nПодписывайтесь на наш канал на youtube:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/eustudy\n\n***\n\nМы так же будем рады получить от Вас любые отклики, комментарии и предложения на адрес: admin@speakasap.com\n\n***\n\n\nУстанавливайте! Тестируйте! Сообщайте о багах! Учите в свое удовольствие!\n\nЗа дополнительным грамматическим материалом обращайтесь на сайт \nhttp://speakasap.com/french_in_7_lessons.html\n\n\nАвтор курса Елена Шипилова и команда speakASAP."

      "label": "If you want to grow your leadership skills but don't have time to read every book or sift through endless blog posts, you're in the right place.\n\nBUNCH is an AI leadership coach that enables you to get 1% better every day in just 2 minutes a day. Curious? Here's what you need to know:\n\n****Leadership is a mindset, not a title****\nWhether you're leading yourself, a team, or an entire company, you have what it takes to be a great leader. Once you've got the mindset, you just need the tools. That's where BUNCH comes in!\n\n****Become the leader YOU want to be****\nNo two leaders are alike. That's why BUNCH uses psychology & AI to create a completely unique learning journey tailored for your leadership style, your role, and your interests - so you can build the skills that matter to you and your team.\n\n****Straight to the point with no fluff****\nEach day you'll get a bite-sized leadership tip that distills one key concept that's relevant for you, inspired & vetted by real-world leaders. They're designed to understood and remembered - like getting a summary of the best blog post you ever read.\n\n****Learn, act, reflect, repeat****\nTrue, stable growth comes from improving 1% every day. Get your tip, take action, and see how it goes. There is no try, only do!\n\n****Top 5 signs you should get BUNCH****\n=> You love to learn but don't have time to read every book or comb through every HBR article\n=> You want to empower those around you to do their best work but don’t know how\n=> You’re frustrated with your team: missed deadlines, re-work, slow progress\n=> You keep running into the same problems on project after project\n=> It feels like there’s always too much work and not enough time\n\nJoin a movement alongside 40,000+ other leaders. Here’s what they’re saying:\n\n\"After using BUNCH for a few months, I find it to be a helpful tool with constantly new and updated tips on leadership, it is eye opening for me in fields I have not explored before. I can recommend it to anyone responsible for a team's performance. Added bonus is that it comes with a community of leaders I can discuss related-topics with, and get specific advice.\" - Nader Alexan, CTO @ Airteam\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH user for months now, and there aren't many services that I'm this excited about! I genuinely believe it can be the lever to catapult your career or business - especially if you don't have time to read all the latest management books and HBR articles, but you still need to lead people in your work.\" - Srđan Stanić, Software Engineer at Gravitus\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH beta tester since the very beginning. Over the last year I've watched the app and the content grow into a truly meaningful product experience. Leaders at all levels can benefit from adopting the 2-minute daily habit. I love binging on tips in my free time, and often share content with my team.\" - Merissa Silk, Head of Product @ fundingport\n\n\"I almost dislike how popular BUNCH is becoming because as a beta user, it always felt like my own personal secret weapon! The coach makes it easy to have a moment of reflection each day, and having met the team behind it, I know they’re serious about their mission and vision to enable anyone to be a better leader.\" - Javier Gutiérrez Boronat, Agile Coach & Entrepreneurship Facilitator\n\n“Bunch gave me a template for how to call out team members who’ve gone above and beyond. The team loves it, and It’s really helped them gain a sense of what excellence looks like in their role.” - Cynthia Gordon, Customer Experience Leader @ [monday.com](http://monday.com/)\n\nReady to take the lead? Try it for a couple of weeks and let us know what you think!\n\n—\nData Protection: [https://www.bunch.ai/data-protection](https://www.bunch.ai/data-protection)\nTerms and Conditions: [https://www.bunch.ai/terms-conditions](https://www.bunch.ai/terms-conditions)"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture.

Score 100% in the games and you can unlock an extra topic for free.\n\n\nWHY UTALK WORKS:\n\n1. LEARN FROM THE LOCALS: We record native speakers so you hear every word pronounced clearly. Mimic their pronunciation and compare your intonation with theirs. Practise until you get it right – you can even slow the audio down if it’s too fast.\n\n2. USEFUL EVERYDAY WORDS AND PHRASES. Topics take around two to three hours to complete. But you can dip in for just five minutes at a time or longer. With 60+ topics, that’s a total of 180 hours of learning.\n\n3. KEEPS YOU MOTIVATED: Check your scores on progress bars as you move through five progressively difficult games. To get full marks, you’ll have to know the words as well as your own language.\n\n\nWHO’S IT FOR? uTalk’s tried and trusted way to learn a new language has been developed over 30 years and is perfect for beginners.

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York. Lively, colorful, and sometimes surprising characters: an eccentric old lady will help you find a place to live, and a greedy hot-dog vendor who will try to short-change… They (and many more) speak different accents and will help you master street talk. There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go. Each conversation takes no more than 3 minutes and will fit into even the busiest of schedules.\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY\n\nYou’ll learn 6,000 of the most common words everyone needs to travel, work, and communicate in a foreign language. Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations. Built-in games will challenge your skill and speed – you can even compete with other users around the world in real-time!"

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education.

      "label": "~Наша мечта – чтобы дети любили читать так же сильно, как играть.~\r\nА мечты нужно воплощать в реальность, поэтому мы создали приложение для веселого и захватывающего обучения чтению детей от 4 до 7 лет.\r\n\r\nМетодика образовательной игры разработана под руководством специалистов в области дошкольного образования. Это объединение всех этапов обучения чтению в одном игровом пространстве. Больше не нужно скачивать множество разных приложений! Наши игры не только помогут научиться читать, но и разовьют мышление, внимание, память и речь ребенка, подготовят ребёнка к школе. \r\n\r\n~Учим звуки и буквы~\r\nДаже если ребенок уже знает буквы - это важный этап для последующего овладения чтением. Ребёнок учится слышать звук в слове (звуковой анализ слова), знакомится с образом буквы, собирая ее из частей и прописывая, и отрабатывает соотношение буквы со звуком.\r\n\r\n~Читаем слоги~\r\nОсвоив первые звуки и буквы, ребёнок сразу сможет перейти к составлению слогов и слов. В разделе собраны игры на умение услышать слог и найти его, собрать слог из букв, отработку техники слогового чтения, чтение разного типа слогов.\r\n\r\n~Слова и предложения~\r\nВсе слова и предложения в играх подобраны таким образом, что в них учтен уже пройденный материал. Сложность нарастает постепенно, позволяя ребёнку двигаться пошагово и обретать большую уверенность в своих силах.\r\n\r\n~Выбирайте готовые уроки~\r\nРебёнок может заниматься самостоятельно! Начинайте обучение с уроков, собранных специально для Вашего малыша педагогами. Это не отдельные мини-игры! Это готовые подборки заданий, прохождение которых последовательно формирует навык чтения на базе одной изучаемой буквы. Проходя их, ребёнок шаг за шагом будет учится читать. Добейтесь прогресса, занимаясь каждый день!  \r\n\r\n~Система наград и достижений~\r\nИграйте с пользой! Образовательное приложение “Смешарики. Учимся читать” поможет ребенку не только получить новые знания, но и провести время увлекательно и с пользой. Система краткосрочной и долгосрочной мотивации поможет ребенку не потерять интерес к знаниям.\r\n\r\n– Сказки, в которые можно еще и играть. Путешествие по страницам сказок и выбор своего героя.\r\n– Аудиоистории про Смешариков. После успешного обучения ребенок будет способен прочитать их самостоятельно.\r\n– Альбомы с наклейками. Расширяем словарный запас. Уникальная коллекция слов, доступных для прочтения\r\n\r\n~Статистика~\r\nВ образовательном приложении реализован специальный раздел “Статистика”. Благодаря собранной в нём информации, у родителей есть возможность следить за прогрессом ребенка и понимать, как идет освоение материала.\r\n\r\n~Приятные бонусы~\r\n– Более 20 развивающих мини-игр, созданных нами в содружестве с опытными психологами и дошкольными педагогами! \r\n– Красочные иллюстрации и анимации, полностью озвучены персонажи и задания, простой и понятный ребёнку интерфейс.\r\n– Система наград и достижений затягивает ребёнка в процесс обучения и способствует достижению отличных результатов.\r\n– Выбор пола и внешности действующего персонажа сказок, чтобы ребёнок мог выбрать близкий для себя образ.\r\n– И, конечно, Смешарики! Любимые герои мультфильмов станут верными помощниками для ребёнка при обучении чтению.\r\n\r\nИграйте с пользой! А мы всегда рады вашей обратной связи, любым отзывам и советам.

В игровой форме вы сможете закрепить свои знания о знаках, их названиях и назначениях. Вы научитесь понимать сходства и различать дорожные знаки, а также отметите важность элементов, составляющих знаки ПДД и дополнительных табличек.\n\nДорожные знаки соответствуют правилам РФ. Знаки дорожного движения разделены на 9 уровней по категориям именно так, как они представлены в ПДД России:\n- Предупреждающие знаки\n- Знаки приоритета\n- Запрещающие знаки ПДД\n- Предписывающие знаки\n- Знаки особых предписаний\n- Информационные знаки ПДД\n- Знаки сервиса\n- Знаки дополнительной информации (таблички)\n- Все дорожные знаки\nПрохождение уровней викторины открывает доступ к последующим уровням.\n\nВикторина послужит помощником для подготовки к теоретическому экзамену в автошколе, тренировки теории вождения автомобиля. Запоминать знаки дорожного движения будет полезно в том числе и для начинающих водителей, пешеходов, детей и школьников, и ученикам автошкол.\n\nПриложение подготовит вас к полному тесту про все дорожные знаки. Сначала в каждой категории дается небольшое количество знаков к изучению. Вы проходите тест и запоминаете знаки ПДД визуально. В конце теста предлагается работа над ошибками. Те знаки дорожного движения, которые были опознаны неверно выписаны в таблице. Вы можете прочитать описание каждого знака."

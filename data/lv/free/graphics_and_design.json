      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

      "label": "Watermarkly is user-friendly, efficient, and straightforward. With our batch-watermarking app, you can add multi-line text or upload your own logo, and customize them in less than no time. Watermarkly never changes the original images or videos. Your watermarks will be added only to a copy.\n\n\nCreate your perfect watermark\n\nIn our app, you will find all the necessary tools to bring your vision to life. Watermarkly allows you to:\n\n• Add copyright symbol or image number to your text\n• Change the size of your watermark\n• Rotate it to any angle\n• Adjust its transparency\n• Fill your photo with repeated watermarks\n• Remove monochrome background from your logo \n\nYou will have access to : \n\n• 33 effects like 3D or drop shadow effect\n• Vast library of 1000 fonts\n• Broad selection of colors, including gradient options\n\n\nAdjust your watermark on each photo\n\nTo make the watermarking process easier and faster, Watermarkly adjusts the size and position of your watermarks automatically if you upload a mixed batch of horizontal and vertical images. But the app still allows you to enlarge, shrink down and reposition your watermark manually on each photo. This can be done in the \nPreview section. \n\n\nSynchronize watermarks across all devices\n\nYour templates will be synchronized between all your devices. Watermarks that you applied to photos at least once are added to the list of the 10 recently used templates. This list gets synchronized automatically, and you can access it whether you are on your phone or computer.  For instance, you design and apply a watermark in our app.  Then you open Watermarkly in Safari on your Mac and see the same watermark on the list of recently used templates. You can select and further customize it or apply it to your photos straightaway. \n\n\nProtect your photos\n\nUnfortunately, in our day and age, it is very easy and not time-consuming for somebody to download your photo and pose it as their own. Image theft happens on social media more often than you think. Moreover, there have been a few cases of well-known brands stealing a small creator’s photo or painting from their account and using it as a print on their clothes. This way, the artists got neither money nor credit for their work. Watermarks can help to prevent your images from being stolen. Place your name or logo on them to claim your copyright. \n\n\nPromote your works\n\nWatermarks can be great not only for protecting your photos but also for getting your name out there. Internet is a peculiar thing; you never know where your images might end up. Even if you post your works on your Instagram account, there is a chance that your potential client might see them in a community on another social media platform with no link to your profile. By adding your logo, website address, or contact information to your images, you will give people who like your art and want to hire you the opportunity to find you easily and quickly."

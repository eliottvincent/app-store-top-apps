      "label": "Интертрикс – это приложение которое поможет вам собирать интерьер из всего что требуется для отдельных помещений. \n\nСобирайте интерьер вашей мечты с помощью методологии “плейсментов” – специальной идеи разработанной для этого приложения. Плейсмент в Интертикс  – это потребность в мебели или чем-либо другом, которую предстоит закрыть. Например “выключатель” – это плейсмент, а варианты выключателя – это уже предметы.\n\nСоздавайте в приложении отдельные комнаты и планируйте бюджет на них, указывайте плейсменты и добавляйте предметы, которыми планируете заполнить конкретный плейсмент. Указывайте стоимость предметов, а так-же фотографии и заметки, чтобы быстро выбрать между двумя вариантами чего-либо, находясь дома, а не в магазине.\n\nКогда вы приобрели что-либо, чем планировали заполнить определнный плейсмент, нажмите кнопку “Приобретено” и Интертрикс автоматически учтет эту покупку в бюджет вашей комнаты, а плейсмент будет закрыт.\n\nБудьте спокойны за то, что ваш ремонт не затянется, ведь занимаясь комнатами по отдельности и планируя бюджет на каждую из них, очень сложно оказаться в ситуации когда ремонт готов на 30% по всех комнатах по отдельности.\n\nЗанимайтесь интерьером проще, с Интертрикс.\n\nПриложение не содержит рекламы или встроенных покупок и полностью работоспособно без подключения к интернету.\n\nПолитика конфиденциальности: https://nagoevamobile.org/intertricks/privacy"

      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

      "label": "A painting app for all artists, whether you’re experienced or just starting out. \nPerfect for creating beautiful works of art or a quick sketch whenever and wherever you have a burst of inspiration.\nYou can also try out ideas and compositions before starting on a new painting in real life, or practise and refine your skills, all without the added cost of art supplies.\n\n• LIFELIKE PASTEL SIMULATION •\nThe app features live-calculated brushes and strokes, making a realistic pastel simulation possible.\nPainting tools include soft pastels, oil pastels, pastel pencils, smudge tool, and more.\n\n• REALISTIC PAPER/CANVAS TEXTURES •\nWhen creating a new picture, a unique, non-repeating paper texture is generated that will interact in real-time with the live-calculated strokes you paint.\nYou can change the default-generated texture to, for example, canvas, which goes great with oil pastels!\n\n• PRECISE COLOR BLENDING •\nWhen painting, especially with soft pastels, use Smudge or the Cotton Swab to blend and smoothen the colors right on the paper, as you would in real life.\nWith oil pastels, in addition to smudging, the blending is often done by the pastel sticks themselves (for best results, reduce the force or use a similar or lighter color).\nIf you use an Apple Pencil, it will feel incredibly realistic if you use the stylus to draw and use your finger to Smudge (assigned as a 2nd tool)!\n\n• FINGERTIP = STROKE SIZE •\nWhen you paint, the app measures how much of your finger is touching the screen and changes the stroke size accordingly.\nThere’s a huge difference between using just the corner of your fingertip and pressing down the whole fingerprint area!\nA 2nd tool assigned to your finger will still use this feature, so don’t ignore it just because you have an Apple Pencil!\n\n• LEFT-HANDED? •\nJust swipe the toolbar over to the other side!\n\n• PARAMETERS CAN BE CHANGED LIVE •\nUse any buttons or controls to change/adjust color, size, force, simultaneously while painting.\n\n• UNIVERSAL PURCHASE •\nIf you choose to buy the Pro upgrade, this one-time in-app purchase will unlock all Pro features in the app on all available platforms (iPad-iPhone-Mac)!\n\n• METAL •\nThe engine is based on Metal, with 128-bit color and floating-point arithmetic.\n\n• SWIFT •\nThe app was developed entirely using Swift (earlier versions used C++).\n\n• APPLE PENCIL SUPPORT • FULL SCREEN PAINTING • SEAMLESS PATTERN EDITING MODE •\n• DARK MODE • LANDSCAPE • PORTRAIT • WIDE COLOR •\n• MULTIPLE LAYERS • PHOTO TRACING MODE (Pro feature) •"

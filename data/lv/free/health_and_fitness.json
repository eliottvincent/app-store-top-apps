      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush.

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "NOT JUST ANOTHER MEDITATION APP\nDon’t think of Waking Up as a conventional meditation app—think of it as a new operating system for your mind, and a guide to living a better life.\n \nWe aim to offer a far deeper approach to mindfulness than you’ll find elsewhere—one that fundamentally transforms how you see yourself, and the world around you.\n \nBut you’ll also discover life-changing, secular wisdom from top scholars and experts, on everything from sleep and doing good in the world to time management and happiness.\n \nWaking Up is free for anyone who can’t afford it. We never want money to be the reason why someone can’t benefit from what we’ve built. \n \n***Created by Sam Harris\nSam Harris, neuroscientist and best-selling author, built Waking Up to be the resource he wished he’d had when he began exploring meditation over 30 years ago.\n \nSam only includes those practices and insights he’s found to be utterly life-changing. The same is true for the many teachers, scholars, and experts you’ll meet throughout the app.\n \n***A step-by-step approach to mindfulness\nWe’ve heard from thousands of members who say they never really understood meditation until they took our 28-part Introductory Course. \n \nWhether you’re a beginner or advanced practitioner, you’ll dive straight into the deep end of real mindfulness, so you don’t waste any time on the surface.\n \n***Learn the true purpose of meditation\nMeditation is about more than just relieving stress, sleeping better, or improving your focus. While it can help you do all of that, our goal is ultimately to help you open the door to a deeper understanding of yourself.\n \nHere, you won’t just uncover simple relaxation techniques —and you won’t find any New Age fluff or religious dogma. \n \n***A place for serious seekers\nExplore some of life’s most important questions, on topics like neuroscience, psychedelics, enlightenment, ethics, and Stoicism—from renowned authors and professors like Oliver Burkeman, Michael Pollan, Laurie Santos, Arthur C. Brooks, James Clear, and others.\n \n***In-depth theory and practice\nWaking Up explains both the theory and the practice of meditation —so you don’t just learn the “how” of mindfulness, but also the “why.” \n \nYou’ll be guided by prominent figures like Joseph Goldstein, Diana Winston, Adyashanti, Jayasāra, and Henry Shukman, who teach a wide range of contemplative practices, including Vipassana, Zen, Dzogchen, Advaita Vedanta, and more.\n \n***Timeless insights, modern lens\nWithin Waking Up, you’ll find some of the most profound spiritual teachings from throughout history—those that have stood the test of time. And you’ll hear from historic voices like Alan Watts.\n \nBut we also pressure-test ancient wisdom against modern science, so you won’t find outlandish claims or anything we haven’t found to be empirically true.\n \n***A comprehensive guide\nWaking Up supports your growth and development in a number of different ways. You’ll find an abundance of useful features, like meditation timers, in-app support messages, an ever-growing audio library, and daily reminders to help bring your mindfulness practice into your life.\n \n“Waking Up is, hands down, the most important meditation guide I’ve ever used.” Physician Peter Attia\n \n“If you’ve had trouble getting into meditation, this app is your answer!” -Susan Cain, best-selling author\n \n“Waking Up is not an app, it’s a path. It is equal parts a meditation guide, a philosophy master-class and a highly-focused TED Conference.” -Eric Hirschberg, former CEO of ACTIVISION\n \nSUBSCRIPTION\nSubscriptions automatically renew, unless auto-renew is disabled at least 24 hours before the current period ends. Manage your subscription from your Apple account settings. Payment will be charged to your Apple account.\n \nTerms of service: https://wakingup.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://wakingup.com/privacy-policy/\nSatisfaction guarantee: If you don’t find the app valuable, email us at support@wakingup.com for a full refund."

      "label": "iHypnobirth has helped 100,000+ women around the globe have a calm, positive and empowered birth and it can help you. iHypnobirth has been designed for pregnant women looking to create a positive and empowered state of mind both before and during the birth of your babies. iHypnobirth Lite contains positive birth affirmations created specifically for labour and birth and now includes relaxing music for birth. \n\niHypnobirth Lite was created by Psychologist & hypnatal practitioner Dr Alex McKay, hypnatal & NLP qualified Charlotte Maslen MA HONs. \n\nWith five children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. \n\nThe effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth Lite will teach you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead the positive affirmations and relaxing music will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally. \n\nBy listening to the relaxation regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing, and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well."

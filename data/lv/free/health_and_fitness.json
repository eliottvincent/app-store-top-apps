      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head.

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

We recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you’re doing activities such as running or biking.\n\nPlease get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits.

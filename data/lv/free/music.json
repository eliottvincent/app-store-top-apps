      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

      "label": "SingTrue can teach anybody to sing in perfect tune. Even if you think you're tone deaf!\n~~ Selected by Apple for iTunes \"Learn an Instrument\" feature. ~~\n\n\"Easy to use.\" -- The New York Times\n\n\"A perfect app\" -- Appolicious.com\n\n\"Amazing, effective and user friendly\" -- AppPicker.com\n\n\"Voice training just got a whole lot easier and less expensive\" -- PreApps.com\n\nWorried that you have a bad voice? Always told you're out of tune or off-key when you sing?\n\nMany people think they can't sing because they don't have \"natural talent\" or weren't born \"musically gifted\". The surprising truth is that anybody can learn to sing well, even those who feel totally unmusical.\n\nSingTrue helps you discover your inner musicality and gain control over your voice to become a natural, confident, powerful singer.\n\n\nApp Store Reviews:\n\n\"Everything I wanted in an app I found on this one! It's easy to use and the exercises are great, I can already feel difference in my singing voice\"\n-- 5 stars, Courteney S, USA\n\n\"Definitely recommend this to anyone who worries at karaoke time!\"\n-- 5 stars \"Always-thinking\", UK\n\n\nHOW SINGTRUE WORKS\n\nSingTrue features over 30 interactive exercises* that help you learn to sing easily, confidently and in perfect tune. By using the iPhone microphone and sophisticated signal processing, the app analyses your singing and provides personal feedback on how you can improve.\n\nSpend a few minutes practicing with the app's exercises every day and you will rapidly become a capable, confident singer.\n\nIf you are already a musician, the app will train your voice and your ears to help you become more confident, more creative, and more musical. In fact, the advanced exercises will help you recognise notes by ear - enabling you to play by ear, write your own music, and improvise freely on your instrument.\n\nThe exercises have been designed by experts, in consultation with some of the leading vocal teachers in the world. Building on the success of the RelativePitch ear training app (featured by Apple and used by over 300,000 musicians) and the Tone Deaf Test (4.5-star rated app used by 170,000+ people), SingTrue has been developed to help more people discover their inner voice and naturally become sensational musicians.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- SingTrue develops your Voice, Ears and Mind for singing\n- Uses the iPhone microphone to analyse your singing and gives personal feedback\n- Over 30 different exercises to explore, with more coming soon*\n- Listening examples provided by professional singers\n- Track your progress in detail and see your voice improving\n- Share your achievements with friends on Facebook, Twitter or Email\n\n\nCOMMON QUESTIONS\n\nQ: What if I'm tone deaf?\nA: Don't worry! You probably aren't. Close to 1 million people have taken our Tone Deaf Test, and just 2% have proved to be genuinely tone deaf. Still worried? Search the App Store for our \"Tone Deaf Test\" app.\n\nQ: Is this just for people who like singing?\nA: No, SingTrue has been designed for singers and non-singers alike.\n\nQ: Can you really learn to sing in tune?\nA: Yes, it's simply a matter of learning pitch sensitivity (ears) and vocal control (voice).\n\nQ: What if I can already sing?\nA: SingTrue can help you become more accurate, more expressive and more confident.\n\n\nApp Store Reviews:\n\n\"This app is great way to learn to sing and to prove to my husband that I'm not tone deaf!\"\n-- 5 stars, Bardils, UK\n\n\"This app is incredibly useful both to the beginner and to the pro singer. Bravo!\"\n-- 5 stars, Richard E, UK\n\n\"I'm not a good singer by any means but with this app I think I finally have a chance to learn. It's been a few hours and I already can notice an improvement. Can't wait to see where I'll get when I have completed all levels.\"\n-- 5 stars, Peter, UK\n\nDownload SingTrue today!\n\nIf you have any other questions or need help getting started, just email support@EasyEarTraining.com and we'll be happy to help.\n\n* Unlocking the full set of exercises requires in-app purchase."

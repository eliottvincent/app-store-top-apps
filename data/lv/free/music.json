      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

The easiest way to get started with real music production.\n\n*** Apple Design Award ***\n*** Best of App Store ***\n*** Editor’s Choice ***\n\nWHY PEOPLE LOVE AUXY\n“Auxy is my favorite way to get what is going on in my brain into a musical format. It is simple on the surface but with tremendous depth if you need it.” - RAC\n\n“The automation is terrific. I am doing things with Auxy I would not easily do in my studio. The design is insanely smart and forward-thinking.” - Madeon\n\n“It is wild bro, you gotta get this!” - Majid Jordan\n\nCREATE AND MIX LOOPS\nBuild melodies and drum loops by drawing notes. Arrange your loops with scenes to explore ideas or make full-length tracks.\n\nDISCOVER GREAT SOUNDS\nBrowse thousands of high quality synth patches, sampled instruments and one-shot samples. You can import samples to the drum machine and build your own melodic instruments.\n\nADD EFFECTS AND AUTOMATION\nAdd studio-grade effects like reverb, delay, distortion and chorus. Fine-tune sounds to find the perfect mix. Create modulation and transitions with powerful automation.\n\nSHARE AND COLLABORATE\nUpload your tracks to SoundCloud or export them as audio or video files. Quickly share links to your projects if you want to collaborate with other producers.\n\nEXPORT TO YOUR FAVORITE DAW\nYou can export projects to Ableton Live, Bitwig Studio or Studio One, which makes Auxy a great sketchpad for producers on the go. You can also bounce projects as separate audio and MIDI files, which can be imported into any popular music-making app.\n\nJAM WITH FRIENDS\nAuxy supports Ableton Link, which lets you jam in sync with other apps and devices connected to the same Wi-Fi.\n\nTRY IT FREE\nAuxy is free to download and evaluate with a limited set of sounds. You also get a 7-day free trial to evaluate all the sounds and features before you start a subscription.\n\nMADE IN SWEDEN\nAuxy is built by a small and independent team in Sweden. Our mission is to put a studio in everyone's pocket and push music forward as an artform.\n\nTHANK YOU AUSTIN HAGA\nThe music in the preview video is made by Austin Haga.

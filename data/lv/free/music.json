For guitar, the categories are:\n*General tunings\n*Raised tunings\n*Lowered tunings\n*Dropped tunings\n*Double dropped tunings\n*Major open tunings\n*Minor open tunings (cross-note)\n*Modal tunings\n*Miscellaneous tunings\n\nIf you have certain tunings that you often use, you can save them as favorites.

Hold the mic close to the source if it is silent like an unplugged electric guitar.\n\nAs a bonus you can change the base frequency for the tuning from 440Hz to something else, if it fits your voice or instrument better.

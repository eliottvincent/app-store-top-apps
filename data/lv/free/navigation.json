Making your life easier, safer and more efficient before, during and after your trip, Flitsmeister is your best friend! \n\nThere are several other ways in which Flitsmeister will make your life easier: \n\n• Mobile and fixed speed cam, speed check zone alerts; to save your hard-earned cash.   \n\n• Traffic jam alerts; check in advance whether you will be encountering a traffic jam on your route and start a new route if necessary. \n\n• Service vehicle alerts such as ambulances and fire trucks, to help you get out of the way calmly and in time so they can reach their destination more quickly.  \n\n• Accidents, roadworks, stationary vehicles and other incident alerts: allowing you to anticipate the situation safely and in time. \n\n• Matrix sign alerts: never miss a closed exit, opened rush hour lane or maximum speed instructions ever again. \n\n• Navigation: the right instructions to get from A to B, taking into account the current situation on the road or recommending a different route if disturbances are expected on your route.  \n\n• Paid parking: start a parking action upon arrival at your destination with the tap of a button. The app will recognise whether you are located in a parking zone to make sure you don’t forget to start the parking action. We will send you a notification as soon as you get back behind the wheel so you never forget to stop your parking action and never overpay. \n\n• Traffic lights: certain traffic lights in the Netherlands will send their current status to the app. The number of these ‘smart’ traffic lights will be increasing in the future, allowing us to show you a countdown for the green light and speed recommendations to keep you in the green wave. \n\n• Apple Carplay for Flitsmeister on the screen of your car: navigate to your destination even more conveniently by displaying Flitsmeister on the screen of your car. Of course, you will also keep receiving the usual alerts for speed cams, traffic jams and hazards during your trip. \n\n\nCOMMUNITY \nOur entire team is dedicated to making the app better and more complete every single day.

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "Huntloc is a real-time hunting, tracking and management app for hunting teams and provides tracking devices for hunting dogs. You can see the movement of hunting dogs and other hunters on your smartphone, share information between hunters and create your own hunting map.\n\nTracking a common hunt is easy\nOne of the members of the hunt starts hunting on his or her phone and receives a unique code. Other hunters join the hunt using this code. This creates a hunting team whose movement is visible on the phone map. When the owner of a hunting dog with a Huntloc tracking device joins the hunt, all participants will also be able to see the dog's location. \nHunting with Huntloc is more effective, safer and more fun\n•\tWhile on a common hunt, your phone shows the current location of dogs and hunters, the direction of movement, the pace of movement, and the distance traveled. Hunting and dog tracking are unlimited in distance.\n•\tDuring the hunt, you can send messages to the participants and share the location of the various hunting events on the map (e.g., a caught game, an animal track, etc.). Plus, you can quickly call any hunter.\n•\tThe different maps of Google and the Estonian Land Board and the hunting objects recorded by the hunter themselves (e.g., animal feeding places and other hunting-related locations and areas) give an accurate overview of the hunting ground. You can share your hunting objects with other Huntloc users. \n•\tWhen navigating in the hunt, you can set a navigation target and then use the compass view to arrive at the desired location by the shortest route.\n•\tA 24-hour weather forecast with sunrise and sunset time will help you plan your hunt. You can view the weather forecast for your own location or for a location selected on the map.\n•\tHuntloc's portal.huntloc.com can be used for viewing the hunts you have participated in and for more convenient drawing of the hunting card.\n\nThe location of a dog with the Huntloc tracking device can be seen on your smartphone\nThe Huntloc tracking device provides a very accurate position of the dog in the terrain. The tracking device uses the mobile network and has no distance limitation - the dog can be tracked from thousands of kilometers away. All you need is a smartphone to monitor your dog and control your device. In addition to tracking, you can call the dog, listen to the dog's activities and give voice commands. Keeping the device constantly on the dog's neck, it acts as a security device and can be switched on from a distance when the dog is lost. \n\nThe tracking device is very strong, lightweight, waterproof and has a long service life. The monitoring time is 36 hours (10 seconds interval) and the standby time is 1 month. In order to ensure waterproofing, there are no openings or buttons on the unit, and the 3 indicator lights indicate the unit's operating status. The device is charged wirelessly."

Just ask Alexa to hear music, news, and more. Also, enjoy Garmin turn-by-turn navigation. Stream the audio (music and other responses) from your vehicle’s stereo when you connect Garmin Speak to your stereo using Bluetooth® or AUX.\r\n \r\nOlder Bluetooth-capable Garmin navigators are compatible with the Garmin Smartphone Link app, and older Wi-Fi-enabled Garmin dash cams can access video footage through the Garmin VIRB app."

      "label": "\"Probably the best map and route planner out there\" - recent customer review\nDon't take our word for it, join over 1 million users who rely on this app daily.\n\n● TRAVEL AT NIGHT ●\n● Now contains routing for the latest TfL night services.\n\n● KEY FEATURES ●\n● Simple, fast and easy to use.\n● Designed for the first time visitor and experienced commuter.\n● Unique \"Travel Explorer\" feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map.\n● Latest official TfL (Transport for London) map. \n● Saves and recalls favourite and recent journeys.\n● Online street map integration (when an internet connection is available).\n● Services can be turned on or off, routing around problems.\n● Easily locates your nearest transport stop.\n● Places of interest, parks etc are built in to the application.\n● Ability to mark up the map with favourite locations and areas.\n\n● OVERVIEW ● The London Underground application is a superb route planner for the London Underground system with many unique features. The inbuilt map provides the official view of the city underground services with the ability to switch to an online street map view when an internet connection is available. This way the user can view the online map feature when above ground and the transport map and route planning is still fully functional underground or anywhere there is no internet connection. \n\n● TRAVEL EXPLORER ● The unique travel explorer feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map. This is helpful for getting a sense of scale and connectivity of the transport system and can provide some interesting results. For example is it quicker to use the tube to go from Covent Garden to Tottenham Court Road or is it quicker on foot? (Hint, the quickest route will keep you fitter). No other application makes it so easy to get around on the tube and allow you to make travel decisions based on the actual distances and travel times on foot.\n\n● ROUTING ● Does not require an internet connection and will always be available to display a clear and detailed view of the city transport system, plus list and animate the optimum route for your journey. Provides the fastest route calculations of any mobile routing application (virtually instantaneous) using actual published journey times with the ability to select the quickest route or the route with the least changes.\nComprehensive details of your planned route are provided, including changes, directions of travel, number of stops, predicted journey times, etc. Uniquely this application gives you “direction”, “towards” and “service frequency” information (not available on any other offline journey planner) for example “Take the Northern line (Southbound) towards Stockwell for 10 mins (6 stops). Service runs every 7 minutes” which is essential when finding the correct platform and connection. Also given are alternatives for each leg of the journey.\n\n● NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED ● The map and routing do not require an internet connection and you will not be charged data connection fees. This also means the application runs perfectly underground, on an aeroplane, etc. For international visitors to a city who have data roaming turned off this is an ideal solution.\n\n● LIVE INFO ● When an internet connection is available, optional \"Live Information\" on the current state of the transport services and real time station departure boards can be viewed allowing you to plan your journeys in advance and avoid any potential delays.\n\n● MORE MAPS ● This map is one in a series of Zuti worldwide city maps, if you like this product you may also enjoy some of our other offerings, please visit www.zuti.co.uk for further information. This is the promotional version of the application, please see the app store for the advert free version.\n\n● NOTE ● Please note this is the free promotional (Pro) version and does contain advertising."

Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "Speed Limit App displays the current speed limit and your current speed. It detects European speed limit signs using the camera while driving and enhances the results by map based limits from OpenStreetMap. Thus it will even know limits which are not indicated by signs (i.e. Zone 30, or inner city areas). Of course it will warn you when you are too fast. \n\n► Working principle of Speed Limit App\nSpeed Limit App is a road sign recognition app. For inner city limits we use map based information from OpenStreetMap. Both information is merged to provide an optimal limit indication. The speedometer gets its data from the GPS and is used to determine wether you are above or below the actual limit of the last detected road sign.\n\n► Limitations of Speed Limit App\nSpeedometer Radar Camera does a computational intensive job that formerly was limited to mainframes. Therefore there are some restrictions:\n\n- At night and in adverse lighting conditions the recognition of road signs might fail due to iPhone camera limitations.\n- The app is optimized for European road signs. Unfortunately there is yet no support for US speed limits.\n- There is no support for 'end of limit' signs yet and no support for place/city signs that might also decrease the speed limit according to local traffic road regulations.\n- Sometimes road signs in narrow turns are missed due to the limited view angle of the camera\n- Sometimes there are missed or false road sign detections\n- Speedometer is updated every second\n\n► Notes from the developer\nIf you like Speed Limit warning Camera please rate the app. If you don't like it please send your suggestions by email to the developer team.

      "label": "Atlas Navi is a Drive to Earn A.I. navigation app that uses live video from your smartphone camera to analyze the road in front of you and automatically detect: \n- traffic in each lane (counting how many vehicles are in each lane in front of you) \n- road construction / road work signs \n- road closures \n- accident detection \n- police vehicles (some countries only) \n- potholes \n- available / free parking space\n\nThe app uses advanced computer vision (A.I.) algorithms to analyze the video feeds from your smartphone camera and detect all the above problems on the road. It does this in the background, without interfering with the navigation instructions. \n\nAtlas Navi analyses the road 25 times per second when used with the camera from your smartphone. It generates 100 times better data than other navigation systems, which helps reroute other drivers to avoid potential traffic congestion and dangerous situations. \nBased on these A.I. detections, the app reroutes other drivers on quicker, safer, and less congested routes. \n\nAtlas Navi only uploads to the server the relevant information for traffic optimization: the type of detections and the GPS co-ordinates of said problem. No images or videos are uploaded unless specifically enabled by the user. If enabled, it can store your road trip recorded videos in the cloud, but the default option is to keep them on your device. \nAtlas Navi rewards drivers who send traffic data with a small amount of $NAVI for each mile they drive if they have a 3D vehicle selected in the app and provide traffic data from their cameras.\n\nYou can of course use Atlas Navi as a standard navigation app, without turning on the smartphone camera or the A.I. detections. You will benefit from all the rerouting and information received from other drivers which will make your route safer and faster. \n\nCurrent features include: \n- Navigation module with very accurate address search function \n- Video recording of your road trips, stored in the cloud or on the device \n- Trip history with associated videos (if any) \n- A.I. camera view - see what the camera is detecting in real time around you. \n- Livestream your road trip by sharing a simple link (the others don't need to download Atlas Navi) \n- Car garage where you can select from 3D vehicles in your garage. Customize, change their color, and choose which one you want to drive with today. \n- Rewards system - get rewarded in $NAVI if others join your Driving Club \n- Driving Club - see the others who have joined your personal club \n- Wallet - rewards earned and spent\n\nAtlas Navi is adding more features on a bi-weekly basis and will keep you updated with the latest innovation in avoiding traffic using A.I."

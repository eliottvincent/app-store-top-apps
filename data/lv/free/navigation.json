      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

Once the destination has been selected all navigation is off-line and data free.\n\nNOTE - For navigation the app does require that your iPad has a SIM slot (3G/4G slot), as only these iPads have the full GPS capabilities and antennas. You do not need a SIM to be installed for the data free GPS navigation. A WiFi-only iPad does not contain the in-built GPS that a WiFi+Cellular (SIM slot) iPad does and we do not recommend this app for Wifi only iPads. If your iPad is Wifi only, then you will be able to view the entire Spain maps, however full navigation will not function. The app is suitable for all iPhones.\n\n• All map data stored on your iPhone or iPad - no download costs for mapping or navigation after initial map download\n• Full-fledged turn-by-turn voice navigation including street names\n• Local online search for a specific address or place, service and shop. 'Pizza' 'Library' or 'Hostptal'\n• Set your own speed warnings for in and out of town\n• Street sign displays\n• 3D-view, with user options for 2D view during navigation\n• Selectable Route Types - Car efficient, fastest, shortest, Pedestrian (options map turns to north facing or direction), Bike fastest, shortest and quietest\n• Options to avoid toll roads, ferries and highways\n• Automatic night and day mode\n• Up to three alternative routes to choose from\n• Optional setting of a waypoint for a place you want to visit along your route\n• Time remaining in journey, your actual speed and distance remaining\n• Supports landscape and portrait views\n\nRemember for safety sake - do not adjust the settings on this app while driving. The iPad version is perfect for the passenger ‘navigator’. Position your device safely, out of the way of airbags and not obstructing the drivers vision. You are responsible for ensuring the road is safe to travel on. We do not accept responsibility for errors generated by unreported road works or the weather. You assume total responsibility and risk for using this satellite navigation app. Please note that as with all navigation apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can decrease battery faster than normal.\n\nPlease be kind with us for your reviews and ratings and please email admin@outbacktouring.com.au for support or to bug report.

      "label": "Huntloc is a real-time hunting, tracking and management app for hunting teams and provides tracking devices for hunting dogs. You can see the movement of hunting dogs and other hunters on your smartphone, share information between hunters and create your own hunting map.\n\nTracking a common hunt is easy\nOne of the members of the hunt starts hunting on his or her phone and receives a unique code. Other hunters join the hunt using this code. This creates a hunting team whose movement is visible on the phone map. When the owner of a hunting dog with a Huntloc tracking device joins the hunt, all participants will also be able to see the dog's location. \nHunting with Huntloc is more effective, safer and more fun\n•\tWhile on a common hunt, your phone shows the current location of dogs and hunters, the direction of movement, the pace of movement, and the distance traveled. Hunting and dog tracking are unlimited in distance.\n•\tDuring the hunt, you can send messages to the participants and share the location of the various hunting events on the map (e.g., a caught game, an animal track, etc.). Plus, you can quickly call any hunter.\n•\tThe different maps of Google and the Estonian Land Board and the hunting objects recorded by the hunter themselves (e.g., animal feeding places and other hunting-related locations and areas) give an accurate overview of the hunting ground. You can share your hunting objects with other Huntloc users. \n•\tWhen navigating in the hunt, you can set a navigation target and then use the compass view to arrive at the desired location by the shortest route.\n•\tA 24-hour weather forecast with sunrise and sunset time will help you plan your hunt. You can view the weather forecast for your own location or for a location selected on the map.\n•\tHuntloc's portal.huntloc.com can be used for viewing the hunts you have participated in and for more convenient drawing of the hunting card.\n\nThe location of a dog with the Huntloc tracking device can be seen on your smartphone\nThe Huntloc tracking device provides a very accurate position of the dog in the terrain. The tracking device uses the mobile network and has no distance limitation - the dog can be tracked from thousands of kilometers away. All you need is a smartphone to monitor your dog and control your device. In addition to tracking, you can call the dog, listen to the dog's activities and give voice commands. Keeping the device constantly on the dog's neck, it acts as a security device and can be switched on from a distance when the dog is lost. \n\nThe tracking device is very strong, lightweight, waterproof and has a long service life. The monitoring time is 36 hours (10 seconds interval) and the standby time is 1 month. In order to ensure waterproofing, there are no openings or buttons on the unit, and the 3 indicator lights indicate the unit's operating status. The device is charged wirelessly."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

      "label": "Atlas Navi is a Drive to Earn A.I. navigation app that uses live video from your smartphone camera to analyze the road in front of you and automatically detect: \n- traffic in each lane (counting how many vehicles are in each lane in front of you) \n- road construction / road work signs \n- road closures \n- accident detection \n- police vehicles (some countries only) \n- potholes \n- available / free parking space\n\nThe app uses advanced computer vision (A.I.) algorithms to analyze the video feeds from your smartphone camera and detect all the above problems on the road. It does this in the background, without interfering with the navigation instructions. \n\nAtlas Navi analyses the road 25 times per second when used with the camera from your smartphone. It generates 100 times better data than other navigation systems, which helps reroute other drivers to avoid potential traffic congestion and dangerous situations. \nBased on these A.I. detections, the app reroutes other drivers on quicker, safer, and less congested routes. \n\nAtlas Navi only uploads to the server the relevant information for traffic optimization: the type of detections and the GPS co-ordinates of said problem. No images or videos are uploaded unless specifically enabled by the user. If enabled, it can store your road trip recorded videos in the cloud, but the default option is to keep them on your device. \nAtlas Navi rewards drivers who send traffic data with a small amount of $NAVI for each mile they drive if they have a 3D vehicle selected in the app and provide traffic data from their cameras.\n\nYou can of course use Atlas Navi as a standard navigation app, without turning on the smartphone camera or the A.I. detections. You will benefit from all the rerouting and information received from other drivers which will make your route safer and faster. \n\nCurrent features include: \n- Navigation module with very accurate address search function \n- Video recording of your road trips, stored in the cloud or on the device \n- Trip history with associated videos (if any) \n- A.I. camera view - see what the camera is detecting in real time around you. \n- Livestream your road trip by sharing a simple link (the others don't need to download Atlas Navi) \n- Car garage where you can select from 3D vehicles in your garage. Customize, change their color, and choose which one you want to drive with today. \n- Rewards system - get rewarded in $NAVI if others join your Driving Club \n- Driving Club - see the others who have joined your personal club \n- Wallet - rewards earned and spent\n\nAtlas Navi is adding more features on a bi-weekly basis and will keep you updated with the latest innovation in avoiding traffic using A.I."

With the countdown timer, people who want to set up their home appliances to make the most of low-cost electricity can do so accordingly.\n\nAUTOMATIC ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING WHEN ELECTRICITY IS THE CHEAPEST AND CLEANEST\n\nGridio automatically charges your car when electricity is the cheapest, and usually the cleanest. After you plug in your vehicle, our algorithms will automatically charge up your vehicle’s battery by your desired time, when electricity is the cheapest. You can automatically avoid expensive peak-time hours, and by doing so help the grid as well as save on your energy bill, if you have dynamic tariffs. \n\nMAKE THE MOST OF YOUR SOLAR PANELS\n\nGridio maximizes your home solar use, by automatically charging your car when you produce enough solar and stopping the charging when the solar production drops. This allows you to maximize your self-consumption of solar and makes your EV an even greener member of our world. You can set your solar charge limits yourself, and soon we will also add automatic price optimization to it.\n\nNO HARDWARE REQUIRED\n\nEverything works through the app - you connect your vehicle securely to Gridio, set your charging needs and we will take care of the rest\n\n***\n\nIf you are using the Gridio app, please let us know what you think. How could we make your life easier? You can provide feedback through support@gridio.io.\nIf you have further questions, visit www.gridio.io and check out our FAQ section in the app and online.\n\nAlso, please like us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/gridio.io/"

In addition, then the GPS reception is active in the background. This can quickly drain the battery. Using the app abroad may incur additional roaming charges if your roaming feature is enabled. However, the UTA app also works in offline mode, provided that acceptance point data has already been downloaded in advance.\n \nMore information about our extensive services can be found at https://www.uta.com.\n \nIf you have questions or criticism, we look forward to receiving an email at: info@uta.com app@uta.com\n \nOur privacy policy can be found here: https://www.uta.com/dataprotectioninformation https://web.uta.com/en/data-protection\n \nLegal notice: https://www.uta.com/www.uta.com/legalnotice https://web.uta.com/en/-2eu/legal-notice"

      "label": "PHOTOREALISTIC 3D MAPS FOR BETTER TRIP PLANNING\nThe award-winning outdoor navigation app is the perfect tool for planning your next trip and finding your way around. The unique photo-realistic 3D representation of the mountain landscape allows an intuitive, realistic assessment of the terrain and the requirements. Many practical features help you to plan your next trip. These include GPS tracking, a routing function, GPX import into the 3D map and map download for offline use.\n\n\n\nMAPS FOR SUMMER & WINTER\nThe 3D map summer is based on aerial photos with a resolution of 20 cm and a matchless terrain model with a resolution of 60 cm. For winter we provide a 3D relief map with all ski resorts and high-resolution aerial photos for selected regions.\n\n\n\nQUALITY-CERTED TOURS \nThe app offers hiking, mountain, ski and bike tours exclusively researched by experts from Bergverlag Rother and other partners. For all tours there is an elevation profile, photos and directions. With the GPS function, you can easily follow the marked route while on tour. A highlight is the import of any tours in GPX format or from Komoot into the 3D map.\n\n\n\nSIMPLE AND SAFE ORIENTATION ON THE MOVE\nWith the combination of 3D map, aerial photo and topographical relief map on a scale of 1:25,000, you can perfectly prepare yourself for a trip. With the routing function, you can plan new routes on the 3D map. The GPS tracking function turns your smartphone into a full-fledged navigation device. On tour, your current location is always displayed live on the map. A virtual 360° panorama with information about the surrounding landscape makes it easier for you to find your way around.\n\n\n\nRECORD YOUR OWN TRACKS\nWith the tracking function, you can record your track and display the route covered live on the 3D map. Duration, distance, altitude and speed are continuously determined. With a user account, you can save the recorded tracks in your personal tour cloud, transfer your tracks to other smartphones or tablets and share them with friends.\n\n\n\nMORE SAFETY IN THE MOUNTAINS - OFFLINE MAPS\nThe app offers an unprecedented level of security. In the photo-realistic 3D map you can read the exposure and condition of the terrain and identify danger spots. In bad weather, in fog or at night, you can find your way around as the map depicts the real terrain. Another safety aspect: you can load the maps onto your smartphone for offline use.\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVELY FOR PREMIUM USERS\nWith a PREMIUM subscription, you can record, save, share and transfer your tracks to other devices, save maps offline on your smartphone, import tours in GPX format and from Komoot, and plan tours in 3D. With the subscription we finance the further development of the app and the creation of the 3D maps. The subscription runs through the store and can be canceled at any time.\n\n\n\nFREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION\nWith a test subscription you can use all PREMIUM functions for one week free of charge.\n\n\n\nFor more information visit https://www.realitymaps.app/realitymaps-app/\n\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.realitymaps.app/agb/"

Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

Die Preise von Super E5, Super E10, Diesel, Autogas (LPG) und Erdgas (CNG) werden angezeigt.\n\neinfach-tanken ist an die Markttransparenzstelle für Kraftstoffe über kraftstoffbilliger.de mit Echtzeit-Preisen angeschlossen. Somit erhälst du die neuesten Preise, auch bei Preisänderungen auf dein iPhone oder iPad!\n\nNach dem Starten der App kannst du zwischen der manuellen Eingabe eines Ortes mit Autovervollständigung und einer GPS Standortlokalisierung wählen. Für die Lokalisierung, aktiviere bitte GPS in deinem Gerät. Der zuletzt gesuchte Ort wird praktischerweise für die nächste Suche gespeichert.\n\nDann erhälst du eine Übersicht mit den Tankstellen in dem gewählten Ort. Diese sind nach den Spritpreisen sortiert: Günstige Tankstellen sind oben, teure Tankstellen unten. Falls du an einer Tankstelle den Sprit nicht bekommen solltest, da diese beispielsweise geschlossen hat, wird diese unter den Ergebnissen unten am Ende ohne Preisangabe dargestellt.\nWähle zwischen den Kraftstoffarten Super E5 (normales Super Benzin), Super E10, Diesel, Autogas (LPG) und Erdgas (CNG). Diese Einstellung wird automatisch für die nächste Verwendung gespeichert.\n\nDann erhälst du bei der Auswahl einer Tankstelle weitere Informationen, wie eine Karte oder die Öffnungszeiten. Du kannst einzelne Tankstellen zur Favoritenliste hinzufügen, um diese später gebündelt aufzurufen. Die Favoritenliste wird nach Spritpreisen sortiert und richtet sich auch nach der aktuell eingestellten Kraftstoffart auf der Startseite.\n\nDu magst gerne den Dark Mode nutzen? Mit einfach-tanken kein Problem. Unsere App passt sich automatisch deinen Systemeinstellungen an. Alternativ lässt sich der Dark Mode manuell in den Einstellungen der App ein- oder ausschalten.\n\nIn den Einstellungen kannst du zudem den Suchradius individuell festlegen. So kann in der Stadt ein kleinerer Radius sinnvoll sein und auf dem Land ein etwas größerer. Bei Bedarf kannst du die Sortierung der Ergebnisse umstellen. Standardmäßig wird nach den Spritpreisen sortiert, alternativ kann nach Entfernung sortiert werden.\n\nWir übernehmen keine Gewähr. Bei Problemen, Fehlern oder Anmerkungen bitte unter support@codemec.com melden. Bitte melde dich bei Problemen zuvor, anstatt eine schlechte Bewertung abzugeben, vielen Dank! Wir hoffen, dass euch unsere neue und übersichtliche Tank App weiterhilft.\n\nEULA und Benutzungsbedingungen (InAppPurchase):\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

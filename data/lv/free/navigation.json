      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

With the countdown timer, people who want to set up their home appliances to make the most of low-cost electricity can do so accordingly.\n\nAUTOMATIC ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING WHEN ELECTRICITY IS THE CHEAPEST AND CLEANEST\n\nGridio automatically charges your car when electricity is the cheapest, and usually the cleanest. After you plug in your vehicle, our algorithms will automatically charge up your vehicle’s battery by your desired time, when electricity is the cheapest. You can automatically avoid expensive peak-time hours, and by doing so help the grid as well as save on your energy bill, if you have dynamic tariffs. \n\nMAKE THE MOST OF YOUR SOLAR PANELS\n\nGridio maximizes your home solar use, by automatically charging your car when you produce enough solar and stopping the charging when the solar production drops. This allows you to maximize your self-consumption of solar and makes your EV an even greener member of our world. You can set your solar charge limits yourself, and soon we will also add automatic price optimization to it.\n\nNO HARDWARE REQUIRED\n\nEverything works through the app - you connect your vehicle securely to Gridio, set your charging needs and we will take care of the rest\n\n***\n\nIf you are using the Gridio app, please let us know what you think. How could we make your life easier? You can provide feedback through support@gridio.io.\nIf you have further questions, visit www.gridio.io and check out our FAQ section in the app and online.\n\nAlso, please like us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/gridio.io/"

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

      "label": "Moscow Metro\n\nNew convenient routes\n\nWith the updated Moscow Metro app, it has become even easier to build routes around the metro and the city! We have increased the launch speed of the service by 3 times, and also changed the principle of navigation.\n\nBuild routes around the metro and the city taking into account your preferences: the fastest or with the least number of transfers.\n\nWith the help of new filters, you will find out at which stations you can drink coffee, buy flowers and much more.\n\nNow Mosmetro passengers will be able to find out about the occupancy of the cars of the incoming train. The station card will display a train informing about the occupancy of each car in real time. And also added a function that shows how long the train will arrive.\n\nWhen you select a station, a card appears in the application where you can view useful information about it. If, for example, an escalator is being repaired nearby, you will be able to see the details of these works, including the timing.\n\nMetro exits and nearby transport are combined into a single block so that passengers can easily find their stop. This is complemented by a map of the city, with which it is easy to build a further path if the user prefers walking.\n\nCity\n\nThe city map has become much better and more informative. Now you can build routes on public transport, car or bicycle on the city map and follow them. Also added useful features such as traffic jams, search by category, save favorite places to favorites, view the history of your routes and much more.\n\nPassenger's personal account\n\nThe application now has a personal account where you can manage the Troika card online.\nNow, when linking the Troika card to an account in your personal account, do not worry about losing the card – the balance can be transferred to another card.\nSet up automatic replenishment or notification of a decrease in the card balance.\nGet points under the loyalty program \"City\" for replenishing the \"Troika\" card.\nKeep a history of trips and operations performed.\n\n\nChatbot of Alexander\n\nEverything you wanted to know about the subway, but didn't know where to ask. Our chatbot will quickly and amiably answer any questions online.\n\nNow passengers will not need to waste time searching for the necessary information. In a matter of seconds, a virtual interlocutor will help you make an application for the maintenance of the Central control center and the warehouse of forgotten things, give a historical reference about the metro, tell you about the operating mode of stations and closures during repairs, tell you all the necessary addresses and contacts, connect you with the operator if you do not want to communicate with artificial intelligence, and much more.\n\nAlexandra will continue to study, combining it with her main job. We will definitely report on her skills.\n\nOther updates\n\nA dark theme has appeared in the application.\n\nThe news section has been updated. Now the news is divided into 3 categories:\n\nImportant, where up-to-date information about restrictions on metro lines is collected;\n\nNews, where the latest news related to the Moscow Metro will be published\n\nThe official Twitter account of the Moscow Metro for operational information about the work of the metro."

You can see the movement of hunting dogs and other hunters on your smartphone, share information between hunters and create your own hunting map.\n\nTracking a common hunt is easy\nOne of the members of the hunt starts hunting on his or her phone and receives a unique code. Other hunters join the hunt using this code. This creates a hunting team whose movement is visible on the phone map. When the owner of a hunting dog with a Huntloc tracking device joins the hunt, all participants will also be able to see the dog's location. \nHunting with Huntloc is more effective, safer and more fun\n•\tWhile on a common hunt, your phone shows the current location of dogs and hunters, the direction of movement, the pace of movement, and the distance traveled. Hunting and dog tracking are unlimited in distance.\n•\tDuring the hunt, you can send messages to the participants and share the location of the various hunting events on the map (e.g., a caught game, an animal track, etc.). Plus, you can quickly call any hunter.\n•\tThe different maps of Google and the Estonian Land Board and the hunting objects recorded by the hunter themselves (e.g., animal feeding places and other hunting-related locations and areas) give an accurate overview of the hunting ground. You can share your hunting objects with other Huntloc users. \n•\tWhen navigating in the hunt, you can set a navigation target and then use the compass view to arrive at the desired location by the shortest route.\n•\tA 24-hour weather forecast with sunrise and sunset time will help you plan your hunt. You can view the weather forecast for your own location or for a location selected on the map.\n•\tHuntloc's portal.huntloc.com can be used for viewing the hunts you have participated in and for more convenient drawing of the hunting card.\n\nThe location of a dog with the Huntloc tracking device can be seen on your smartphone\nThe Huntloc tracking device provides a very accurate position of the dog in the terrain. The tracking device uses the mobile network and has no distance limitation - the dog can be tracked from thousands of kilometers away. All you need is a smartphone to monitor your dog and control your device. In addition to tracking, you can call the dog, listen to the dog's activities and give voice commands. Keeping the device constantly on the dog's neck, it acts as a security device and can be switched on from a distance when the dog is lost. \n\nThe tracking device is very strong, lightweight, waterproof and has a long service life. The monitoring time is 36 hours (10 seconds interval) and the standby time is 1 month. In order to ensure waterproofing, there are no openings or buttons on the unit, and the 3 indicator lights indicate the unit's operating status. The device is charged wirelessly."

Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under \"Settings / Advanced settings\" in iOS 7."

You can then tap to view street view, share or get directions (via Apple Maps or iMaps+).\n\nAlternatively, drag the yellow peg man from the top left hand corner of the map and release over a road or path to access street view.\n\nStreet view supports zooming in and out, and showing a mini-map overlay. There is also a full screen mode for a more immersive experience.\n\nIf you need a more complete Google Maps experience, look for \"iMaps+ for Google Maps\" on the App Store. iMaps+ provides all the great functionality from iStreets with the addition of directions, traffic, contacts integration and more.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nSubscriptions: iStreets operates as a subscription service. Recurring purchase is required for full functionality. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed, and auto-renewal may be turned off, from iStreets settings or the Apple Settings app. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited if you change your subscription term.\n\nDirections, street view and live traffic details are only available in certain geographical regions.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nTerms of Service: http://apptility.co.uk/imaps_tos.html\n\nApptility Limited is not related to, or affiliated with, Google, Inc.

The UTA Stationsfinder app is available in Bulgarian, Danish, German, English, Finnish, French, Italian, Croatian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Czech and Hungarian.\n \nHINTS:\n \nIn order for the app to notify you of the nearest UTA stations, location services must be enabled in your smartphone's settings. In addition, then the GPS reception is active in the background. This can quickly drain the battery. Using the app abroad may incur additional roaming charges if your roaming feature is enabled. However, the UTA app also works in offline mode, provided that acceptance point data has already been downloaded in advance.\n \nMore information about our extensive services can be found at https://www.uta.com.\n \nIf you have questions or criticism, we look forward to receiving an email at: info@uta.com app@uta.com\n \nOur privacy policy can be found here: https://www.uta.com/dataprotectioninformation https://web.uta.com/en/data-protection\n \nLegal notice: https://www.uta.com/www.uta.com/legalnotice https://web.uta.com/en/-2eu/legal-notice"

This App gives you the ability to find out all the details of the ship, including size, speed, course, destination, estimated time of arrival and much more. All done with an easy to use and great looking App, which supports both iPhone and iPad.\n\nWhat people are saying about our App: \"Best user interface of any ship app I have tried\" B. Colson, Maine. \"Love the graphical design and the large icons that makes it easy to determine the ship type\" R. Clark, London. \n\nOpenSeaMap data is now accessible from within the app giving the possibility of showing the map data delivered by OpenSeaMap which includes seamarks, navigational rules and buoys in many areas of the world.\n\nFurthermore, you may measure the distance to the ships from your position, as you may measure distance between any two ships. This will show you if they are really on collision course or if it's just an illusion.\n\nSee the ships displayed on the map with large and crystal clear icons.\n\nBuilt-in compass and \"direction\" vector which helps find the direction of the ships and vessels. \n\nFurthermore, images of the ships may be watched or uploaded directly from the app.\n\nThis version supports iOS split screen multitasking found on selected device.\n\nAlso we added the possibility to place user defined waypoints on the map (press and hold your finger on map). The waypoints can be used as measurement points from the user or between ships. Furthermore, by pressing the waypoint the position is copied to the clipboard, making it easy to paste positions into other applications. Pressing the callout of the waypoint will prepare a text message with the position ready to send to other users.Once the text message is received the user can press it and get the position up in various map apps. This functionality has been requested by search and rescue workers who would like a tool to help pin point positions to colleagues out at sea.\n\nMake sure to check out our FREE version of the app (Trackaship Superlite) before buying if in doubt about the coverage of you local area. The free version will show the same ships, but not any details.\n\nThis app depends on the data received via the Internet and is dependent on the Internet for displaying data. \n\nData is collected on a voluntary basis and may change without notice. If you live in an area with poor or no coverage, you have possibility to improve the situation. Send an email to bbmtrackers@gmail.com and we will contact you. \n\nPlease note that the accuracy and reliability of data in this app are not covered by any guarantee and that, under no circumstances should be used for navigation. This app is no substitute for proper maritime instruments."

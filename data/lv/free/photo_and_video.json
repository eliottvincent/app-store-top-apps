Pick the layout you like best, then edit it to make it your own.\n\nLayout's smooth, intuitive process gives you complete creative control. Tap to mirror, flip or replace images, hold and drag to swap them, pinch to zoom in or out, or pull the handles to resize. You're the editor, so get creative—tell a story, show off an outfit or just splice, dice and change the look of your regular photos to convey a mood or theme. \n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Re-mix up to 9 of your photos at a time to create fun, personalized layouts.\n* Use the Faces tab to quickly find photos with people in them.  \n* Capture the moment in Photo Booth mode with quick, spontaneous shots.  \n* Save your layouts to your camera roll and share them seamlessly to Instagram or other networks.\n* Easily see the last 30 photos you've selected in the Recents tab. \n* Pair your layouts with Instagram's filters and creative tools afterwards to make them stand out even more. \n* Download and start creating immediately.

      "label": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any LG Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your LG TV.\n\nThis works on any LG Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. \n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your LG TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for LG TV app. It will start looking for your LG TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model LG TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for LG TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nYou can purchase the Mirror for LG TV Pro Version through an in app purchase.\n\nThe Pro Version has the following features:\n1. Adds audio to the screen mirroring\n2. Provides for free lifetime updates of the app\n3. Gives the option to choose higher screen resolutions, like 720p and 1080p\n\n* Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n* Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.\n* Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nFeel free to check:\n\nOur Terms of Use: http://bit.ly/ABTV-TOU21\nOur Privacy Policy: http://bit.ly/ABTVPrivacy\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail on support@airbeam.tv"

      "label": "How to turn your mobile into a professional camera in a blink? We did something cool.\r\n\r\nApplying advanced computational photography and artificial intelligence algorithms, ReLens can instantly turn your phone into a professional DSLR camera.\r\nWith its powerful DSLR-grade large aperture that creates background bokeh and its professional 4K Ultra HD camera, ReLens camera makes it easy to capture \"DSLR-like\" and \"cinematic\" shots.\r\n\r\nReLens is designed to be a professional camera app for mobile photography enthusiasts and to help everyone enjoy the fun of photography easily.\r\n \r\n\r\n# Excellent features\r\n\r\n● F1.4 large aperture with background bokeh effect, say goodbye to simple and dull Gaussian Blur. Essential for portrait mode photography.\r\n\r\n● Reproduction of several classic SLR lenses, such as 50mm 1.4 fixed focal length lens, M35mm f/1.4 “the King of Bokeh”, and Burnside 35, the Swirly bokeh effect lens.\r\n\r\n● AI recalculates the depth of field and adds realistic camera bokeh effects.\r\n\r\n● Various professional lens optical effects such as eclipse, Smooth Trans Focus, out-of-focus reflex, out-of-focus rotation, radiation, color shift, etc. give you a realistic lens experience.\r\n\r\n● Simulation of shutter blade shapes, over twenty realistic camera bokeh shapes such as the pentagram, hexagon, Octagon, heart, etc.\r\n\r\n● Reproduction of the unique spots, textures, and light effects of classic lenses.\r\n\r\n● AI HDR brightness algorithm brings your scrap photos to life. Unlike traditional photo brightness enhancement, ReLens fixes photos with less noise and an even distribution of brightness.\r\n\r\n● AI analyses the photo scene and applies 5 different brightness fix modes: ultra-low light mode, slightly low light mode, normal low light mode, normal light mode, and backlight mode.\r\n\r\n● Intelligent partitioning for you to adjust different depth-of-field layers. You can tone the foreground or background or the sky without impacting the rest of the image.\r\n\r\n● More specialized color toning tools, such as Posterization, Curves, and HSL.\r\n\r\n● Freely modify the depth of field information of the image with the depth brush.\r\n \r\n \r\n# All-Purpose Professional Camera \r\n \r\n● iPhone front and rear 20x magnification and a 136mm telephoto lens comparable to a DSLR.\r\n\r\n● Manual control of Exposure, Shutter, ISO, Focus, and White Balance.\r\n\r\n● Support 4K and 4K MAX video recording (up to 60 FPS). High-quality video recording with up to 120 Mbps encoding rate. Enjoy Promovie filming.\r\n\r\n● 20x digital zoom to look further than the original camera.\r\n\r\n● Support for Single Autofocus (AF-S) and Continuous Autofocus (AF-C).\r\n\r\n● Supports iPhone, iPad, and all other devices.\r\n\r\n● Professional aids: horizontal lines, grid lines, exposure zebra stripes, etc.\r\n\r\nMore features are coming soon.\r\n \r\n \r\n# Multiple Classic Camera Lenses\r\n \r\n● Burnside is inspired by the Lensbaby Burnside 35, creating a bubble-like swirling bokeh. It requires a central composition, and a heavily textured background separated from the subject to get this effect.\r\n● Petzval is inspired by Lomography’s Petzval 55mm F1.7 Mark II. This historic lens is best known for the beautiful large swirling bubble bokeh around its focus and it becomes a favorite of most “hipster” photographers as the year pass.\r\n● Sigma was inspired by the doughnut blur produced by the Sigma MF 600 mm, creating a dreamy image. Sometimes these doughnuts are distracting from your focus.\r\n● Sony STF is inspired by Sony FE 100mm f/2.8 STF GM OSS, delivering both smooth blur and fine sharpness with rounded out-of-focus highlights in both the foreground and background blur.\r\n \r\nMore camera lenses are coming soon. Stay tuned!!\r\nDownload ReLens and enjoy weekly updated resources.\r\n \r\n\r\n# Contact Us\r\nrisingcabbage@163.com\r\n\r\n#More Information\r\n-Privacy Policy: https://www.risingcabbage.com/privacy.html\r\n-Terms of Use: https://www.risingcabbage.com/agreement.html"

Enjoy the show on your big screen. \n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> UPGRADE FEATURES (available as in-app purchases)\n\n* Premium Edition: Unlocks all of the features listed here. Also future features are included, so you do not have to pay for them when they are released in an updated app version. \n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker: Blocks ads & popups on most websites and removes the sponsoring ads from the app. You can update and enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!! And you designed it work easily and quickly\"\nRyan, England\n\n“I looooove your app. It has taken my Chromecast to a whole new level.”\nRosalind Romero, USA\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here.

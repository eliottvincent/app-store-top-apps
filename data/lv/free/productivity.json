      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

Personalized spam filter will protect you from annoying bulk mail. Stay in touch all the time with the Mail.ru Mail app!\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\nBy the way, developers are unable to respond to comments in the App Store. So please send your requests, complaints, and suggestions through the app's \"Feedback\" section or by email to mailapps@corp.mail.ru. We'll always respond to your mail!\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\n- Support for multiple accounts. Add all your mailboxes and easily switch between them. Now switching between your work- and personal email accounts is as easy as switching between folders within a single mailbox.\n\n- Full synchronization. It doesn't matter if you use your computer or your mobile device to read, flag, or move your email. All your changes will be saved on the server and synchronized between devices.\n\n- Mail.ru address book. When you compose an email, your contact list and autocompletion suggestions will include email addresses from your local address book as well as from the server. The email addresses that you write to most often will be displayed on a separate tab in your contact list for fast and easy access.\n\n- Full mail search Use search to quickly find any email in your mailbox. Filters will help you refine your search and more quickly find what you're looking for.\n\n- Push-notifications for new mail. You'll know about a new message almost instantly if your iOS device is online.\n\n- Notification filtering Set the time when you want to receive notifications; choose specific services and folders; or create a custom filter to receive only the notifications you care about!\n\n- Mail caching. Your mail is stored in your phone's memory and will be available offline. Read messages and look at attachments on the bus or in the country.\n\n- Personalized spam filter. Tired of receiving email coupons? Do you get messages from services that you signed up for a long time ago, but don't read any more? Press the Spam button and all subsequent mail received the sender will be automatically put in the Spam folder. And you'll be able to read only the messages that matter to you.\n\n- Avatars in your message list (can be disabled on the iPhone and iPod). Photos in your message list make it easier to navigate.\n\n- Quick actions. Slide your finger across an email from right to left to open the email action menu. Without opening a message, you can mark it as read, or flag, move, or delete it.\n\n- iPad version. It's two display modes (portrait and landscape) make the app convenient to use no matter how you hold your tablet."

Weaker encryption isn't even an option\n• Global VPN network: With servers in 22+ countries and lightning-fast speeds, access the websites and apps you love. Anytime, anywhere\n• Helpful support that always responds within 24 hours\n\nWHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\"TunnelBear is an elegant, easy mobile VPN that keeps you safe.\"\n  - Lifehacker\n\n\"The app is bursting with charm, but it also delivers security at a good price.\"\n  - PCMag\n\n\"All you have to do is turn the switch to \"ON\" and you are protected.\"\n  - WSJ\n\n\"TunnelBear, the gorgeous VPN app that wants to bring online privacy to everyone.\"\n  - VentureBeat\n\nPRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE:\n*Spoiler alert* TunnelBear has a strict no-logging policy.

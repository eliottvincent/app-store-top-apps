      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\nActivity widgets require a paired Apple Watch\n\nThe app itself also includes a wide collection of tools, such as a weather app, a timezone converter, a calendar.

Backup and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are.

Your emails will be safe thanks to built-in virus protection and spam blocking. Work with emails and attachments at any time on any device, and connect all your email accounts.\n\n• No frills. Unsubscribe from all unnecessary mailing lists at once by selecting them in the general address list. You don't have to open unwanted emails anymore to unsubscribe from the mailing list.\n• The app supports working with multiple email accounts at the same time, including Mail, Google, Outlook, Yahoo, Rambler, and iCloud. Read emails from different mailboxes in the same app.\n• All email attachments, including photos and documents, are automatically saved to the Yandex Disk cloud and are accessible from any device.\n• You can work with Yandex Mail without an internet connection. For example, if you lose your connection in the metro, you can still read emails and reply to them, and your messages will be sent automatically when you're back online.\n• Work with email on the go: see attachments, listen to an email if you're busy, and respond with a template message in one touch. Yandex Mail has a built-in translator for incoming and outgoing messages. You can read an email in a foreign language without any difficulties.\n• Protect yourself from hacking and spam. To prevent others from reading your emails, enable PIN code login. Yandex Mail smart algorithms reliably protect you from unwanted mailing lists.\n• Video meetings by link and Calendar. With Telemost, you can arrange work conferences and family chats. Make video calls on any device with no time restrictions. Organize calls directly in the Yandex Disk app without having to switch to Zoom, Skype, WhatsApp, or any other services. And if you add a meeting to Yandex Calendar, all participants will receive a reminder email.\n• An exclusive address.

Used by millions worldwide, our all-new email app protects your communications and has everything you need to easily manage your inbox.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says:\n“Proton Mail offers encrypted email, which makes it virtually impossible for anyone to read it except the sender and the recipient.”\n\nWith the all-new Proton Mail app, you can:\n• Create a @proton.me or @protonmail.com email address \n• Send and receive encrypted emails and attachments with ease\n• Switch between multiple Proton Mail accounts\n• Easily manage your email with conversations\n• Keep your inbox tidy and clean with folders, labels and simple swipe-gestures\n• Receive new email notifications\n• Send Password-protected Emails to anyone\n• Enjoy your inbox in dark mode\n\nWhy use Proton Mail?\n• Proton Mail is free — We believe everyone deserves privacy. Upgrade to a paid plan to get more done and support our mission. \n• Easy to use — Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to read, organize, and write your emails.\n• Your inbox is yours — We don’t spy on your communications to show you targeted ads. Your inbox, your rules.\n• Rigorous encryption — Your entire inbox is secured, on all your devices. No one can read your emails but you. Proton is privacy, guaranteed by end-to-end and zero-access encryption.\n• Unmatched protection — We offer strong phishing, spam, and spying/tracking protection for all your communications.\n\nIndustry Leading Security Features\nMessages are stored on Proton Mail servers using end-to-end encryption at all times and are transmitted securely between Proton servers and user devices. This largely eliminates the risk of message interception.\n\nZero Access to Your Email Content\nProton Mail's zero access architecture means that your data is encrypted in a way that makes it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side using an encryption key that Proton does not have access to. This means we don't have the technical ability to decrypt your messages.\n\nOpen-Source Cryptography\nProton Mail's open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security experts from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection. Proton Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP, while all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By using open-source libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption algorithms used do not have clandestinely built-in back doors.\n\nProton Mail in the press:\n“Proton Mail is a Gmail-like email system which uses end-to-end encryption, making it impossible for outside parties to monitor.” Forbes\n\n“A new email service being developed by a group who met at MIT and CERN promises to bring secure, encrypted email to the masses and keep sensitive information away from prying eyes.” Huffington Post\n\nFollow Proton on social media for all the latest news and offers:\nFacebook: /proton\nTwitter: @protonprivacy\nReddit: /protonmail\nInstagram: /protonprivacy\n\nFor more information, visit: https://proton.me/mail\nOur open-source code base: https://github.com/ProtonMail"

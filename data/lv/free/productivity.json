      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

No need to go to the mechanic for car maintenance!\n\nConnect an ELM 327 diagnostic interface to your car's ODB port (OBD 2) and run our OBD2 car diagnostics scanner app: you will be able to read the engine and transmission fault codes and view data from your vehicle in real time. The ODB 2 car scanner will be able to notify about problems related to the car's engine and transmission, like the gearbox, clutch, or other car parts related to the vehicle's torque.\n\nOur car scanner requires an ELM 327 OBD2 Bluetooth or WiFi adapter, like Veepeak or Vgate scan adapters. Also compatible with a klavkarr diagnostic car code reader.\n\n◉ WHAT OBD 2 CAR DIAGNOSTICS SCANNER BRINGS TO THE TABLE?\n\n√ View OBD 2 engine and transmission fault codes (also known as DTCs for Data Trouble Code) and see their meaning. E OBD11 Facile car scanner contains more than 15,000 definitions.\n\n√ Delete (or erase) OBD2 fault codes with an ELM 327 port.\n\n√ Clear the Malfunction Indicator Light (check engine light) on your car dashboard with our OBD 2 software.\n\n√ EOBD Facile displays manufacturer-specific OBDii error codes. They will bring you additional information for the following brands: BMW, Lexus, Ford, Jeep, Kia, Nissan, Audi, Subaru, Volvo, etc…\n\n√ Real-time display of car sensors and possibility of recording in a file. Depending on your vehicle's configuration you will be able to see: vehicle speed, engine rpm, engine temperature, ignition timing, engine torque, the amount of air intake, etc.\n\n√ Create records of your trips with E OBD Facile car diagnostic Windows / Macbook software.\n\n√ E OBD Facile OBD2 car diagnostic also lets you measure the acceleration performance of your car (0-100 km/h, standing start, etc.)\n\n◉ COMPATIBLE VEHICLES WITH OBD 2\n\nTo check whether your car is compatible with the E OBD2 / ODB2 standard, visit our website. We created, with the data provided by our community, a list of several thousand OBD11 compatible vehicles tested with our E OBD Facile car scanner software. This list is available for free on our website, which includes OBD2 BMW, OBD2 Audi, OBD 2 Nissan, ODB 2 Jeep, ODB Subaru and many others.\n\nIn general, all petrol vehicles produced since 2001 and diesel vehicles produced since 2004 are compatible with the E OBD Facile car scanner and ELM 327, whatever the brand.\n\nCan't find the location of your OBD 2 torque adapter? Download our App \"Where is my OBD2 port?\" Find it!\n\nThe connection with your smartphone can be done using either an ELM 327 OBD2 Bluetooth or WiFi. Our E OBD11 Facile car scanner functions with these 2 types of wireless connection.\n\nWarning: Lots of car scanners claiming to be ELM 327 compatible are sold on the internet under different names. But most of those scanners do not work properly. The connection problems with your car may come from these Chinese copies of ELM327 torque.\n\nFrom our app, you can test whether your ELM 327 has all the mandatory functionalities to provide you a quality OBDii diagnosis.\n\nIf the majority of the functions are not available during this test, it is because your ODB car scanner is defective. In this case, we invite you to contact the company which sells these ELM327: Kiwi 3, Viecar, Veepeak, Carista, LELink or Vgate scan adapter functions with our ODB2 car scanner app Torque.\n\nFor more information on our app and ODB2 car diagnostics scanner, please visit our website: outilsobdfacile.com\n\nDownload EOBD Facile and have access to the best ODB Car scanner, compatible with ELM 327 Bluetooth adapters.

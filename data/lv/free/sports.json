Player Cards have been immortalised by the EA Sports and the FIFA video game franchise, now, through the BALLN app, Player Cards are for everyone, not just the Pro’s.\n\nOur Player Card rating system has been adapted from the latest sports science research, building on research from some of the world's largest football talent identification studies which have tracked 100,000s of youth level players, and in doing so, developed tests that can accurately grade skill level across the skills that matter most.\n\nFor the very first time, you can get meaningful metrics on the fundamental skills needed to master your game day performance, as well as benchmark and compare your skills with other real players from all over the world.\n\nIMPROVEMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS\nThe BALLN app features over 350 training videos across all of the Player Card skills that are available to purchase as an in app subscription plan. These plans bring the best of sports and behavioural science research to you, to help you improve at the most optimal rate for your skill level. Your personalised training program is created based upon your rating and position -- knowledge that was previously available only to elite players.\n\nOur improvement programs go beyond the basic training and repetitive actions of programs of the past – they are formulated in collaboration with global experts in the field of sports and behavioural science and incorporate the very latest views on skill improvement efficiency.\n\nBREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGY\nAt the core of BALLN is an AI-based system for real-time computer vision. As video footage streams from your smartphone camera, the app tracks you and the ball position in 3 dimensions in real-time to provide your Player Card metrics. Our team of leading AI experts have optimized this system to run on your phone itself, removing the need for off-site processing on the field.\nAll you need to access the outdoor AI skills rating tests is a tall tripod or a friend to hold the phone. Invite them along to see who has the better rating and they can get their Player Card as well!\n\nGOT ANY QUESTIONS OR FEEDBACK?\nPlease shoot us an email at customercare@balln.ai.

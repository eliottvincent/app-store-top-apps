If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

The app helps organisers to distribute event related information to all the participants quickly and efficiently.\n\nParticipants can be divided into different categories so that they receive information only relevant to them. For example, Media will have its own category for their specific needs (media shuttle schedule, press center opening times etc). The organising committee will have its own information available through the app and teams all the information relevant for them. In addition to specific information, all users can have results, starting times etc available through the app.\n\nParticipants need to download the app and enter a password which will take them directly to the information according to their profile. The password will be made available from the organiser.\n\nThe organiser needs to contact Sportity Ltd for the use of the app."

Track your speed, the distance you have travelled, your current and upcoming altitudes, the calories you´ve burned. The SIGMA RIDE app gives you an overview of all of your training, shows you your statistics, and motivates you to pursue a fitter, healthier lifestyle. Share your experiences and successes with friends and family using your social networks.\n\n\nBe there live!\nRecord your bike data with your SIGMA bike computer and analyse them right away with the LIVE screen. Have the computer display your route and current GPS position to you on the map. Distance travelled, training time elapsed, and metres of altitude uphill are also displayed, including an altitude profile. You can set your individual training views easily while you're riding or use one of the preprogrammed views.\n\n\nE-Mobility\nYou ride an e-bike? No problem: the SIGMA RIDE app is e-bike-ready. Your battery level and e-bike assist modes can be displayed on your smartphone. They can also be shown as an easy-to-read heat map, which presents data in colour and offers a better overview.\n\n\nAn eye on everything\nLook at the precise details of every tour in the activity screen. Filter according to sport types and share your activities with your friends and the community via e-mail or on platforms such as Strava, komoot, Training Peaks, Facebook, and Twitter. Record your progress and see where you have improved. Ride data such as speed can be displayed as a heat map. Various coloured fields provide a quick overview of your performance and make it easy to detect outlying values. You can also record weather data and your subjective perception of the ride.\n\n\nOff to an adventure by using track navigation and the Search & Go function\nWith \"Search & Go Navigation\", you can quickly find any location and navigate there. To do this, you can either enter an address in the SIGMA RIDE app on your smartphone or click on any point on the map. Start the created track directly on your bike computer or save it in the SIGMA RIDE app.\nYou can also import tracks from the SIGMA DATA CENTER or from portals such as komoot and Strava via the SIGMA RIDE app. The selected track can be started immediately or it can be saved on the bike computer and cycled offline at a later time.\n\n\nAlways up-to-date: \nFirmware updates for your bike computer are easy with the SIGMA RIDE app, which informs you whenever a new update is available. Then simply follow the instructions on your phone.\n\n\nCompatible devices:\n- SIGMA ROX 11.1 EVO\n- SIGMA ROX 4.0\n- SIGMA ROX 2.0\n- VDO R4 GPS\n- VDO R5 GPS"

      "label": "Topscorers - This is THE Swiss Hockey Manager App of the National League! Compete against friends in your own league and collect live points with your favorite players on game days. In addition to the official game schedule, table and game center, the app offers more than 40 live statistics for all games of the championship. Download now and win the championship with your dream team!\n\n**General**\nIn the Topscorers app, users compete against each other in a league by putting together the most competitive ice hockey team possible from current National League professionals with a set budget. In each league, each hockey player exists only once. Before a game day, each user puts together his team from the players available to him. The sum of the points collected in real time for each player results in the total number of points for his team per game day. The users play to win the regular season (qualifier) and the playoffs (champion).\n\n**Live points**\nThe game principle of Topscorers is based on real events in the National League. On each National League game day you get points for the game actions of your lined up hockey players. These refer to the statistically recorded (live) performance data of the National League.\n\n**Create a league**\nCreate your own league and invite your friends against whom you want to play the season. In one league 1-14 users can play.\n\n**Game mode**\nAt the beginning of your Topscorers season you will be assigned a 20-player team worth CHF 3 million. The line-up is automatically generated from these 20 players and can be customized. In addition, you will receive a budget of CHF 1 million to make transfers. On the transfer market you can buy new players or sell players from your squad. But be careful, you must not have a negative account balance before the start of the game, otherwise you will not get any points for the whole game day.\n\nMail: help@topscorers.ch\nIG: @topscorers_official\nFB: @topscorersofficial\nTW: @TopscorersApp\nWeb: www.topscorers.ch\n\nThe use of the season subscription is subject to a fee. Each at CHF 5 per year. This subscription will be renewed for 1 additional year (at the time of subscription) if not cancelled. Monthly cancellation possible at any time according to Apple or Android guidelines. Payment is made exclusively via the App Store or via the Play Store via in-app purchase. The respective terms and conditions of the providers apply.\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttps://topscorers.ch/en/privacy-policy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttps://topscorers.ch/en/terms"

Are you ready to take your game to the next level?\n\nAn exclusive selection of the world’s top professional players has devoted themselves to the Checkbilliard system, in order to pass their knowledge, skills, and abilities on to you.\n\nThe Checkbilliard app is a completely new training concept, based on the world’s most successful billiard (training) system, the Playing Ability Test (PAT), developed by Ralph Eckert (Germany). Eckert, a billiard professional, national teams’ trainer, and author of several books, is currently responsible for the PAT system – the only billiard training method recommended by the World Pool Association (WPA) and also by the European Pocket Billiard Federation (EPBF). Checkbilliard GmbH is the legal successor to www.pat-billiard.com, and will organize all existing player and coach data, rankings, and test scores, into the new Checkbilliard system.\n\nDuring the three year development phase, the complete “old” approach has been revised and totally new tests, workouts and exercises have been developed. Where previously, the PAT evaluation system concluded with tests, now with the Checkbilliard system, the tests are only the beginning of an intensive new training method. In order to find out how this revolutionary new training system can help you, just download the app, and give it a try!\n\nWith Checkbilliard, we guarantee that you will improve your game, and with “ball in hand” you have the control to succeed!\n\nHave fun and success!\nYour Checkbilliard Crew"

      "label": "The APP of Dolomiti Superski is supposed to be a real online ski guide for those who want to discover the world’s largest ski carousel and is supported by all the operating systems of the most common smart phones. It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

      "label": "Checkbilliard represents a quantum leap in billiard training methodology.\nIt’s a tool, or actually, a “virtual billiards coach” which allows you to precisely determine your current strengths and weaknesses – and matches specific, personally generated exercises and practice routines so you can improve where you need it most.\n\nYou’ll need a Smartphone or a tablet, an internet connection (Wi-Fi when viewing the massive collection of HD instructional videos), a real pool table… and you’re good to go! Are you ready to take your game to the next level?\n\nAn exclusive selection of the world’s top professional players has devoted themselves to the Checkbilliard system, in order to pass their knowledge, skills, and abilities on to you.\n\nThe Checkbilliard app is a completely new training concept, based on the world’s most successful billiard (training) system, the Playing Ability Test (PAT), developed by Ralph Eckert (Germany). Eckert, a billiard professional, national teams’ trainer, and author of several books, is currently responsible for the PAT system – the only billiard training method recommended by the World Pool Association (WPA) and also by the European Pocket Billiard Federation (EPBF). Checkbilliard GmbH is the legal successor to www.pat-billiard.com, and will organize all existing player and coach data, rankings, and test scores, into the new Checkbilliard system.\n\nDuring the three year development phase, the complete “old” approach has been revised and totally new tests, workouts and exercises have been developed. Where previously, the PAT evaluation system concluded with tests, now with the Checkbilliard system, the tests are only the beginning of an intensive new training method. In order to find out how this revolutionary new training system can help you, just download the app, and give it a try!\n\nWith Checkbilliard, we guarantee that you will improve your game, and with “ball in hand” you have the control to succeed!\n\nHave fun and success!\nYour Checkbilliard Crew"

Recreational fishing in Sweden is subject the laws of the Swedish fisheries legislation and its associated regulations, and violation may lead to public prosecution.\n\nWith iFiskes app, you can find fishing areas by searching by name or looking at our map . The app helps you to buy your own fishing permit using your phone. For all the areas listed in the iFiske app, you can look at pictures from the area, read descriptions of the lake / river, review the fishing rules, see the presence of fish species, and much more! In other workds, this is the perfect tool to plan your fishing trip to Sweden.\n\nIn addition to buying permits and searching for fishing areas, you can also manage your purchased fishing licenses and review the rules that apply. The app content is available offline, eg when you have no mobile coverage, which comes handy if you are fishing in a remote area.\n\nThe app also contains detailed descriptions of the most common freshwater fishes in Sweden, and articles about common sport fishing methods. \n\nFor iFiske affiliated organizations there are in-app features for inspections of fishing permits and lists of all fishing licenses sold. Checks of permits can easily be done by scanning a QR code, or by entering the unique fishing card number. These features are only available to logged-in users that are connected to an organization that sells fishing licenses via iFiske.\n\nNOTE: If you are missing YOUR favorite fishing area in the app, please do not give the app a bad rating just because of that. We CAN only sell fishing licenses for those organisations that joined the iFiske service."

LapSnap is the first mobile app to connect your AiM device directly to your phone, without extra equipment. Just connect, download and analyze.\n\n- Visualize the lines and analyze each lap to see why you’ve been fast or slow in a particular part of the track. You can analyze speed, acceleration or deceleration, gas and brakes application, RPMs, gear change, lean angel for motorcycles, temperatures for Go-Karts, as well as your line on the map.\n\n- Compare your laps with your best lap, ultimate lap or with someone else’s lap to see what you can do to become faster.\n\n- Easy access to each session and each lap. This way you can always refer back to a particular lap.\n\n- Leaderboard. See how you stack up against others racers. Each track has a leaderboard.\n\n- Save your setup. Every session can contain your vehicle settings like suspension setup, gear ratio, tires you use etc. This way when you're coming back to a track, you can refer to the settings you've used the last time and you're not wasting valuable track time finding a setting that works.\n\n- Ultimate Lap. Your laps are divided into sectors. By taking best sectors of different laps we can put together an Ultimate lap. This way you can see what you are capable of if you get every part of you lap just right.\n\nTerms of use: https://lapsnap.app/terms.html\n\nThis service is not affiliated with, endorsed by or in any way associated with AiM Tech Srl or GoPro Inc. or their products and services.

      "label": "RunCline provides incline information entered manually in the app and transmits it automatically over Bluetooth. Alternatively, it can read incline directly from your smart treadmill. It will also connect to an external foot pod and/or heart rate monitor and re-transmit the collected metrics over Bluetooth. What's the purpose? You can pair the phone or tablet running RunCline with Zwift and get incline, power, speed, cadence and heart rate. RunCline will also display all metrics on screen for you to view during your running. What's even better? Some smart-er treadmills can also be controlled by RunCline to make them track incline from Zwift on PC or Mac. \n\nAs of version 1.6.7, RunCline can also pair with the Apple Watch to get heart rate and display some running metrics. The heart rate feature is using the HealthKit to transmit live heart rate values to RunCline and store them in Apple Health.\n\nRequirements: You need to pair a Bluetooth compliant foot pod and/or supported smart treadmill to RunCline to use the app. Otherwise, you can select the VirtualPod in the list of Foot Pods to use RunCline as a source of speed and incline for Swift.\n\nPairing screen:\n* Select one foot pod in range or smart treadmill (required)\n* Select one heart rate monitor in range (optional)\n* The \"Searching\" button will display \"Start\" once the foot pod device or smart treadmill is paired. If the Start button does not appear within 5 seconds, you may need to activate your foot pod by running or walking.\n\nRunCline screen. The running metrics from the foot pod, smart treadmill and/or heart rate monitor will be displayed on screen and re-transmitted to Zwift over Bluetooth. All running metrics are also saved to a .FIT file that can be emailed or exported after the run.\n\na) Select \"Live\" to display live metrics or \"10-second\" to get average metrics from the past 10 seconds.\nb) Use the + and - buttons to select the incline (if no smart treadmill connected).\nc) You can click the Volume Up and Down buttons on your phone or tablet to get spoken metric values.\n\nRuncline can be used to run outside. It will provide audio cues at every kilometer or mile. If you are running with power, it can provide audio cues to keep you within your power target. You can define workouts by pace, distance or power. RunCline will notify you at the beginning of each interval. Once your workout is completed, the log report includes detailed results of your run with a summary of all running metrics from your foot pod and more. \n\nList of supported foot pods:\n* Stryd\n* Zwift RunPod\n* MilestonePod\n* Runn from NPE\n* Garmin foot pods with >CABLE from NPE\n* Garmin watches like Fenix 6 with Virtual Run\n\nList of supported Smart Treadmills:\n* Bodycraft T1000\n* Bowflex BXT128, BXT116, BXT216\n* CareFitness Marathon 22\n* Decathlon Run, RoadRunner i/B, EZRun\n* Domyos-TC and Intense Run\n* FitnessFocus (i-Running)\n* FitShow\n* FlowFitness DTM2000, T3i\n* Horizon T202, Omega Z, 7.x AT, Paragon X\n* JTX Sprint 9 (i-Console)\n* Kettler S2, S4, S6, S8, S10\n* LifeFitness F3, T3 and T5 with Track Connect\n* NoblePro\n* NordicTrack C850S, C970 Pro, S20, S25, S30, T7, T10, Z1300i\n* Polar (i-Console)\n* Pro-Form 525i, 545i, 575i, 995i, Carbon XL, Pro 1500, Pro 2000, Sport 6.0\n* REEBOK GT50, GT60, SL8.0, Jet 300\n* SpiritFitness XT285, 385, 485, 685, CT800\n* Sole S77, F63, F65, F80, F85 and TT8\n* Taurus T10.3\n* Technogym MyRun\n* TrueFitness PS800\n* TRX3500\n* Tunturi T90\n* Woodway 4Front\n* XTERRA TRX3500, 4500\n* Treadmills with GEM Retro module\n\nFeedback is more than welcomed and will contribute to make RunCline better for everyone."

Our  Performance Test app uses this data to provide you with acceleration, deceleration and VMAX information for your vehicle previously only available to professional Racelogic VBOX users.\n \nYou can quickly and accurately measure your 0-60 acceleration time, turn your test track into a dragstrip and measure your 1/4 mile time and trap speed. Different modes allow you to measure your braking performance and zero to zero times, all using the same VBOX technology used by all the major motor manufacturers and car magazines around the world.\n\nAll of the apps functionality is available when you are connected via Bluetooth to an iOS device running iOS 7.0 or later.

      "label": "Sit-ups, raise your leg, hold up, Repeat the action, etc, maybe you've heard too many methods of abdominal exercises, always being your own coach. However, I still feel that I am not in good shape. That's because to pursue a sexy flat belly, your exercise requires some change and professional guidance. You need Abs workout: Six Pack in 30 Days to help you.\nThe abdomen is the part where the body fat accumulates most easily, and it is also the part that is more difficult to practice. Some people make hundreds of sit-ups every day, but the effect is not obvious. The reason is that the abdominal muscles are covered with a thick layer of fat. If the exercise method is not correct, only the muscles below the fat will be trained, but the fat will not be fully burned.\nAbs workout: Six Pack in 30 Days is a course specially designed for abdominal muscles to help bodybuilders lose abdominal fat in the easiest and most effective way to fully burn abdominal fat. No equipment needed, just train at home. We also set a calendar function to schedule your fitness plan every day and save your fitness data to track your fitness progress and calories burned. You can use the data to understand your daily exercise, and you can share it with your friends.\nAfter 30 days of exercise, you will find that the mermaid line and the vest line are not dreams!\n\nMain features of Abs workout: Six Pack in 30 Days：\n-Step counting data is from the HealthKit\n- Lose weight and get fit in a few minutes.\n- No equipment needed, self-weight to exercise at home.\n- Save performance history.\n- Regular reminders remind you to complete the exercise course of the day.\n- The Built-in calendar,  automatically marks your workout.\n- Customize your bodybuilding plan, choose your own course and generate a list of exercise courses.\n- Add favorite fitness classes to the list for your next workout.\n- Save and summarize data for each workout, track fitness progress and calories burned.\n- Your data is safe in your cellphone with you \n- Detailed animation guide.\n- Share with friends on social media.\n- Virtual Assistant lead you to workout\n- Elegant voice guide your workout \n\n\nContact the Abs workout: Six Pack in 30 Days：\nIf you have any questions about “Abs workout: Six Pack in 30 Days” or anything about fitness exercise, you can contact us（workout.feedback@valuepowered.com)We focus on fitness apps and we are constantly improving it.

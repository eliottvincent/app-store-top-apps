Lets coaches, swimmers or parents quickly:\n\n• lookup FINA points for a given time in a specific event\n• determine the time to swim for a given number of points in any event\n• save and sum up points for multiple performances\n\nAnd with the SwimX INSTANT UPDATE technology, times and points are always kept in sync making multiple look-ups a breeze. Just keep either points or time fixed and change event attributes like stroke, distance, pool length, or age group to instantly see the update with no extra ‘Go’ button.\n\nFeaturing:\n• Highly optimized interface for quick&easy one-hand use\n• Exchangeable base time sets and calculation formulas\n• Support for age group-specific calculations\n• A worksheet, persistent even when quitting the app\n• The most recent 2020/2021-season FINA data sets included\n• A bonus data set for the German team championships (DMS)\n• New data sets to be added as soon as they become available\n\nLet me know, if you need support for other conversion point tables and calculation formulas, for example, for kids. I’ll be happy to add them. And your feedback and suggestions are always very welcome, too!\n\nMarco\nmarco@smartstopwatch.com\n\nWeb: www.swimx.co\nFacebook: facebook.com/swimxpro (give SwimX a like, if you like!)\nTwitter: @swimxpro\nSupport: swimx@smartstopwatch.com"

      "label": "SPRT MTRX is a FREE, easy to use and fun game where you bid on the outcome of NBA, NHL and NFL games. Cash prizes are awarded to the player who receives the most points for winning games.\n \nThe events are organized as “Challenges” and cover multiple games Daily. Example: The Sunday NFL Challenge involves bidding on the scores of all of the NFL games played on Sunday.\n \nIt’s EASY:\n1. Pick your sport – “NBA” “NHL” or \"NFL\".\n2. Pick your challenge – “Win it All NBA Challenge” or \"Sunday NFL Challenge\".\n3. Bid on each of the games included in the Challenge.\n4. Wait until shortly before the first game of the Challenge starts to check your winning bids.[A1] \n5. Follow the live score feed, updates and stats of each game to see how your winning bids fare.\n6. Cheer on your team and hope the games finish on your winning scores.\n \nYou may ask yourself - How do I bid?\n \nEach NBA, NHL or NFL game is presented as a 7 by 7 grid of squares, modeled after the classic Super Bowl game, Squares. All of the possible outcomes of the game are available for you to bid on.\n \nSPRT MTRX provides you with a token of 10$M for each game. This is NOT real money! You don’t ever have to pay ANYTHING! You bid this imaginary 10$M however you like on the grid. The more likely scores, like a 4 - 3 square, require higher bids. However, a less likely score, such as a 1 - 0 or 8 - 0 will be cheaper. Spread your bids around evenly or focus on a few likely scores.\n \nRemember: You are bidding against between 4 and 7 other players for your desired scores. The highest bidder on each square will win that score. So, if you’re the highest bidder on the winning score’s square, you win the game!\n \nBefore each game starts, you will be able to see which squares you’ve won and which scores you need in order to win the point for that game. During the Challenge, you can follow the live Leaderboard to see where you stand in the rankings and know how many more games you need to win to claim the prize. The player that wins the most points for winning the correct scores of each game of the Challenge wins the prize.\n \nWhen you have some skin in the game, it’s more fun to watch. You can’t win if you never play. Hey, you never know!\n \nSPRT MTRX FEATURES:\n \nPlay Against the Community:\n- Choose challenges for the NFL and NBA games of that week - then bid on scores you think will win\n- Use an imaginary 10$M to bid on squares in a 7x7 grid\n- Make all your picks then watch the results - whoever wins the most games wins a REAL cash prize!\n- Cash prizes range from $200, $400, $500, $800, $1000 or $1200.\n \nPlay Against Friends:\n- Create a private challenge and invite friends to play - bid on NFL, NHL and NBA games\n- Choose the squares with the scores you think will win\n- The person who wins the most games wins epic bragging rights!\n \nTrivia:\n- Play trivia on a 4x4 grid\n- Players get 3 chances to answer correctly, with score being based on speedy answers\n- Trivia includes questions like “match up the nickname to the correct team”\n- Do you have the knowledge required?\n \nBid on the Grid!"

      "label": "The APP of Dolomiti Superski is supposed to be a real online ski guide for those who want to discover the world’s largest ski carousel and is supported by all the operating systems of the most common smart phones. It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

Player Cards have been immortalised by the EA Sports and the FIFA video game franchise, now, through the BALLN app, Player Cards are for everyone, not just the Pro’s.\n\nOur Player Card rating system has been adapted from the latest sports science research, building on research from some of the world's largest football talent identification studies which have tracked 100,000s of youth level players, and in doing so, developed tests that can accurately grade skill level across the skills that matter most.\n\nFor the very first time, you can get meaningful metrics on the fundamental skills needed to master your game day performance, as well as benchmark and compare your skills with other real players from all over the world.\n\nIMPROVEMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS\nThe BALLN app features over 350 training videos across all of the Player Card skills that are available to purchase as an in app subscription plan. These plans bring the best of sports and behavioural science research to you, to help you improve at the most optimal rate for your skill level. Your personalised training program is created based upon your rating and position -- knowledge that was previously available only to elite players.\n\nOur improvement programs go beyond the basic training and repetitive actions of programs of the past – they are formulated in collaboration with global experts in the field of sports and behavioural science and incorporate the very latest views on skill improvement efficiency.\n\nBREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGY\nAt the core of BALLN is an AI-based system for real-time computer vision. As video footage streams from your smartphone camera, the app tracks you and the ball position in 3 dimensions in real-time to provide your Player Card metrics. Our team of leading AI experts have optimized this system to run on your phone itself, removing the need for off-site processing on the field.\nAll you need to access the outdoor AI skills rating tests is a tall tripod or a friend to hold the phone. Invite them along to see who has the better rating and they can get their Player Card as well!\n\nGOT ANY QUESTIONS OR FEEDBACK?\nPlease shoot us an email at customercare@balln.ai.

Services are provided as-is, and are subject to change or discontinuation at any time. This functionality does have privacy implications. Please see this app's online documentation and http://Live.RaceRender.com before enabling its use. Use of Live Streaming service requires an Internet connection, and is therefore subject to your wireless carrier and/or Internet provider's data rates.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases.

      "label": "Every meter counts\n\nNowhere in the world is climate and agriculture more tightly bound than in Africa. But for the largest group of subsistence farmers, there is no weather data.\n\nThe Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory (TAHMO) aims change that. The program seeks to build a dense network of 20,000 weather stations across Africa — one for every 30 km. By monitoring the weather, TAHMO stations give farmers the data they need to make better crop decisions. But we need your help.\n\nJoin Team TAHMO\n\nThe TAHMO crowdfunding app allows anyone to get involved.  For every kilometer you run or cycle, METER will donate funds to support weather stations in Africa.\n\nJust set up a free account! Funding raised will be used to instrument sites across the continent.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

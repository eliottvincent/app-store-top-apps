      "label": "“Rīgas satiksme” mobilā lietotne ir radīta, lai padarītu sabiedriskā transporta biļešu iegādi ērtāku un pieejamāku. Lietotne ir paredzēta koda biļešu iegādei tiešsaistes režīmā un izmantošanai tramvajos, trolejbusos un autobusos. Iekāpjot transporta līdzeklī, tālrunī iegādātā biļete jāaktivizē, skenējot kvadrātkodu, kas izvietots vairākās vietās pa visu transporta līdzekļa salonu, vai jāievada identifikācijas numurs, kas ir redzams zem kvadrātkoda. Katram transporta līdzeklim ir atšķirīgs kvadrātkods un identifikācijas numurs. Gadījumā, ja transportā iekāpj kontrolieris, jāatver lietotne un jāuzrāda reģistrētā biļete kontrolierim. Lietotnē var nopirkt līdz 10 viena brauciena biļetēm par pilnu braukšanas maksu. Biļetes jāizmanto trīs mēnešu laikā no iegādes brīža. Lai iegādātos brauciena biļetes, tālrunim nepieciešams interneta pieslēgums.\r\nMums ir svarīgs Jūsu viedoklis! Lai varētu pilnveidot sistēmu un pēc iespējas pielāgot to klientu vajadzībām, aicinām dalīties savā lietotnes lietošanas pieredzē mūsu tīmekļa vietnē www.rigassatiksme.lv sadaļā “Sazinies ar mums”. Vairāk patīkamu braucienu!"

The user does not have to go to the company’s office to sign a contract, take the car keys and return them later at an agreed place. Our clients can take the vehicle exactly in the time when they actually need to and use it as long as they want to, and leave it wherever it is convenient for them.\nAnd finally, our clients can rent a car for a short period of time — even for 5 minutes! After all, if a client needs a car only for a short period, then why would he overpay for the time when he is not using it?\nEventually, CARGURU is something more than just car rental.

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

To address climate change and make cities greener and more livable, we want to revolutionize urban transportation by creating a future that uses carbon dioxide-free electric carpooling vehicles. Electric and shared microcirculation is one of the most sustainable forms of commuting, with the potential to replace all short car trips.\n\n\nTRAVEL RESPONSIBLY\nA protected community begins with a responsible method of displacement. It is important to remember the rules of the road before each trip. You should always:\n• Circulate on the bike lanes or, failing that, on the road. Never drive on the sidewalks\n• Putting on a helmet is more than recommended. Prevention is better than cure!\n• Park without blocking pedestrian paths, driveways and access ramps\n\n\nVisit https://www.pegaso.pro/ for more information.\n\n\nCheck the Pegaso application for more details on the services and vehicles offered in your city."

For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

      "label": "Thousands of self-guided walking tours and travel articles in 1,000+ cities around the world are included in this handy app. No need to hop on a tour bus or join a tour group; now you can explore all the city attractions on your own, at your own pace, and at a cost that is only a fraction of what you would normally pay for a guided tour.\n\nThe app is designed to be used offline so No Data Plan or Internet is Needed, and No Roaming either.\n\nThe app is free to download. Afterwards, you can evaluate the walking tours - see the attractions and use the fully functional offline maps included in each of the city walk guides, all for free. A small payment – fraction of what you would normally pay for a guided group tour or tour bus tickets – is needed for accessing the walk route maps and activating turn-by-turn navigation functions.\n\nThe highlights and features of the FREE app include:\n* Thousands of self-guided walking tours that show you what to see in the destination.\n* Thousands of travel articles make planning a trip really easy.\n* Offline city maps.\n* The \"FindMe\" feature displaying your exact location on the map.\n* The \"TrackMe\" feature tracks your steps so you know where you have been.\n\nAfter upgrade, you have access to the following advanced features:\n* Walking tour maps.\n* Voice guided turn-by-turn travel directions.\n* Create your own walks to see the attractions you like.\n* No advertisement.\n\nThis app supports subscription which allows you to access all the walking tours and articles in this app at one low price.\n\nHow The Annual Subscription Works:\n* Option 1. For $12.99 you will get access to the full version functions in all the 480 city walks guides (London, Rome, Paris, Tokyo, etc.) included in this app for one year. Travel articles are not included in this subscription.\n* Option 2. For $12.99, you will get access to the full version functions in all the travel articles in 900+ cities worldwide (London, Rome, Paris, Tokyo, etc.) included in this app for one year. City walks guides are not included in this subscription.\n* Option 3. For $18.99, you will get access to the full version functions in all the 480 city walking guides plus travel articles in over 900 cities for one year. Together they cover over 1,000 cities worldwide\n* A 3-day Free Trial is provided under each subscription upgrade offer. Your account will not be charged anything as long as you cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the end of the Free Trial.\n* Your annual subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renewal is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at the confirmation of the subscription purchase or after the Free Trial has completed.\n* You may turn off the auto-renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings.\n\nTerms of Use:\nhttps://www.gpsmycity.com/terms.html\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.gpsmycity.com/privacy-policy.html\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. This app gives you the option to turn off the GPS tracking in the background to prolong the battery life. It is also suggested that you bring with you an external battery.\n\nNote: This app relies on GPS for its navigation functions. For best experience, it is recommended to use the app on iPhone and iPad cellular+wifi models. It is not recommended to use the app on iPad WiFi-only models due to lack of built-in GPS support in these models.\n\nTutorial videos for using this app can be found on our website at www.gpsmycity.com/mobile-app.html"

There simply is no better way to see a city on foot, at your own pace and at a cost that is only a fraction of what you would normally pay for a guided tour.\n\nThis app comes with a detailed and fully functional city map to help you explore the city and locate the sights of interest. City map functions included in this app are: street name and business (restaurants, cafes, etc.), search, location bookmarking, `Findme` (iPhone and iPad 3/4G model), movement tracking (iPhone and iPad 3/4G model), and more. You can track your steps, take photos along the way, and then share your tracks and photos with friends.\n\nSightseeing walks included in this application are:\n\n* Museum Island Tour (7 sights)\n* Mitte Orientation Walk (13 sights)\n* Mitte/Tiergarten Museums (7 sights)\n* Religious Sights of Berlin (7 sights)\n* Third Reich Berlin Tour (5 sights)\n* Berlin for Kids Tour (5 sights)\n* Mitte Governmental Sites (10 sights)\n* Scheuenviertel Walking Tour (10 sights)\n* Tiergarten Walk (11 sights)\n* Souvenir Shopping P1 (6 sights)\n* Souvenir Shopping P2 (6 sights)\n* Kreuzberg & Mitte Nightlife (9 sights)\n* Berlin Nightlife (7 sights)\n\nDiscovery walks included in this application are:\n\n* Kurfürstendamm and Tauentzienstrasse Shopping\n* Mitte Shopping\n* Nikolaiviertel Walking Tour\n* West Kreuzberg Walking Tour\n* East Kreuzberg Walking Tour\n* Neukölln Walking Tour\n\nNo Data Plan or Internet is Needed, and No Roaming either. All the data used in this app is built into the software, so there is no need for internet access or cellular data plan. No need to pay costly roaming charges when traveling to foreign cities. The app works with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.\n\nAll the navigation features related to the city walks are disabled in this Lite version, which means that you can view the walk details (sight descriptions and photos), but NO navigation assistance is provided to guide you from one sight to the next. Download the Lite version if you want to use the city map or learn about the city walks. However, if you want to join the walks, it is highly recommended that you download a Full Version of this app. The Full Version includes detailed walk route maps to guide you from one sight to the next.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.GPSmyCity.com to find city walks for over 470 cities worldwide.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

      "label": "Lose Yourself Without Getting Lost.\n\nThis handy application presents you several self-guided walks featuring the best of the city, from world famous attractions to hidden gems. There simply is no better way to see a city on foot, at your own pace and at a cost that is only a fraction of what you would normally pay for a guided tour.\n\nThis app comes with a detailed and fully functional city map to help you explore the city and locate the sights of interest. City map functions included in this app are: street name and business (restaurants, cafes, etc.), search, location bookmarking, `Findme` (iPhone and iPad 3/4G model), movement tracking (iPhone and iPad 3/4G model), and more. You can track your steps, take photos along the way, and then share your tracks and photos with friends.\n\nSightseeing walks included in this application are:\n\n* Walk Around the Acropolis (8 sights)\n* Plaka Attractions (11 sights)\n* The National Garden Tour (11 sights)\n* City Orientation Walk (15 sights)\n* Vassilissis Sofias Avenue (7 sights)\n* Athens for Children Tour (5 sights)\n* Walk in Exarcheia District (11 sights)\n* Exploring Ancient Athens (14 sights)\n* Athenian Museums Tour (6 sights)\n* Monastiraki Gift Shops (9 sights)\n* Souvenir Shopping (7 sights)\n* City Center Nightlife (8 sights)\n\nDiscovery walks included in this application are:\n\n* Plaka and Anafiotika Walking Tour\n* Monastiraki and Kolonaki Shopping\n* A Walk in Controversial Exarcheia District\n\nNo Data Plan or Internet is Needed, and No Roaming either. All the data used in this app is built into the software, so there is no need for internet access or cellular data plan. No need to pay costly roaming charges when traveling to foreign cities. The app works with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.\n\nAll the navigation features related to the city walks are disabled in this Lite version, which means that you can view the walk details (sight descriptions and photos), but NO navigation assistance is provided to guide you from one sight to the next. Download the Lite version if you want to use the city map or learn about the city walks. However, if you want to join the walks, it is highly recommended that you download a Full Version of this app. The Full Version includes detailed walk route maps to guide you from one sight to the next.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.GPSmyCity.com to find city walks for over 470 cities worldwide.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. This app gives you the option to turn off the GPS tracking in the background to prolong the battery life."

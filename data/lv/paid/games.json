Если нет - не тратьте зря время, скорее всего Вы не сможете отличить наше приложение от множества некачественных подделок, давно существующих в App Store. Это приложение создано для истинных ценителей игр \"Электроника\". По специально разработанной технологии, мы изучили устройство четырехбитного микропроцессора КБ1013ВК1-2, который является основой, «сердцем» всех игр Электроника, и полностью реализовали алгоритм его работы в данном приложении. Таким образом, мы оставили далеко позади всех наших конкурентов с их многочисленными неправдоподобными версиями этой игры.\n\nРечь не идет о точной копии. Впервые перед вами… Оригинал! Или, если хотите, клон. Точный клон. Perfect Clone! Мы даже не записывали никаких звуков реальной игры, их воспроизводит оригинальная программа из микропроцессора, без нашего участия! Соблюдены все тайминги и режимы игры! Вы не найдете ни одного отличия в работе между этой игрой и оригиналом. И это не удивительно, ведь наша игра управляется тем же самым алгоритмом, что и настоящая \"Ну, Погоди!\" Не верите - проверьте сами. Если найдете отличия, мы вернем вам деньги!\n\nМы также изучили поведение и реакцию жидко-кристаллического индикатора оригинальной игры в зависимости от уровня заряда батареек, и реализовали в игре возможность симуляции разряженных элементов питания! Максимум реализма, играйте, как на настоящей игре из вашего детства!\n\nТеперь любимая игра «Ну, Погоди!» снова с Вами - больше не потеряется и не сломается никогда!\n\nОСОБЕННОСТИ ИГРЫ:\n\n● Первый в мире оцифрованный прототип советской игры «Ну, Погоди! Электроника ИМ-02»;\n● Исследована система команд микропроцессора игры, полностью реализован алгоритм его работы;\n● Изучена электрическая схема игры, в точности реализованы клавиши управления;\n● Изучен и реализован жидко-кристаллический индикатор (дисплей) игры;\n● Имеется возможность выбора типа фильтра ЖКИ дисплея из трех возможных: \n\t1) Аналоговый - максимально приближенный к реальному, \n\t2) Цифровой - с моментальной реакцией дисплея, \n\t3) без фильтра - в этом режиме на экране игры можно увидеть так называемый «мусор», появляющийся в момент, когда микропроцессор игры обновляет содержимое дисплея.\n●●● Возможность включить бессмертный режим игры, предусмотренный разработчиками игры \"Ну, Погоди!\", но никому прежде неизвестный, так как его активация на настоящей игрушке требует замыкания определенных выводов микропроцессора (мы раскрыли и этот секрет!);\n\n● В игре имеется меню с настройками, для входа в него коснитесь логотипа игры в верхнем левом углу;\n● Можно изменять цвет корпуса игры и кнопок;\n● Можно симулировать различный уровень заряда батареек игры, как в реальности;\n● Возможность выбрать в качестве звукового источника другой порт процессора и услышать совсем другие звуки, которые вы никогда прежде не слышали - их выдает реальная микросхема игры \"Ну, Погоди\"!\n● Функции сброса, установки времени и будильника, как в оригинале;\n● Функция автоматической синхронизации часов вашего iPhone или iPad с часами в игре;\n● Можно видеть работу микропроцессора игры, наблюдая в реальном времени значения его регистров и содержание 65 ячеек его памяти;\n● Интеграция с Game Center - делитесь вашими лучшими результатами с друзьями!\n● Предназначено как для iPhone, так и для iPad;\n● На iPad можно перемещать игру по экрану, перетаскивая пальцем дисплей игры вверх/вниз;\n● На iPad можно играть как в альбомной, так и в портретной ориентации устройства;\n● Поддержка графики высокого разрешения для всех моделей iPhone, включая iPhone X/Xs/Xs Max;\n● Совместимо с iOS 9 и выше."

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

Every game round involves two players, but if you have more people you can break into teams and change team every round.\n\n2. The First Player secretly records a short fragment of a song a capella while the Second Player is not listening.\n\n3. The Second Player listens to the recorded a cappella in reverse and tries to guess the song at once.\n\n4. If the Second Player can’t guess it, then he tries to repeat the reversed version by recording it fragment by fragment.\n\n5. When all fragments are recorded, Second Player listens to them all together reversed back and makes his final guess! If he has repeated fragment close enough he should hear the original song. Or something very similar!\n\nCheck out http://inreverse.me to watch a demo video and to leave your feedback. Share your tips and game rules variations with everyone!"

      "label": "This is a simulator to help you learn to fly, or practice flying an FPV race-style quadcopter in FPV.  With that said, you can also fly in LOS and fly a plane instead of a quad!\n\nThe main thing to note about this simulator is that it's not about racing.  Whilst there are some basic gates set up to go through, this is more focused towards freestyle flying, and flying for fun.\n\nTo that end, we've included aspects such as being able to chase other vehicles: You can chase up to 3 cars at once going around various circuits on over the different levels and try chasing a plane to help you find ways you might capture this kind of footage in real life.\n\nIn the levels you'll find mountains to proximity fly, trees to weave through, a partly constructed office block to fly through (but watch out for the nearby moving crane), moving wind turbines, balls to hit, and not to mention a city with densely packed buildings to fly through.\n\nTo give an added sense of realism, weather effects, and time of day are supported - so fly at night, fly in a thunderstorm - whatever you like.\n\nOnline play is also supported with up to 4 players per room where you can mix and match planes and quads and also have full crossplay with other mobile devices and those on the desktop versions.\n\nLastly, there is Quad Ball, a fully-featured game within the sim!  In Quad Ball you have to use your quadcopter to get the ball to the goal... ram the ball in just the right way to reach the goal, but be careful, overcook your hit and the ball might fall out of play.\n\nSupport for touch controls and bluetooth controllers such as the Playstion and Xbox gamepads  Touch controls work well for gentle flying, but for really fast acrobatic flight, using an external controller is highly recommended.\n\nFull setup for your quad (or plane) is provided so you can set things up as gentle or aggressive as you like.  Some pre-defined rates are also supplied if you want to simplify things.\n\nInstructions on how to operate the sim are included within the app, but more verbose documentation can be found here https://www.currykitten.co.uk/currykitten-fpv-sim-mobile-edition/\n\nThis app is still under development, and thus more features and levels are expected in the future.\n\nThe sim should run well on most reasonably up-to-date iPhones to iPads (it was extensively tested using an iPhone XR) but is graphically intensive so older devices may struggle.  It's possible to alter the graphic detail in-game to help with this though."

      "label": "\"If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you.\" - , 9/10, Pocket Gamer UK\n\n\"This War of Mine isn’t exactly “fun,” but it’s definitely a game worth playing.\" , 9/10, 148apps\n\n\"I'm really excited to go home and download 11 bit studios' title on my iPad\" , Game Informer\n\nIn This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n\nThis War of Mine: Anniversary Edition\nIt's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? \n\nKey Features:\n• Inspired by real-life events \n• Control your survivors and manage your shelter \n• Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive \n• Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience \n• Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game \n• Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\n\nThis War of Mine experience is now broadened with \"The Little Ones\" expansion. \"The Little Ones\" explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.\n\n• Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine\n• Protect innocent children\n• Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need\n• Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is optimized for latest devices. While playing on older devices such as iPhone 4s or iPad 2 you might experience lower frame rates."

Be careful though: leading has never been easy and it will be even more challenging in a similar world. Something mysterious has thrown the whole future humanity in a deep confusion, causing a continuous stream of events as wars, illness, famine. No one seems to recall what started this all, no one seems to know anything about the odd events that keeps involving the planet, no one can explain why you seem to rise every time someone tries to keep you down.\n\nSo be careful, and think long and hard each and every decision, because nothing happens by chance. Every single event might help you reach your final victory, but at the same time it could be the reason of your failure. Who will be your friend, and who will be your enemy? Hard to say in such a complex world filled with betrayals, aliens, bionic beings and ancient myths. What’s done is done, and you can just play your cards as well as you can in this inevitable race against time."

Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dire future.\n\nAs the overwhelming despair of this new world surrounds you, how will you survive? Your approach to the countless moral choices you’ll be faced with on a daily basis, could be the difference between the lives of your family or their unfortunate end. Resources are scarce though, with barely enough to cling desperately to life for another day you’re already faced with a monumental choice. Who will you send to venture out into the vast unforgiving wasteland? Whilst exploration is a traumatic experience, the weapons you can craft from resources could tip the scales of life or death in your favour. Assaults from feral beasts and roaming factions are endlessly closing in, imminent and deadly risks surround you.\n ‘Violence is never the answer’… Maybe you once believed that, but combat may now be your only option for survival. As you and your family grow and progress, so do their skills, attributes and weaknesses. Ensure that they’re well equipped as you strategize, securing victory against those who threaten the survival of your family in tense turn based combat."

Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realise your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free!

It is a metaphorical game filled with illusions and hidden messages.\n\nIn the world of OVIVO, Black and White exist in harmony. By constantly intertwining and replacing each other, they maintain balance. The main character named OVO was born of these two halves and has the ability to switch between them. OVO travels through the metaphorical world, overcoming dangers and collecting mysterious symbols. These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.\n\nFeatures:\n■\tFlow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black—upward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being carried by a flow.\n\n■\tFascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions.\n\n■\tDesign without words. There is almost no text in the game and the story is told through gameplay and visuals.\n\n■\tMeditative ambient soundtrack by Brokenkites."

Don’t get burned and jump between walls to collect coins and medallions. Break stone blocks and activate platforms before you fall into fog and much more...\n\nA RUNNING ADVENTURE\n\nManuganu is a 3D side-scroller running game, in which you control the boy “Manuganu”.\nUnlike other usual running games, Manuganu brings on the “Halt feature” to avoid swinging rocks, hammers, flames and other enemies with the right timing. Another important feature of Manuganu is the ability to switch from “running” mode to “rope climbing” mode when needed. But be careful! This mode has its own challenges.\n\nGAME FEATURES\n\n•Platforming Actions: Double Jumping, Wall Sliding, Hovering, Wall Jumping, Rolling, Breaking Stone Blocks\n•Run through 30 different levels, each with it’s own unique design according to the level theme.\n•Two button controls and specific swipe controls.\n•Run into alternate paths to get 3 Star in all Levels.\n•Three different environments with full 3D graphics.\n•Original Soundtrack by Tolga YURDABAK\n•Turkish-English Language Support"

If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\r\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\r\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\r\n\r\nWe will update and improve Real Drift constantly. Please rate and give your feedback for further improvement of the game.\r\nFOLLOW US\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Real-Drift/788082697884714"

Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

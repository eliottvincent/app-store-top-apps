Realms is a monthly subscription service that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you won't be refunded for the remaining active period of the subscription.\n\nHere are links to our privacy policy and terms of use:\n- Privacy policy: https://account.mojang.com/terms#privacy\n- Terms of use: https://account.mojang.com/terms"

      "label": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

Thank god who brought me an angel like you at that time.\n\n《Wenjia》is our first standalone game,  hope you like this game~~:) we will also try to improve it constantly,if you encounter difficulties or bugs in the game, welcome to contact us~~\nfacebook:DilemmaStudio\nEmail:info@dilemma-studio.com\n\nprize：\n*2018 FGF CHINA：Golden Handle\n*2018indieplay：Best Game（candidate）\n*2018indieplay：Best Music（candidate）\n*2018indieplay： Best Art（candidate）\n*Tencent Game Awards:Best Game\n*2017 GDC IGF \nXbox Exclusive Game\n\n\n《Wenjia》 is a 2D platform game with puzzle-solving elements. Players can freely travel between two realms (the material world and the energy world), each of them with different challenges and obstacles. Players must utilize both realms’mechanisms to reach their final goal.\n\n\n【The world of WENJIA is one that shifts between the realms of Matter and Energy】\nThe realms of Matter and Energy mirror each other in perfect duality. However, certain entities in the Energy Realm have evolved into matter-less sentient beings. The game’s kitten protagonist (a cat-shaped energy entity) and spirits are all examples of such beings. Pure energy entities can travel freely between the two realms.\n\n【The story of WENJIA thus unfolds】\nA forest’s longstanding tranquility is shattered by a sudden earthquake. As lava bursts forth from the ground, the mountain’s spirits find themselves surrounded by fiery death. By controlling a kitten, the player must overcome numerous obstacles in the wild to reach the burning heart of the mountain and rescue the spirits before it’s too late.\n\n【Cross-Realm Travels】\nWENJIA is a 2D platform game with puzzle-solving elements. Players can freely travel between two realms, each of them with different challenges and obstacles. Players must utilize both realms’ mechanisms to reach their final goal.\n\n【Soothing In-game Environment】\nWENJIA’s exquisite hand-drawn graphics bring out both the vivid colorfulness of the Matter Realm and the fantastical strangeness of the Energy Realm. The sharp contrast between the two realms offers the players a unique visual feast.\nWorking with game audio talents from Russia, WENJIA’s sound team has created an immersive fantasy environment that features deep woods, eerie ruins, and raging volcanos."

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

He suddenly loses consciousness and comes to in what appears to be the interior of the academy.\nThe dreary mood is far from the impression given by the name \"Hope's Peak Academy.\" The dingy corridors, iron-barred windows, and prison-like atmosphere... Something is wrong.\n\nIn the entrance hall, a stuffed bear that claims to be the headmaster tells the students they will live in the confines of the school until the day they die, and they must kill someone if they want to leave.\n\nIncluding Makoto, there are 15 Ultimate Students from all over the world trapped in this academy of despair.\nOne thing after another crushes their hope. Incidents which shake their trust, the sadistic headmaster, and the mystery of the mastermind. Who is behind it all, and what do they want?\n\nThe battle with an unseen enemy begins...\n\n\n■ Game Features\n\n・High Speed Deductive Action\nDetermine the truth of each incident with testimony and proof gathered during your investigation. Use what you've learned in high-speed Class Trials to shoot down the opponent's statements.\n\n・2.5D Motion Graphics\nA distinctly crafted environment that's planar yet stereoscopic is born by combining 2D illustrations of characters and objects in a 3D environment.\nThese new, 2.5D motion graphics were developed by using unique motion techniques and camera work.\n\n・Completely Optimized for Smartphone Controls\nThe 3D map movement controls and UI have been revamped!\nThe map jumping function has been improved along with various other adjustments, making gameplay even smoother than before.\n\n\n■ Additional Contents\n\n・Intimacy Gallery\nIntimacy Events have been compiled in gallery form!\nReplay your favorite characters and events whenever you want, as many times as you want.\n\n・Character Gallery\nAllows players to view character sprites and lines in a gallery.\nIf you ever get the urge to hear that one line, now you can!\n\n・Ultimate Gallery\nA gallery full of promotional illustrations and character sheets from the official art book.\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n[Supported OS]\r\niOS 11.0 and above.\r\n*Not supported on certain devices.\r\n\r\n[Supported Languages]\r\nText: English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese\r\nAudio: English, Japanese"

These numbers indicate the SUM of cells sandwiched between the 1 and the 9 in that row/column. The logic required to solve the puzzles will appeal to anyone who enjoys normal Sudoku and a bit of basic maths. Each puzzle here has been lovingly hand-crafted by Mark Goodliffe and Simon Anthony, the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic. They've even included their own hints on each puzzle to help if you get stuck. Mark and Simon have both represented the UK many times in the World Sudoku Championship.\n\n“I love it!”\nAlex Bellos, author of Alex's Adventures in Numberland\n\nFeatures:\n100 hand-crafted levels\nMany themes to choose from\nHints written by Mark and Simon!"

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

      "label": "New version of the multi-awarded board game. Now in 3D. Includes improved AI, 3D landscape, new exclusive features.\n\n*** Carcassonne fits that opening game niche that every game group needs. -Tyler Nichols, Board Game Quest\n*** Carcassonne = Great game, great mechanics, great pieces, great fun! -The Board Game Family\n\nA TILE PLACEMENT GAME OF CREATING LANDSCAPES, CLAIMING AREAS, AND GAINING POINTS\nDiscover or re-discover Carcassonne, the multi-awarded tile-based game in which players draw and place their tiles to build a medieval city. Place your cities, roads, abbeys or fields to enlarge your landscape, then place your followers, the meeples. Knights, robbers or farmers... Each meeple will help you control your territory and win points.\nBut be careful, you will need all your best strategy and tactics to maximum your points! Place your tiles and your meeples wisely to stop your opponents and win the game.\n\n6 EXPANSIONS: ENLARGE YOUR LANDSCAPE AND OPTIMIZE YOUR POINTS\nThanks to the mini expansions \"\"The River\"\" and \"\"The Abbot\"\", you can embellish your landscape and vary your game to enjoy new ways to play! Double or even triple your points thanks to the new buildings in the Inns & Cathedrals expansion! And with the Traders & Builders expansion, score more points with the trading commodities and build faster with the builders! Discover the city of Carcassonne covered with a blanket of white snow in the Winter Edition... and look out for the Gingerbread Man and the bonus points he'll give you! Beware of the Dragon in \"\"the Princess and the Dragon\"\" expansion! He could eat your Meeples if you're not cautious. And be kind with the Princess: she might prefer you to other Meeples and toss them out of the cities!\n\nFEATURES\n• Accessible and tactical gameplay adapted from the award-winning Carcassonne board game    \n• 6 expansions:\n- The River, the Inns & Cathedrals, the Traders & Builders, the Winter Edition and Princess & Dragon are all available to purchase from the Game Shop.\n- Unlock The Abbot for free using your Asmodee account.\n• Up to 6 players! Play against the computer in solo mode, face off your friends in Pass and Play or challenge players from around the world in online mode\n• There is no more 3 but 4 different behaviors you can chose before starting a game with AIs. They all propose a better challenge than the previous ones. Players who want to experiment a true challenge will play against the Conqueror AI who is the strongest AI of the game.\n• Try out the aerial top view to refine your strategy!\n• Additional strategic layers compared to the physical version:\n- field view which allows you to see the field possession of each player\n- remaining tile list: allows you to see the tiles which are remaining in the draw pile\n\nLanguages available: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish\n\nYou can follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and You Tube!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/asmodeedigital/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/asmodeedigital\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/asmodeedigital/\nYou Tube: https://www.youtube.com/asmodeedigital"

Set across three continents during the turbulent Middle Ages, spectacular conflicts and scheming rivals line the path to power as the great kingdoms of the medieval world vie for supremacy. Be it through diplomacy or conquest, trade or subterfuge, you must secure the resources and loyalty required to rule an empire from the shores of Western Europe to the sands of Arabia.\n\nTHE STRENGTH OF NATIONS\nUnlock up to 17 playable factions and build them into major world powers through statecraft, subterfuge or all-out war.\n\nTHE KINGDOMS EXPANSION\nAvailable via in-app purchase, this massive expansion includes 24 playable factions across four unique, fully featured campaigns. Wage war from the jungles of the Americas to the deserts of the Holy Land, from the deceptively gentle shores of the British Isles to the frigid Baltic plains.\n\nTHE ART OF WAR\nDeploy infantry, archers and cavalry into huge real-time battles, with a full range of medieval weaponry at your command.\n\nTHE TOOLS OF STATE\nUse sophisticated diplomacy, lucrative trade agreements and daring agents to forge alliances or destabilise your rivals.\n\nTHE TEST OF TIME\nShape the destinies of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East through five momentous centuries of combat, competition and conquest.\n\nTHE POWER IN YOUR HANDS\nTake command, with a brand-new user interface and enhanced touch controls for fingertip control of the battlefield. Or, play with any iPadOS-compatible mouse & keyboard.\n\n===\n\nTotal War: MEDIEVAL II requires 4.3GB of free space. For the best possible experience, we recommend playing Total War: MEDIEVAL II on iOS 15 or later. A further 7.65GB is required to install all of the Kingdoms expansion content.

All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens. \r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\r\n\r\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\r\n\r\n- Featuring original art by The Oatmeal\r\n\r\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\r\n \r\n- Digital versions of the hit expansions, including Streaking and Barking Kittens, as well as digital exclusive Betrayal and Party decks\r\n\r\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\r\n\r\nCreat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\r\n\r\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money. You must be at least 13 years old to download and play. There is also an option to compete online against strangers and resulting data transfer charges may apply.

Hide in trash cans, chests, and jars. Slip behind surly guards and take them out while their backs are turned!\n\n- HEADSHOTS: Take out enemies with a single well-placed fling to the cranium.\n\n- HEAD TO HEAD: Play ‘head to head’ against your friends to become the afterlife’s most successful agent.  \n\n- BUREAUCRACY:  Fill out paperwork and reflect on the inherent emptiness of existence!\n\n“Skullduggery!” features the endearingly grotesque art stylings of game artist extraordinaire Bill Mudron, inspired by the Max Fleischer animations of the 1930’s, and a quirky, doom-jazzy, bureau-noir soundtrack from industrial musician Michael Arthur Holloway.\n\nMORE FEATURES:\n\n- NO In App Purchase.  Buy the game, play the game. That’s it!\n- A finely-tuned and deeply-satisfying one-touch control scheme specifically tailored to mobile.\n- Three distinctly unique and atmospheric worlds with more on the way.\n- Dreadful puns.\n- Single Player mode with 24 surreal and pleasantly spooky levels.\n- Multiplayer “Head to Head” mode with a variety of brain-pounding arenas.\n- Hidden rooms and secret chests containing treasure and other delights.\n- Pleasing power-ups and epic boss battles!\n- Dozens of collectables and secondary objectives for maximum replayability.\n- Over 20 unique skulls to unlock, including guest celebrity skulls from some of our favorite games.\n- Universal App - play on your new iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini.\n- Full iCloud support - sync your progress across all your devices.\n- Compete with Game Center Achievements and Leaderboards.\n- Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork!\n\n===================================================\n\nHi, We're ClutchPlay Games!\n\nWe’re a small indie game studio located in not-so-sunny yet idyllic Portland, Oregon.

By constantly intertwining and replacing each other, they maintain balance. The main character named OVO was born of these two halves and has the ability to switch between them. OVO travels through the metaphorical world, overcoming dangers and collecting mysterious symbols. These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.\n\nFeatures:\n■\tFlow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black—upward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being carried by a flow.\n\n■\tFascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions.\n\n■\tDesign without words. There is almost no text in the game and the story is told through gameplay and visuals.\n\n■\tMeditative ambient soundtrack by Brokenkites."

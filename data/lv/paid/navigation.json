      "label": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map. The intuitive design combined with incredible performance puts you in control. Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

We use some magik to compress and package it in a format optimized for mobile devices. Pocket Earth then renders its beautiful vector maps on your device using our OpenGL ES based MagikMap technology.\n\nTo learn more about Pocket Earth or the community driven open data sources that we use, please visit our website.\n\n\nDon’t forget this:\n   1. Using the GPS features of this app can significantly affect battery life. Only leave GPS enabled when you need to use it. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Pocket Earth only uses GPS in the background for route navigation and gps track recording features. \n   2. This app uses data from the amazing community driven open mapping project called openstreetmap.org!  Coverage detail may vary by region, please visit our website to check the map detail for your regions of interest.\n   3. Does not currently support all asian texts on the map (Chinese, Japanese, etc)."

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Jonathan J. Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe used his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nCreated on the battlefield, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused navigation app available on the App Store. It is also the only combat-proven app available today. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

Farm Sprayer GPS is a simple tool that allows you to set the width of your implement and see where you have sprayed or spread fertilizer using the the GPS built into your phone or tablet or with an external GPS antenna. Use it for tillage, spraying, planting, or anything else. Farm Sprayer GPS highlights the ground you have covered and shows overlap. The maps can be saved to the device so that you do not need data in the field.\n\n!!Use with caution!! Phone and Tablet GPS providers can be off by meters. Not all devices have GPS antennas built in.

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

The map size is limited only by the iPhone or iPad's storage capacity.\n• Imported maps of different scales can be viewed simultaneously, adjacent to or overlapping each other.  \n• Multiple tracks can be displayed on maps simultaneously and tracks with named waypoints can be searched like a directory or gazetteer.\n\nWe recommend that you review our website www.rocketsplashgames.com/mapsntrax/support/ and the online User Guide to be sure that MAPS n TRAX suits your requirements.  The User Guide section on Preparing Maps describes the process to prepare a plain image file for use as a location-calibrated and mobile-optimized map image.\n\nContinued use of the GPS running in the background can dramatically reduce battery life on the iPhone or iPad."

Sei il benvenuto.\nPrima di partire, però, devi sapere che in molte città italiane, a differenza di quelle europee, esistono delle zone urbane in cui è impossibile accedere con l'automobile. Le Zone a Traffico Limitato (ZTL) sono sorvegliate dai vigili urbani e protette da telecamere che controllano gli accessi. Alcune di esse sono in funzione 24 ore su 24, altre vengono aperte agli automobilisti solo per alcune ore al giorno.  Se per caso dovessi accedere in una di queste zone, saresti costretto a pagare una multa che va dagli 80,00 euro ai 335,00 euro. Lo sappiamo, ti sembrano cifre assurde ma in Italia le regole sono queste.\nNon preoccuparti più del dovuto, però!  Scarica ZTL Italia e parti sicuro e informato. \nQuest'app è l'unica che contiene una mappa aggiornata con tutte le ZTL d'Italia. Facilissima ed attendibile, funziona come un navigatore. Grazie ad un sistema di allarme personalizzato, ogni volta che ti avvicinerai ad una ZTL una voce ti avvertirà in tempo e ti dirà se la zona è aperta o chiusa. Puoi avere ZTL Italia anche nel centro notifica del tuo smartphone o Tablet perché include il widget. \n\nVisita l'Italia senza brutte sorprese, scarica ZTL Italia e buon viaggio!\n\n*** Ultimo aggiornamento varchi: 29 Marzo 2017 ***"

It's like having a log book and data recorder in your pocket! Hot air is loaded with lots of different features; many based on pilot feedback from around the world.\n\n---------------------------\nMajor Features:\n---------------------------\n\n- Real-time tracking! Great for improving situationally awareness, see your current location on a map or satellite imagery\n\n- Waypoints to show your distance, bearing, and ETE to a target location\n\n- Offline maps available\n\n- Record your entire flight path (you can even turn your screen off during recording)! Then you can export your flight to your computer and view it in 3D using Google Earth\n\n- KML/KMZ overlays! Add custom overlay data to the real-time flight maps (can be used to map out electric lines, friendly or unfriendly places to land, denoting special airspaces, include information such as radio frequencies or phone numbers, etc.).\n\n- Wind data tracking - records wind speed and direction at the various altitudes as you fly\n\n- Integration of the Glympse location sharing service to allow ground crew, family, or others to track your flight in real-time. They can track you using almost any device with a data connection. \n\n- Flight Log- the log makes it easy to track information common to all pilots such as crew members, passengers, maximum envelope temperature, and propane used. The log also makes saving takeoff and landing locations convenient, thanks to the iPhone’s GPS or triangulation capabilities; plus, it has a \"favorites\" list for takeoff locations. The log can also aid in flight planning and separates future flights from past flights using a simple color-coding scheme. \n\n- Flight Data Summary: this tab quickly tallies flights and hours flown. The summary includes a total of all flights or just the ones made within the past 90 days. Plus a summary of the crew used for past flights.\n\n- Summary Map: on the map tab, the logged flights that have a saved takeoff and landing location can be plotted and compared on an interactive map \n\n- Data export: export your flight log in HTML, KML (for viewing in Google Earth), and GPX (GPS Exchange)\n\n- Data backup and restore - to be certain your data is safe!\n\n- Comprehensive payload calculator\n\n- Measure Tool\n\n- View weather conditions and forecasts from within the app\n\n- Universal app - works on iPad (landscape and portrait) as well as the iPhone and iPod touch! \n\n- Facebook integration - it is easy to post a quick summary of your latest flight to Facebook and even includes a link to a map! \n\n- Real-time tracking heading projection-line option\n\n---------------------------\nThis app includes translations in English, French, Czech, and Slovak!\n---------------------------\n\nNote: During real-time flight mode the GPS is continuously running in the background which can significantly decrease battery life."

The distance and average speed counters can be used in kilometers or miles.\n \nMain functions:\n- keep track of the current part of your roadbook.\n- display totals of the current track.\n- monitor average speed during a certain period or distance of the track.\n\nAfter completing a track you will be able to view it on a map and send it through e-mail for later use. The created tracklog is a typical gpx-style document.\n\nIn this application you will not be able to import gpx-files or other types of tracklogs created by others. The application is mainly build to make life easier during an amateur rally with a roadbook and especial for use in cars which lack a speedometer with 100 meter (day)counter.\n\nThis application has been extensively tested to ensure it meets the regulations for trip computers. Be aware that gps-devices are not allowed in official rally-events.\n\nFor use on iPhone."

You can enter an address.\n3. You can store a custom latitude and longitude coordinate.\n4. You can drop a pin on the map where ever you would like.\n\nThe location information is all editable after you store it.\n\nThere is an option to draw lines between the map location displayed on the map.  You can draw a line between all of the locations in the order selected including the user location.  You can draw a line from the user location to the last location selected.  You can draw a line form the user location to the first location selected.  And you can draw a line between all of the points excluding the user location.  This last option is handy when trying to compute distance on a map.  When drawing any lines on the map, the distance is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen.\n\nThere is a meter on the main page that measures the accuracy of the GPS signal.\n\nYou can display your heading and altitude on the main page as an option."

Please see details on our website at http://oxigenator.com/products/camcarder/ . We suggest that you connect your iPhone to a power, rather than using it on a battery.\n\nSo if your phone receives an incoming call or you want to switch to another app, CamCarDer will save current clip. You can start new clip manually, or set application to auto-start it when application goes back to foreground."

Tasks like making a projection from a waypoint, determining a new waypoint using two other waypoints, determining the distance to these waypoints, calculating the value of a Roman numeral, and averaging waypoints are examples of what the toolkit can accomplish.\n\nImagine it’s lovely weather and you are walking in a beautiful surrounding. Walking with an intention, because you are geocaching and searching for caches.\n\nPicture you are at waypoint 3 of a multi cache and you’re asked to go to waypoint 4, which is 300 meter from this waypoint and 700 meter from the previous waypoint. Now what? Go home? Imagine you have a skilful toolkit with you to find your way. Imagine you have iGCT PRO, because you want to be ready for all these kind of challenges.\n\nBuy it now for a fixed low price (no in-app purchase necessary), since you never know if you have internet access the moment you need it most!\nThe choice is yours.\n\nComplete feature list:\n\nList of waypoints\n=================\n- Averaging a number of GPS readings for accurate coordinates\n- Manage a list of named waypoints\n- Search/filter list of waypoints\n- Show overview map with all (filtered) waypoints\n- Manually add a new waypoint\n- Edit latitude, longitude in WGS84, degrees, DMS, UTM, Dutch/Swiss XY\n- What3words\n- Compass navigation to selected waypoint\n\nCalculations\n============\n- Project new waypoint using distance/bearing\n- Distance/bearing between two known waypoints\n- Cross two wp/bearing lines\n- Cross wp/bearing line with circle around other wp\n- Cross two circles around 2 waypoints\n- Determine wp with same distance to 3 other waypoints\n- Cross two lines, each line connects two waypoints\n\nText to number\n==============\n- Calculate the sum of the character values in one or more words, the sum of all digits in this sum and finally sum the digits once more to typically arrive at one digit.\n- Choose between a=1, b=2 etc., the inverse a=26, b=25 etc. or the phone numbering abc=2, def=3 etc.\n\nEn/Decrypt\n===============\nVarious encryption and decryption methods typically used in geocache descriptions:\n- Rotate characters by N positions\n- Caesar (Rot13)\n- Morse\n- Vigenere \n\nNumbers\n=======\nConvert between these number systems:\n- Roman\n- Decimal (base 10)\n- Binary (base 2)\n- Hexadecimal (base 16)"

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

For example, an E6B can be used to calculate heading and groundspeed after taking into account forecast winds. An E6B is also used to calculate data used for performance planning such as density altitude.  Our version goes beyond the analog E6B and even beyond all other E6B apps by including functionality to calculate time, rate and radius of turns, pivotal altitude (great for flight training use), and more."

And then you just follow the arrow and watch the distance to your destination reduce.\n\n No Internet and maps required!\n\n Apart from your current location, you can add any other place as long as you know its latitude and longitude.\n\n You can add a photo to each location to remind you what it looks like.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Do we really need one more?\n\nAriadne GPS is more than a simple gps app.\n\nBesides offering you the possibility to know your position and to get information about the street, the number, etc. it also lets you explore the map of what's around you.\n\nWhat do we mean by saying \"explore\"? You'll deal with a talking map. If you have VoiceOver activated on your device, you will be able to know the street names and numbers that are around you by touching them.\nJust put your finger on the screen of your device, when showing the map and moving it you will be told the info's about the street you're touching.\nYour position is on the center of the screen. What's in front of you is on the top half of the screen and things behind you are on the bottom half of the screen.\n\nYou can also explore a different region than the one around you by telling the app the street and the city.\n\nYou can ask for information about your position at any time, also activating a function, called monitor, that will give you this info periodically (Please read the note below).\nThis app has also got some other useful features that might help when walking or traveling by bus, train etc.\nIf you add your favourite points to the app database, you can be alerted when you get closer than a certain distance to one of them.\n\nThis app is completely accessible using VoiceOver and gives you access to information that are normally unavailable to people using the speech synthesizer and can be therefore especially useful to blind and partially sighted people. \n\nNote: The features of Ariadne GPS are based on the location services and on the Maps server for what concerns the information about the position. This information may not be accurate, due to the location accuracy, which is generally below fifteen metres but in some cases can be few tens of metres and to the Maps service, which might be unresponsive at certain times (Ariadne GPS will tell you if this is the case). The aim of Ariadne GPS is to give you an idea of your position and what is around you. Please do not completely rely on it.\n\nPlease note that the use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nFor more info and suggestions please visit http://www.ariadnegps.eu"

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin. You can add as many Kin as you like to calculate the Combined Kin for a group of people. \n\n+ Tzolkin with indication of the GAP day's and Wavespell and more. Tap and hold to select a Kin number directly.\n\n+ Contact Import \nAll contacts in your Contacts App will be automatically imported and assigned to the correct Kin. See all your contacts with their Mayan Reading and how you relate to them. \n\n+ 13 Moon Calendar \nFull integration of 13 Moon Calendar. (doubles as a birthday calendar!) \n\n+ 13:20 Information \nLots of information about the theory behind synchronization to help you navigate the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar. The texts provide a clear explanation of the Cycles of Time. (More than 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\n+ Sharing\nOn all the 3 main tabs you can share the current selected Galactic Signature using your favorite app. \n\n\n# Based on the work of José Argüelles.\n# This app was made with permission of and in cooperation with the Foundation for the Law of Time - www.lawoftime.org, \n# Ariel Spilsbury."

The program is especially adapted for the usage by glider, hangglider and paraglider pilots.  SkyLogger obtains the geodetic positions of the pilot during the flight and stores the data. Furthermore, the pilot is able to see during the flight the elapsed time, the distance to the take-off as well as the current ground speed and climb rate. A compass rose is indicating the current flight direction. \nFor competitions the pilot's and the aircraft's name, the aircraft's ID and the to be flown route can be entered.  During the flight the direction and distance to the next waypoint are shown on the display.\n\nAfter finishing the flight the stored geodetic data together with the data for the competition can be converted into the common IGC file format. Additionally, also other popular formats like GPX and KML are supported. The created files are stored on the iPhone or can be sent to servers or other computers.\n\nSkyLogger supports besides others the following features:\n\n - control by Apple Watch;\n - main data visualization on Apple Watch;\n - cockpit / instrument view;\n - 2D & 3D flight data visualization;\n - downloadable map data;\n - large and individually adaptable instruments on a moving map allow best viewing comfort;\n - north or in flight direction orientation of moving map;\n - live tracking support for Leonardo or Vgps servers\n - visualization of previously flown flights as track traces on moving map;\n - visualization of airspaces with user defined colors;\n - instrument showing the distance and direction to the closest airspace;\n - 3 axis acceleration measurements;\n - tracked flights are stored in highly efficient internal database;\n - default flight parameters can be stored and retrieved to make flight information entering for competitions easier;\n - SkyLoggerXXL supports common file formats like IGC, CSV, GPX and KML;\n - IGC files created by SkyLoggerXXL are OLC conform and can directly be sent to Leonardo, XCCup, XContest and XC globe based OLC servers;\n - calculation of XC points for FAI triangle, triangle and free distance over 5 points;\n - XC analysis (determination of FAI triangle areas);\n - printing of flightbooks, flight information and statistics\n - all diagrams, maps or charts can either be e-mailed or copied for incorporation into other apps;\n - integration of SkyView database for exchanging waypoints;\n - support of FlyNet accessories;\n - support of SensBox;\n - weather data history of selected weather stations for the last 48 hours;\n - online wind speed and direction visualization on maps for selected weather stations;\n - visualization of hotspots;\n - visualization of regions with thermals;\n - visualization of climb rate traces;\n - and much much more!\n\nWarning: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Discover Multiplans, a powerful map application in which you can import your maps (whatever their source) and view them offline with a great multitouch experience and pinpoint accurate GPS positioning. Multiplans can moreover record tracks and save points of interests. \n\nMultiplans has been designed to offer a great map viewing experience: simple uncluttered interface, map shown full screen (a single tap toggles on/off the display of overlay information), ultra-fast scrolling and zooming. \n\nWith Multiplans, you don't have to buy again maps that you already own, just to use them on your iPhone. No subscription either that will soon expire. To use a map on your iPhone/iPad, simply transfer the map image into Multiplans (with a .map or ref.txt calibration file if you have one). Maps can be also calibrated entirely within Multiplans by defining graphically calibration points on the map.  \n\nA few sample maps are provided with Multiplans: a world map, a map of Switzerland, etc. A few more maps can be downloaded free of charge from www.multiplans.net. Multiplans is compatible with almost all coordinate systems used in the world. To import your own maps into Multiplans and have accurate GPS positioning, the map needs to be calibrated (see www.multiplans.net). Maps from OpenStreetMap (for any region in the world), as well as maps from similar mapping web sites, can be imported into Multiplans very easily by using the free program mobile atlas creator.\n\nVisit www.multiplans.net for more information.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Continued use of the GPS running in the background can dramatically reduce battery life on the iPhone or iPad.\n- Multiplans' features, including map and location accuracy, should not be depended upon in situations where inaccuracies or errors could cause danger, commercial loss or any other problem. Though we did our best to make Multiplans an excellent app, it is provided as is with no warranty."

You can also record the exact spot where you parked your car or bike, so you can find it back after caching.\n\nFIRST LOOK: To get an idea of the functionality, read the Quick Start Guide on the gcbuddy.com website.\n\nList of possibilities:\n==========================\n- Management of multiple caches in a list of downloaded caches\n- Download from geocaching.com, opencache.uk and other opencaching sites\n- Prepare a multi-cache at home, also possible on your PC or Mac using a simple web interface.\n- All images in the description are downloaded: paperless caching!\n- Navigate to the parking place\n- Enter answers to questions at each waypoint\n    * Common text calculations like word value\n    * Stack counting\n    * Convert roman numbers\n- Change the value of an answer and immediately see the effect on a map with waypoints\n- Waypoints are automatically calculated using the values for A...Z\n- Location of the final cache is also calculated automatically in this way\n- Built-in compass/map for navigation to the next waypoint\n- Overview map with all waypoints\n- Warning by vibration or sound when you are near the waypoint\n- Accurately record data at a waypoint with your camera.\n- Album for each cache with the possibility to view the pictures with the ultra zoom photo viewer.\n- Notes can be entered before or during the cache\n- Log directly on geocaching.com after the find if you wish\n- Find your way back to the car park\n- Send an e-mail with all the information of a cache as backup or to a friend\n- Write with one click all cache information in the (online) personal cache note\n- Restore a cache from a backup e-mail\n- Protect a cache against changes\n- Backup/Restore via iCloud\n\nProblems/questions/feedback please send an e-mail (info@gcbuddy.com) so I can answer quickly."

The App is user friendly and has jog dials that can be moved around smoothly to set the direction. The results are depicted in a fraction of a second saving time, and instead of opening a book to get the corresponding Beaufort force, sea states, compass points or wave heights – This App saves you all that trouble.\n\nThe inputs are:\nShip’s speed in nautical miles per hour (knots) or meters/sec (m/s).\nShip’s direction from zero to 360 degrees on compass.\nRelative wind direction as displayed on a standard shipboard anemometer from zero to 180 degrees port or starboard (stbd).\nRelative wind speed in nautical miles per hour (knots) or meters/sec (m/s).\n\n The following results are displayed after pressing the calculate button:\nTrue wind speed in nautical miles per hour (knots) or meters/sec (m/s).\nTrue wind direction from zero to 360 degrees on compass.\nTrue wind direction in terms of compass points\nCorresponding Beaufort force and description\nCorresponding Sea state description and code\nProbable wave height for the corresponding true wind speed.\nA photograph of what the sea state may look like.\n\nDeveloper: Captain Darren D’Souza – Master Mariner"

You can Create/Edit/Remove the bookmark folders at any time. \n* In-app browser. You don't need to switch to Safari to open web pages when viewing articles, But if you need to go to Safari, there's a quick and easy button for that! \n* In-app email for sharing articles, so you don't need to switch to Mail App. \n* Search whatever you need in all or only selected feeds. You can also save as many searches you want and manage them later. \n\n\nYou'll receive Push Notifications ( Alert, Badge count and Sound ) on your favorite news stories as soon they come out. And you can also customize this notification by selecting the “ON or OFF” switch for each news feed to which you've subscribed. \n\nNaturally, you'll need folders to organize your feeds, and Simple RSS+ can do that easily too! You can also move feeds between folders, and rename or remove them any time you wish. And each time you get new feeds into your folders or receive new articles, the folder icon will show you how many articles there still unread. You can also store your favorite articles and create bookmark folders to help keep them all organized. And of course, you can move the articles between the bookmark folders too. \n\nSimple RSS+ have a powerful search tool that enables you to define the search criteria for your feeds. Save the search and the next time you open it, the new articles that match your criteria will be there automatically. You can also edit your saved searches or move them into any folder to keep everything organized.\n\n\n#####################      日本語      #####################\n\nお気に入りのサイトをチェックできるシンプルなRSSリーダーです。\nサイトのRSSフィードを登録すれば、簡単にサイトの更新確認や閲覧が出来ます。\n\nアプリの機能\n==========\n• 記事の更新時はプッシュ通知でお知らせ\n• 登録したサイトの閲覧\n• 未読記事の件数表示\n• ニュース　ブックマーク\n• 検索機能\n• 検索キーワード保存機能\n\nシェアー\n=======\n• Pocket\n• メール\n• メッセージ"

      "label": "Love RSS feeds? So do we!!\n\nRSS feeds are a great way to follow updates on your favorite website. However, some sites set up their feeds to only show a portion of each entry, you know, to get you to click through to their actual website. We find that really annoying, and we're sure you do too.\n\nWhich is why, unlike other RSS feed readers, that either push you into a browser (in-app or otherwise), or depend on third party text parsing services and require you to be online to fetch the full text of one article at a time (which makes it no different from having to click/tap through to a website), in lire, you get your favorite RSS feeds as they should've been. You don't need to click through to any website (though, you do still have the option to, if you really wanted). It takes your favorite partial feeds, does its magic, and converts them in to full feeds, so you don't have to click/tap on those annoying 'Read more' or 'Continue reading' links.\n\nOnce they're cached, you don't even need to be connected to read your full-text feeds.\n\nUse as a standalone feed reader, sync with iCloud,\n\nor,\n\nsync with any of the several services: Feedly, Feedbin, FeedHQ, The Old Reader, Inoreader, BazQux Reader, Newsblur, Feed Wrangler, FreshRSS, Miniflux, Nextcloud News, Tiny Tiny RSS."

The App lets you subscribe and organize your news feeds, which will be updated fully automatically, so you always have the latest news available within the App. All articles will presented for a comfortable reading experience, but of course the original web view is also available.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLegi is special among RSS readers, because it has a speech output feature. This means the App can read all articles aloud when you can not read these yourself, for example when driving a car, while doing sports and for many other activities where you can't look on your device. The App has a full-featured audio player for the speech output (Play/Pause, skip back/forward, a timeline etc.) which works similar to the one of a music player App. Of course, all remote controls for music (the one from the control center, headphones, or Apple Watch) will work for Legi as well, so Legi can be in the background as well.\n\nThe full text of all articles will be presented in a comfortable reading mode, for which you can configure colors, fonts, text size etc. to match your own preferences. \n\nAn offline mode makes it possible to read all articles even if no internet connection is available. In addition the App lets you configure when and under which conditions the data is loaded, so you can load most or all of the data using WiFi and less or no data in mobile networks to avoid traffic.\n\nYou can also create \"smart playlists\" to categorize and organize articles independently of the feeds.\n\nSeveral 3rd-party services to manage your feeds are supported as well: \n- FeedWrangler\n- Feed HQ, FeedBlur\n- FeedBin\n- BazQux\n- InoReader\n- The Old Reader\n\nAlso feeds can be saved as favorites, you can export or import your feeds via OPML, you can share articles using the ShareSheet and much more.\n\nThe Watch App lets you read or listen to (via speech output) articles on your Apple Watch as well. This is great for all the occasions where you do not have your iPhone with you, for example for all kinds of sports activities"

That's what we're doing here. Giving each Clann a small platform to put their group on show to allow new members to find and join them.  \n\nOur sense of shared identity is in taking the work of getting an App together and providing a place where small groups can share their updates.

In order to accomplish this, we start at the very root: the design! We believe in delivering the best viewing experience which is why we have absolutely no ads! We also pride ourselves on our minimal design, obstructing all distraction. Most importantly, we believe in delivering experience possible so you can digest information with no interruptions at all.\n\nNext comes the information. We ask you to tune your interests so that you can see news articles based on your interests. However, Views isn't just another news reading application. In order to help you stay up to date in your busy lives, we utilize artificial intelligence to analyze a news article and present you with an informed summarized version. Of course, not all of us have the time to read at our own pace which is why we give you the option of saving articles offline so you can read them at a later date.\n\nAnother great way to stay updated is to tune in to your favorite podcasts. WIth Views 4, we introduce an all-new podcast player designed only for you. You can save your favorite podcasts and download individual episodes for offline listening. Whether you're driving or simply prefer an auditory experience over a visual experience, we've made sure to help you. \n\nFinally, all this information means we need a great way to organize and search through it. Once again, we've relied on machine learning for this task. Rather than fine-tune every aspect of your search, simply search using natural language. For example: \"Search all podcasts for latest news\" or \"Display the top technology news\" gives you just that. Nothing that you wouldn't expect.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThere's a lot of noise in today's social medias and it can be hard to determine what's true and what's fake. We decided we had enough of the shouting matches online so we take very great care in sourcing our articles from reliable sources (powered by NewsAPI).\n\nIn a world where the news we receive can be questionable and sometimes opposing, Views  4 wants to present information with beautiful clarity, both visually and audibly, so what are you waiting for? Download the best news app today!"

We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education.

      "label": "Learning a language can be an experience that transforms your life. Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n• 2019 PCMag Editors’ Choice\n• 2019 Tabby Awards Winner\n• 2019 Best Mobile App Awards: Best Designed App and Best Overall App\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next.

Flip between languages as often as you’d like and enjoy the freedom to get seriously curious. To access, simply select Unlimited Languages when you subscribe. \n\n\nChoose from 24 languages: \nArabic, Chinese (Mandarin), Dutch, English (American or British), Filipino (Tagalog), French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin American or Spain), Swedish, Turkish, or Vietnamese. \n\n\n\nSelect a subscription: \nWe offer 3 and 12-month subscriptions—as well as a Lifetime option. \n\n\n\nSubscription Details:\n• Get full access to all lessons, stories, and audio companion when you subscribe to Rosetta Stone. \n• Payment will be charged to your Apple ID. \n• Your account will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• Manage or cancel your subscription from your App Store User Settings at any time after purchasing.

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Împreună cu răţuştele va învăţa şi va exersa într-un mod relaxat şi jucăuş primii paşi în domeniul matematicii.\nJocul are trei niveluri, fiecare din ele oferindu-i un mod amuzant de a învăţa cum arată şi cum se numesc cifrele cât şi ordinea numerelor de la 1 la 10.\n\nKidsopia oferă o gamă largă de jocuri distractive şi modalităţi creative de a învăţa copilul lucruri noi.\nPlatforma Kidsopia este perfectă pentru micuţii de 2 şi 3 ani, pentru copii de grădiniţă (de la 4 la 5 ani) şi pentru cei care abia acum încep şcoala (6 şi 7 ani), prezentându-le multe din ideile de bază şi noţiunile pe care un copil trebuie să le înţeleagă şi să le stăpânească corect.\nKidsopia este o platformă educaţională bazată pe studiul UNICEF: “Repere Fundamentale pentru Învăţarea Timpurie a Copilului de la Naştere până la 7 ani” (RFIDT).\nDorim să oferim o cale amuzantă şi intuitivă de a învăţa cifrele, număratul şi literele, desenatul şi coloratul, mărimi, forme şi imagini, diferenţe şi asemănări, animale şi multe altele, toate prezentate prin intermediul jocurilor şi poveştilor noastre.\nÎnglobând cele cinci arii de dezvoltare: intelectuală, creativă, emoţională, dezvoltare fizică şi dezvoltarea socială platforma Kidsopia oferă un element ajutător pentru părinţi în procesul de educare al copiilor prin joacă.\nNe-am bazat pe exerciţiu şi practică ca fundament în procesul de învăţare al domeniilor precum ştiinţă (matematică, geometrie, fizică, chimie), biologie (corpul uman, animale, plante), artă (colorat, desenat, pictat), logică (puzzle-uri de imagini şi cuvinte), dezvoltarea emoţională (conştiinţa de sine, încrederea în sine, moduri de a face faţă şi a înţelege sentimentele).\nCu ajutorul platformei Kidsopia copilul va trece printr-un proces constând în 3 etape:\n1. Acumularea şi înţelegerea noilor concepte. \n2. Fundamentarea acestor noţiuni prin procesul de exersare. \n3. Dezvoltarea capacităţii de a recunoaşte, asocia şi aplica aceste noi informaţii.\nScopul aplicaţiilor din Kidsopia este ca cei mici să înveţe într-o manieră relaxată, jucăuşă şi inteligentă conceptele expuse mai sus.\n\nMai multe detalii pe: www.kidsopia.ro\nLimba: Româna (România, Moldova)"

Alături de Steambot, Dieselbot și Electrobot copiii vor învăța procese tehnologice distractive și, fără să își dea seama, vor ști cum se scriu literele.\n  - Steambot le va arăta copiilor care sunt vectorii de scriere trasând și tăind litere în plăci mari de tablă. Una câte una ele vor fi pregătite pentru următorul proces tehnologic.\n  - literele proaspăt tăiate vor ajunge la robotul Dieselbot unde vor fi șlefuite pentru a arăta minunat. Copiii îl vor ajuta pe acesta să obțină cele mai strălucitoare litere din alfabet desenând după ghid fiecare literă în parte.\n  - totul va culmina cu atelierul lui Electrobot: aici micuții vor învăța cum se trasează liber literele ajutându-l pe electricianul vagonului să pună fire, fasunguri și neoane ce vor lumina feeric!\n\nVagonul Roboților este disponibil în limba Română.\n\nEvoluția le va fi răsplătită cu animații minunate, cu pârâieli și pufneli distractive pentru ca cei mici să nu își dea seama cât de mult au învățat cu adevărat! Obosiți dar fericiți își vor vedea operele strălucind pe acoperișuri celebre din toată lumea.\n\nÎn curând alte vagoane ale trenului vor fi adăugate pentru ca micuții să se distreze învățând să formeze cuvinte, să descopere litere în contextul cuvintelor, să recunoască auzind literele în cadrul unui cuvânt, să citească cuvinte și mai apoi să își surprindă părinții învățând cum scriu literele!\n\nVă place jocul nostru? Dacă da, daţi-ne un rating!\n\nKidsopia oferă o gamă largă de jocuri distractive şi modalităţi creative de a învăţa copilul lucruri noi.\nPlatforma Kidsopia este perfectă pentru micuţii de 2 şi 3 ani, pentru copii de grădiniţă (de la 4 la 5 ani) şi pentru cei care abia acum încep şcoala (6 şi 7 ani), prezentându-le multe din ideile de bază şi noţiunile pe care un copil trebuie să le înţeleagă şi să le stăpânească corect.\nKidsopia este o platformă educaţională bazată pe studiul UNICEF: “Repere Fundamentale pentru Învăţarea Timpurie a Copilului de la Naştere până la 7 ani” (RFIDT).\n\nDorim să oferim o cale amuzantă şi intuitivă de a învăţa cifrele, număratul şi literele, desenatul şi coloratul, mărimi, forme şi imagini, diferenţe şi asemănări, animale şi multe altele, toate prezentate prin intermediul jocurilor şi poveştilor noastre.\n\nCu ajutorul platformei Kidsopia copilul va trece printr-un proces constând în 3 etape:\n\n1. Acumularea şi înţelegerea noilor concepte. \n2. Fundamentarea acestor noţiuni prin procesul de exersare. \n3. Dezvoltarea capacităţii de a recunoaşte, asocia şi aplica aceste noi informaţii.\n\nScopul aplicaţiilor din Kidsopia este ca cei mici să înveţe într-o manieră relaxată, jucăuşă şi inteligentă conceptele expuse mai sus.\n\nMai multe detalii pe: www.kidsopia.ro"

Peste 270 de modele de desen (printre care casă, soare, flori, băiețel, fetiță, bărbat, femeie, telefon și multe altele) îl vor ajuta pe copilul tău să participe la crearea unei lumi minunate. Povestea îl poartă pe Mowgli din micuțul sat indian până la Paris, într-o călătorie pe 3 continente, în căutarea vechilor lui prieteni din junglă: Bagheera, Baloo, Kaa și Fratele Cenușiu. \n\nDeenează cu Mowgli face parte din proiectul educativ Kidsopia, cel mai de succes proiect de acest fel din România.\n\nKidsopia oferă o gamă largă de jocuri distractive şi modalităţi creative de a învăţa copilul lucruri noi. \nPlatforma Kidsopia este perfectă pentru micuţii de 2 şi 3 ani, pentru copii de grădiniţă (de la 4 la 5 ani) şi pentru cei care abia acum încep şcoala (6 şi 7 ani), prezentându-le multe din ideile de bază şi noţiunile pe care un copil trebuie să le înţeleagă şi să le stăpânească corect. \nKidsopia este o platformă educaţională bazată pe studiul UNICEF: “Repere Fundamentale pentru Învăţarea Timpurie a Copilului de la Naştere până la 7 ani” (RFIDT). \n\nNe-am bazat pe exerciţiu şi practică ca fundament în procesul de învăţare al domeniilor precum ştiinţă (matematică, geometrie, fizică, chimie), biologie (corpul uman, animale, plante), artă (colorat, desenat, pictat), logică (puzzle-uri de imagini şi cuvinte), dezvoltarea emoţională (conştiinţa de sine, încrederea în sine, moduri de a face faţă şi a înţelege sentimentele). \nCu ajutorul platformei Kidsopia copilul va trece printr-un proces constând în 3 etape: \n\n1. Acumularea şi înţelegerea noilor concepte. \n2. Fundamentarea acestor noţiuni prin procesul de exersare. \n3. Dezvoltarea capacităţii de a recunoaşte, asocia şi aplica aceste noi informaţii. \n\nScopul aplicaţiilor din Kidsopia este ca cei mici să înveţe într-o manieră relaxată, jucăuşă şi inteligentă conceptele expuse mai sus. \n\nMai multe detalii pe: http://www.kidsopia.ro \n\nLimba: Româna (România, Moldova)"

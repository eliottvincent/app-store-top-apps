Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York. Lively, colorful, and sometimes surprising characters: an eccentric old lady will help you find a place to live, and a greedy hot-dog vendor who will try to short-change… They (and many more) speak different accents and will help you master street talk. There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go. Each conversation takes no more than 3 minutes and will fit into even the busiest of schedules.\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY\n\nYou’ll learn 6,000 of the most common words everyone needs to travel, work, and communicate in a foreign language. Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations. Built-in games will challenge your skill and speed – you can even compete with other users around the world in real-time!"

Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus.

Whether it’s Harry Potter in German or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer.

      "label": "Unul din cele mai captivante jocuri de numărat pentru copii până la 5 ani! Alături de boboceii de raţă copiii vor învăţa cifrele şi ordinea numerelor de la 1 la 10.\nCopilul va lua parte la momentul în care boboceii de raţă ies din ouă iar apoi se poate juca cu ei pe lac. Împreună cu răţuştele va învăţa şi va exersa într-un mod relaxat şi jucăuş primii paşi în domeniul matematicii.\nJocul are trei niveluri, fiecare din ele oferindu-i un mod amuzant de a învăţa cum arată şi cum se numesc cifrele cât şi ordinea numerelor de la 1 la 10.\n\nKidsopia oferă o gamă largă de jocuri distractive şi modalităţi creative de a învăţa copilul lucruri noi.\nPlatforma Kidsopia este perfectă pentru micuţii de 2 şi 3 ani, pentru copii de grădiniţă (de la 4 la 5 ani) şi pentru cei care abia acum încep şcoala (6 şi 7 ani), prezentându-le multe din ideile de bază şi noţiunile pe care un copil trebuie să le înţeleagă şi să le stăpânească corect.\nKidsopia este o platformă educaţională bazată pe studiul UNICEF: “Repere Fundamentale pentru Învăţarea Timpurie a Copilului de la Naştere până la 7 ani” (RFIDT).\nDorim să oferim o cale amuzantă şi intuitivă de a învăţa cifrele, număratul şi literele, desenatul şi coloratul, mărimi, forme şi imagini, diferenţe şi asemănări, animale şi multe altele, toate prezentate prin intermediul jocurilor şi poveştilor noastre.\nÎnglobând cele cinci arii de dezvoltare: intelectuală, creativă, emoţională, dezvoltare fizică şi dezvoltarea socială platforma Kidsopia oferă un element ajutător pentru părinţi în procesul de educare al copiilor prin joacă.\nNe-am bazat pe exerciţiu şi practică ca fundament în procesul de învăţare al domeniilor precum ştiinţă (matematică, geometrie, fizică, chimie), biologie (corpul uman, animale, plante), artă (colorat, desenat, pictat), logică (puzzle-uri de imagini şi cuvinte), dezvoltarea emoţională (conştiinţa de sine, încrederea în sine, moduri de a face faţă şi a înţelege sentimentele).\nCu ajutorul platformei Kidsopia copilul va trece printr-un proces constând în 3 etape:\n1. Acumularea şi înţelegerea noilor concepte. \n2. Fundamentarea acestor noţiuni prin procesul de exersare. \n3. Dezvoltarea capacităţii de a recunoaşte, asocia şi aplica aceste noi informaţii.\nScopul aplicaţiilor din Kidsopia este ca cei mici să înveţe într-o manieră relaxată, jucăuşă şi inteligentă conceptele expuse mai sus.\n\nMai multe detalii pe: www.kidsopia.ro\nLimba: Româna (România, Moldova)"

Împreună cu răţuştele va învăţa şi va exersa într-un mod relaxat şi jucăuş primii paşi în domeniul matematicii.\nJocul are trei niveluri, fiecare din ele oferindu-i un mod amuzant de a învăţa cum arată şi cum se numesc cifrele cât şi ordinea numerelor de la 1 la 10.\n\nKidsopia oferă o gamă largă de jocuri distractive şi modalităţi creative de a învăţa copilul lucruri noi.\nPlatforma Kidsopia este perfectă pentru micuţii de 2 şi 3 ani, pentru copii de grădiniţă (de la 4 la 5 ani) şi pentru cei care abia acum încep şcoala (6 şi 7 ani), prezentându-le multe din ideile de bază şi noţiunile pe care un copil trebuie să le înţeleagă şi să le stăpânească corect.\nKidsopia este o platformă educaţională bazată pe studiul UNICEF: “Repere Fundamentale pentru Învăţarea Timpurie a Copilului de la Naştere până la 7 ani” (RFIDT).\nDorim să oferim o cale amuzantă şi intuitivă de a învăţa cifrele, număratul şi literele, desenatul şi coloratul, mărimi, forme şi imagini, diferenţe şi asemănări, animale şi multe altele, toate prezentate prin intermediul jocurilor şi poveştilor noastre.\nÎnglobând cele cinci arii de dezvoltare: intelectuală, creativă, emoţională, dezvoltare fizică şi dezvoltarea socială platforma Kidsopia oferă un element ajutător pentru părinţi în procesul de educare al copiilor prin joacă.\nNe-am bazat pe exerciţiu şi practică ca fundament în procesul de învăţare al domeniilor precum ştiinţă (matematică, geometrie, fizică, chimie), biologie (corpul uman, animale, plante), artă (colorat, desenat, pictat), logică (puzzle-uri de imagini şi cuvinte), dezvoltarea emoţională (conştiinţa de sine, încrederea în sine, moduri de a face faţă şi a înţelege sentimentele).\nCu ajutorul platformei Kidsopia copilul va trece printr-un proces constând în 3 etape:\n1. Acumularea şi înţelegerea noilor concepte. \n2. Fundamentarea acestor noţiuni prin procesul de exersare. \n3. Dezvoltarea capacităţii de a recunoaşte, asocia şi aplica aceste noi informaţii.\nScopul aplicaţiilor din Kidsopia este ca cei mici să înveţe într-o manieră relaxată, jucăuşă şi inteligentă conceptele expuse mai sus.\n\nMai multe detalii pe: www.kidsopia.ro\nLimba: Româna (România, Moldova)"

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy.

Если вам понравилась игра вы сможете приобрести полную версию с 20 темами и 200+ слайдами!\n\nИгра очень проста для ребенка, поможет ему расширить свой кругозор и даже удивить взрослых своими новыми знаниями. Изучать новые слова с Умным Малышом очень просто, для этого нужно выбрать раздел из основного меню нажатием на экран и перейти в тематический раздел с 10 картинками. Каждый слайд озвучен приятным женским голосом, а при нажатии увеличивается на полный экран чтобы было проще рассмотреть изображение. \n\nВ игре есть 2 режима:\n* В режиме интерактивного обучения ваш малыш сможет нажать на изображение интересующиего объекта и диктор назовет его голосом. В каждой теме представлено по 10 слайдов.\n* Во время игры диктор голосом задает вопросы, а ребенок должен найти подходяющую картинку. Если малыш ошибся 3 раза, то диктор покажет правильный ответ. В конце каждой игры обязательное поздравления с летающими воздушными шарами, которые можно лопнуть по нажатию.\n\nС использованием двух режимов ребенок не только изучит, но и закрепит свои знания!\n\nВ игре практически нет текстовых надписей, все управление основано на использовании голоса и картинок. Участие родителя в игре вовсе не обязательно и остается на ваше усмотрение.\n\nПодходит для детей от 2 лет."

Информация дается в сжатом виде, затем методом многократного повторения закрепляется в памяти. \n\nВ короткие сроки вы научитесь правильно строить простые выражения, незаметно для себя выучите много новых слов. \n\nКак проходят занятия\n\nЗанятия проходят в игровой форме. Программа предлагает простое выражение на русском языке. Из английских слов на экране нужно составить правильный ответ. Если вы ответили правильно программа похвалит вас, если вдруг ошиблись – подскажет правильный ответ.\n\nПравильный ответ озвучиваются.\n\nВ любое время можно прочитать теоретический материал или заглянуть в подсказку. Подсказка синхронизирована с заданием. \n\nВ качестве подсказки предлагается таблица спряжения английских глаголов по временам. Отображается тот глагол, который употребляется в задании.\nЗанимаясь в программе, вы попутно выучите основные неправильные глаголы.\n\nМетод хорошо зарекомендовал себя для начинающих изучать английский с нуля и для продолжающих.\n\nСписок уроков:\n\n1. Базовая форма глагола.\n2. Местоимения. Вопросительные слова.\n3. Глагол \"to be\". Предлоги места. Like/Want.\n4. Притяжательные местоимения.\n5. Профессии. Этикет.\n6. Степени сравнения прилагательных. Указательные местоимения.\n7. Слова-параметры. Употребление much и many.\n8. Предлоги и параметры времени.\n9. There is / There are.\n10. Предлоги направления и движения.\n11. Модальные глаголы can, must, should.\n12. Continuous\n13. Прилагательные. Описание людей. Погода\n14. Present Perfect\n15. Повелительное наклонение\n16. Фразовые глаголы\n\nМатериал изучается последовательно. Контроль изучения реализован следующим образом:\n\n• за правильные ответы начисляются баллы\n• без активации доступен один урок\r\n• после активации доступны все уроки по мере набора 4.5 балла в предыдущем\r\n\nАлгоритм начисления баллов:\n\nПрограмма помнит 100 последних ответов, количество ПРАВИЛЬНЫХ ответов делит на 100 и умножает на 5. Чтобы набрать 4.5 балла, надо ответить правильно на 90 вопросов из 100.\n\nАлгоритм расчета баллов позволяет быстро перейти к следующему уроку, если вы знаете тему хорошо, и не позволит этого сделать, если ваших знаний недостаточно.\n\nДля тех, кто хорошо знает язык, в программе реализован режим повышенной сложности (включается в настройках). В сложном режиме ответ требуется ввести с клавиатуры по буквам, а не выбрать из представленных на экране вариантов. То есть надо знать как пишутся английские слова.\n\nПодробнее об этой и других программах для изучения иностранных языков читайте на нашем сайте:\n* http://polyglotmobile.ru/\n\nПрисоединяйтесь к нам ВКонтакте.\n* http://vk.com/polyglotmobile\n\nПолиглотом может стать каждый!"

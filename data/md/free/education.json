      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nIf you need help, have questions, or just want to say, “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games.\n\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\n\nhttp://binibambini.com/privacy\n\nMore about Bini Games:\n\nBini Games is a group of enthusiastic professionals including designers, artists, animators, programmers, and musicians, who love to create digital games for children.\n\nAll our games are safe and do not collect any personal information."

These quizzes will help you in your learning journey and you can test your python knowledge.\n\n This app will teach you not just about Basic to Advanced Python Programming but you will also:\n- Learn Web Development with Python [HTML, CSS, Django, Flask, Pyramid, cherryPy, TurboGears],\n- Learn Artificial Intelligence with Python,\n- Learn Machine Learning,\n- Learn Web Scraping [Beautiful Soup, Web Scraping]\n- Learn Git,\n- Practice with Python Programs in Python Compiler,\nand much much more. By the end, you’ll be a job-ready python programmer.\n\nWhat is Python Exactly?\nPython 3 is a general-purpose language, which means it can be used to build just about anything, which will be made easy with the right tools/libraries.\nProfessionally, Python is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Many developers have also used Python to build productivity tools, games, and desktop apps, so there are plenty of resources to help you learn how to do those as well.\n\nLearn Python Object-Oriented Programming:-\nPython has been an object-oriented language since it existed. Because of this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This app helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.\n\nLearn Django Framework:\nYou will also learn Django and how to develop websites.

This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Django.\n\nLearn Flask Framework:\nYou will also learn Flask and how to develop webistes using it. Flask is a web application framework written in Python. Armin Ronacher, who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco, develops it. Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.\n\nLearn CherryPy:\nCherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This results in smaller source code developed in less time. It is being used in many production websites.\n\nLearn Python Web Scraping:\nWeb scraping, also called web data mining or web harvesting, is the process of constructing an agent that can extract, parse, download, and organize useful information from the web automatically.\n\nSo what are you waiting for!

We craft experiences that are unlike others you have experienced before. \n\n=== Interactive stories\nWe use video to tell stories that are fun, surprising, and memorable. This will help to give context to what you are learning and make building new memories feel effortless.\n\n=== A new type of flashcards\nYou've never seen flashcards like these before. They combine video, speaking practice, and embedded grammar to create a fun and effective learning experience.\n\n=== Active learning through speaking\nRecording audio of your speech and comparing it with that of native speakers allows you to improve your pronunciation. As you practice these improvements, your muscle memory for the language strengthens and speaking becomes effortless.\n\n=== Grammar at your fingertips\nWe are most receptive to learning grammar after we've made a mistake. So, if you make a mistake with a word, simply click it to display detailed grammar information. It's like having a grammar book always ready to tell you what you need to know, when you need to know it.\n\n=== Customize your learning\nUse our vocab trainer to build flashcard decks tailored to specific vocabulary that you want to learn. Each card is pulled from one of our stories and has all of the fun context that will make this vocabulary easy to remember."

      "label": "SuperȘcoala este o platformă educațională care oferă elevilor materiile școlare explicate în lecții video, ajutându-i pe copii să învețe mai ușor noțiunile, să își consolideze cunoștințele, să aibă rezultate școlare mai bune și să fie mai pregătiți pentru examene. \n\nLa fel cum pe alte platforme de streaming se pot viziona filme, pe SuperȘcoala copiii au la dispoziție lecții de matematică, limba română și limba engleză, toate în format video și în conformitate cu programa școlară în vigoare. În plus, punem la dispoziție fișe de lucru cu rezolvări pentru verificare, joculețe interactive pentru exersare și o secțiune de întrebări și răspunsuri după fiecare lecție, pentru a putea cere sau oferi ajutorul la anumite exerciții.\n\nSuperȘcoala oferă educație, iar educația are impact pozitiv în viața fiecăruia. Atunci când este de calitate, educația primită de către copii în anii de școală construiește o bază solidă, pe care apoi pot clădi orice doresc și li se potrivește. Cu o mai bună educație ei au mai multe șanse de a reuși, mai multe oportunități, pornind de la un liceu bun, o facultate sau o altă formă de învățământ, mergând până la venituri mai mari și o viață mai fericită.\n\nNe dorim ca, prin platforma noastră, orice copil să primească șansa de a învăța fără să depindă strict de cunoștințele și calitățile didactice ale profesorului de la clasă, nici de răbdarea sau posibilitățile financiare ale familiei. Părinții sunt de multe ori nevoiți să se transforme în profesori de ocazie sau să apeleze foarte devreme la meditații, în special la materiile de bază, pentru că altfel copilul rămâne cu lacune care, în timp, devin din ce în ce mai greu de acoperit.\n\nCu ajutorul SuperȘcoala orice copil din orice școală  poate învăța într-un mod foarte bine structurat și plăcut, uneori amuzant, de la unii dintre cei mai buni profesori din România, care te fac să îndrăgești materia și nu își pierd niciodată răbdarea – nu pentru că nu sunt și ei oameni, dar pentru că lecțiile sunt pre-înregistrate și disponibile oricând, putând fi și reluate de câte ori este nevoie.\n\nLa școală, un profesor bun poate face diferența între a-i face pe copii să urmărească și să înțeleagă, poate chiar să iubească materia, sau nu. Doar că nu toți elevii sunt atât de norocoși încât să nimerească la școală, la toate materiile, unii dintre cei mai buni și mai dedicați pedagogi, așa cum toți ni i-am dori pentru copiii noștri. SuperȘcoala aduce acești profesori de excepție și conținut de calitate, structurat și gândit în conformitate cu programa școlară."

      "label": "Learn French with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the French language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core French words, form sentences, learn to speak French phrases and take part in conversations. Fun French lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule?\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own French language tutor in your pocket.\nDownload the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the French language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of French grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right French pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your French words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak French clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning French. Mondly teaches you French vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational French. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core French vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak French clearly.\n\n• Advanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these French lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language."

      "label": "ABC Trenul Alfabet este abecedarul interactiv pentru copii preșcolari de la 2 la 7 ani.\nVarianta gratuită a jocului oferă accesul la primele 12 litere mari și mici ale alfabetului limbii române urmând ca, dacă micuțului îi face plăcere să mai învețe, să achiziționați în interiorul aplicației restul de litere din alfabet.\n\n ● Vagonul Arheologului\nCopiii vor descoperi alfabetul limbii române din primul vagon al Trenului Alfabet, alături de arheologul Ordovicius Priscoan, un personaj plin de umor și dorința de a \"dezgropa\" lucruri noi alături de micuți. \nCopiii vor învăța următoarele:\n  - să denumească literele ajutându-l pe arheolog să curețe artefacte antice\n  - să formeze litere recunoscându-le astfel forma lucrând în atelierul arheologului la reparaţii de obiecte istorice\n  - să recunoască litere în vasta bibliotecă de papirusuri pusă la dispoziția micuților de către Ordovicius\n\nVagonul Arheologului este disponibil în Română, Engleză, Spaniolă și Germană.\n\n ● Vagonul Roboților\nÎn cel de al doilea vagon micuții se vor întâlni cu cei trei frați roboți creatori de reclame luminoase. Alături de Steambot, Dieselbot și Electrobot copiii vor învăța procese tehnologice distractive și, fără să își dea seama, vor ști cum se scriu literele.\n  - Steambot le va arăta copiilor care sunt vectorii de scriere trasând și tăind litere în plăci mari de tablă. Una câte una ele vor fi pregătite pentru următorul proces tehnologic.\n  - literele proaspăt tăiate vor ajunge la robotul Dieselbot unde vor fi șlefuite pentru a arăta minunat. Copiii îl vor ajuta pe acesta să obțină cele mai strălucitoare litere din alfabet desenând după ghid fiecare literă în parte.\n  - totul va culmina cu atelierul lui Electrobot: aici micuții vor învăța cum se trasează liber literele ajutându-l pe electricianul vagonului să pună fire, fasunguri și neoane ce vor lumina feeric!\n\nVagonul Roboților este disponibil în limba Română.\n\nEvoluția le va fi răsplătită cu animații minunate, cu pârâieli și pufneli distractive pentru ca cei mici să nu își dea seama cât de mult au învățat cu adevărat! Obosiți dar fericiți își vor vedea operele strălucind pe acoperișuri celebre din toată lumea.\n\nÎn curând alte vagoane ale trenului vor fi adăugate pentru ca micuții să se distreze învățând să formeze cuvinte, să descopere litere în contextul cuvintelor, să recunoască auzind literele în cadrul unui cuvânt, să citească cuvinte și mai apoi să își surprindă părinții învățând cum scriu literele!\n\nVă place jocul nostru? Dacă da, daţi-ne un rating!\n\nKidsopia oferă o gamă largă de jocuri distractive şi modalităţi creative de a învăţa copilul lucruri noi.\nPlatforma Kidsopia este perfectă pentru micuţii de 2 şi 3 ani, pentru copii de grădiniţă (de la 4 la 5 ani) şi pentru cei care abia acum încep şcoala (6 şi 7 ani), prezentându-le multe din ideile de bază şi noţiunile pe care un copil trebuie să le înţeleagă şi să le stăpânească corect.\nKidsopia este o platformă educaţională bazată pe studiul UNICEF: “Repere Fundamentale pentru Învăţarea Timpurie a Copilului de la Naştere până la 7 ani” (RFIDT).\n\nDorim să oferim o cale amuzantă şi intuitivă de a învăţa cifrele, număratul şi literele, desenatul şi coloratul, mărimi, forme şi imagini, diferenţe şi asemănări, animale şi multe altele, toate prezentate prin intermediul jocurilor şi poveştilor noastre.\n\nCu ajutorul platformei Kidsopia copilul va trece printr-un proces constând în 3 etape:\n\n1. Acumularea şi înţelegerea noilor concepte. \n2. Fundamentarea acestor noţiuni prin procesul de exersare. \n3. Dezvoltarea capacităţii de a recunoaşte, asocia şi aplica aceste noi informaţii.\n\nScopul aplicaţiilor din Kidsopia este ca cei mici să înveţe într-o manieră relaxată, jucăuşă şi inteligentă conceptele expuse mai sus.\n\nMai multe detalii pe: www.kidsopia.ro"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado.

      "label": "Всего за несколько минут в день вы научитесь составлять предложения на английском.\n\nМы специально оптимизировали уроки для мобильных устройств. Информация дается в сжатом виде, затем методом многократного повторения закрепляется в памяти. \n\nВ короткие сроки вы научитесь правильно строить простые выражения, незаметно для себя выучите много новых слов. \n\nКак проходят занятия\n\nЗанятия проходят в игровой форме. Программа предлагает простое выражение на русском языке. Из английских слов на экране нужно составить правильный ответ. Если вы ответили правильно программа похвалит вас, если вдруг ошиблись – подскажет правильный ответ.\n\nПравильный ответ озвучиваются.\n\nВ любое время можно прочитать теоретический материал или заглянуть в подсказку. Подсказка синхронизирована с заданием. \n\nВ качестве подсказки предлагается таблица спряжения английских глаголов по временам. Отображается тот глагол, который употребляется в задании.\nЗанимаясь в программе, вы попутно выучите основные неправильные глаголы.\n\nМетод хорошо зарекомендовал себя для начинающих изучать английский с нуля и для продолжающих.\n\nСписок уроков:\n\n1. Базовая форма глагола.\n2. Местоимения. Вопросительные слова.\n3. Глагол \"to be\". Предлоги места. Like/Want.\n4. Притяжательные местоимения.\n5. Профессии. Этикет.\n6. Степени сравнения прилагательных. Указательные местоимения.\n7. Слова-параметры. Употребление much и many.\n8. Предлоги и параметры времени.\n9. There is / There are.\n10. Предлоги направления и движения.\n11. Модальные глаголы can, must, should.\n12. Continuous\n13. Прилагательные. Описание людей. Погода\n14. Present Perfect\n15. Повелительное наклонение\n16. Фразовые глаголы\n\nМатериал изучается последовательно. Контроль изучения реализован следующим образом:\n\n• за правильные ответы начисляются баллы\n• без активации доступен один урок\r\n• после активации доступны все уроки по мере набора 4.5 балла в предыдущем\r\n\nАлгоритм начисления баллов:\n\nПрограмма помнит 100 последних ответов, количество ПРАВИЛЬНЫХ ответов делит на 100 и умножает на 5. Чтобы набрать 4.5 балла, надо ответить правильно на 90 вопросов из 100.\n\nАлгоритм расчета баллов позволяет быстро перейти к следующему уроку, если вы знаете тему хорошо, и не позволит этого сделать, если ваших знаний недостаточно.\n\nДля тех, кто хорошо знает язык, в программе реализован режим повышенной сложности (включается в настройках). В сложном режиме ответ требуется ввести с клавиатуры по буквам, а не выбрать из представленных на экране вариантов. То есть надо знать как пишутся английские слова.\n\nПодробнее об этой и других программах для изучения иностранных языков читайте на нашем сайте:\n* http://polyglotmobile.ru/\n\nПрисоединяйтесь к нам ВКонтакте.\n* http://vk.com/polyglotmobile\n\nПолиглотом может стать каждый!"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

It’s so much easier to edit your home screen with so many ideas. I wish they could add widgets that come with it. I told all my friends to get it it’s soooo good. Overall it’s the best app i’ve found so far to make your home screen aesthetic.\n\n\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nPREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION (weekly or annual subscription):\n- Get access to all the features\n- Get premium content updates\n- No ads\n\n\n\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- The account​ will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nYou can read our Privacy policy and Terms of Use at https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/50448913 https://www.iubenda.com/terms-and-conditions/50448913"

Our first-ever built-in Virtual Stylus gives you all the freedom and power to make effortless, beautiful designs on your device by allowing you to see exactly where you're drawing and helping you accomplish tasks in tight spaces on the canvas. We take your freehand drawing to the next level with smart guides for stable, precise strokes, and the app auto connects to other strokes so you can freely lift your pen and seamlessly resume drawing on the same path. \n\nGET GRADIENT AND COLORFUL\nThe Gradient Tool and Color Picker give brilliant, vibrant, or dramatic life to your design. We offer multiple color pickers to choose from, including wheel, RGB, HSB, hex board, and palettes. You can also view linear and radial gradient styles and add and delete gradient stops.\n\nCOLOR PALETTES\nDive into an endless rainbow with never-ending color palettes. Vector Logo Designer comes with an overflowing, radiant library of color palettes and a color palette generator, so you never have to sacrifice on color combinations. Add an infinite number of colors to a palette, and we'll automatically generate colors that compliment your choices and then save your custom color palette to use in other projects. You can also upload photos and convert the image colors into a custom color palette.\n\nVECTOR ADVANTAGE\nTry out smart vector features that effortlessly elevate your logo design to professional standards. Use the Vector Pen Tool, vector Boolean functions, convert text to an editable vector path, convert stroke outlines to an editable vector path, and much more. \n\nLAYER LIKE A PRO\nLayer like a pro and take complete control of your logo design project.

      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

Plus, with CorelCAD Mobile you can edit a drawing* and then immediately share the modified version.\n\nOn-site annotation\nAdd, change or edit important project details on-site, such as confirming measurements, revising key data or including text notes. With the unique annotation features, PictureNote* and VoiceNote*, you can take a picture from the camera of your mobile device or record your voice and pin the recorded note to the right place in your drawing.\n\nInstant modifications\nFind all the tools you need to make immediate changes or fixes with the 150+ drawing and editing features* in CorelCAD Mobile. The 2D tools will help you create or modify your drawing* within an interface that’s been optimized for touch and high precision.\n\nSketch ideas*\nOriginate or capture ideas the moment the inspiration strikes in any global location. CorelCAD Mobile is the natural extension of CorelCAD for your mobile devices. Plus, you’ll find all the familiar tools you’re used to seeing on your computer, with the exception of a few touch gestures, so there’s no learning curve.\n\n*These features, 2D drawing, 2D editing, advanced annotation tools, such as VoiceNote, PictureNote, and command list, are only available in the “Full mode” app and require a subscription.\nSubscription options are available as monthly or annual subscription which can be purchased in the CorelCAD Mobile app on iTunes.\n\nSubscriptions will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account. Subscriptions are automatically renewed unless cancelled at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to cancel a subscription during the active period. Manage your subscriptions in your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.corel.com/tos"

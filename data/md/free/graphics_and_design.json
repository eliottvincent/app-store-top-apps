It can be loaded from the device memory, as well as download the basic stencils available inside the application. The program will automatically position the sketch on the canvas, while giving you the opportunity to change the image parameters. The picture can be rotated, enlarged or made transparent using the corresponding sliders located at the bottom of the screen.\n\nPainter Eye: Canvas Creator has rich set of sketching features. You can change the color and drawing style of the sketch, turn it into a monochrome copy, or convert fresh photos into a stencil. Pictures of any quality can be placed on the entire space of the canvas and sequentially draw complex elements. You can even turn his own portrait into a sketch, having previously loaded it from the smartphone's memory.\n\nTerms of Use - https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy - https://www.appodeal.com/home/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

      "label": "Color Gear is a handy tool that helps to create harmonious color swatches. To find the right color combination, designers and artists use color theory and the basis of it: color wheels and harmonies. Or maybe you have just started to learn the basics of color science and you need a simple app to study the color harmony in practice.\n\nUse color wheel that suits your needs\nOur app supports two color models — Full Color Wheel (RGB model) and Basic Itten's Color Wheel. Color scheme by Itten is typically used by artists, and RGB is designed for online use. For both of them you can apply one of the 10 color combinations \\ harmonies.\n\nAbility to extract colors from your image\nSelect the desired picture from your phone and application's algorithms will extract colors. Then  you can choose favorite colors and save the palette.\n\nGet matching colors to your custom color\nJust type in your color code and discover color harmonies with this particular color.\n\nUse color editing tool\nIt is very important to balance the quantitative ratio of color in order to make your palette look harmonious in practice. The application has a convenient function to quickly swap colors in the images. There are 3 pictures and gradient in the palette editing carousel. You can see how the selected colors look in different ratios. \n\nEasy to manage and share\nAlso you will be able to save, export and remove palettes. To share the desired palette just choose mode — text HEX codes or image. You can always copy a particular color code under color swatch to the clipboard.\n\nDeveloping Color Gear we tried to make it professional and easy to use. Two color circles, 10 color harmonies, ability to input a color code manually, and convenient palette editing tool that are always at hand in one application."

The visual experience is far beyond photo or video demonstrations.\n\nMove your mobile device just like you would do with a real test panel in hands. Assess the color travel of the effect pigments during flop movement. Investigate the hiding properties of products by observing applications over black and white substrates. See the color pigments acting in an aluminum reduction. \n\nSearch the pigments of your choice by use of the multiple filters offering many industry-relevant criteria. Group and save your personal pigment collections. Gain visually the interactive appearance impression and compare your products of interest side by side, as you are used to. Obtain the technical data, and the coloristic behavior plotted in convenient professional diagrams. \n\n\n\nFeatures\n- virtual fandeck for pigments of Colors & Effects\n- effect and color pigments, mainly for coatings\n- gyro-controlled interactive viewer\n- images by high quality digital rendering\n- side-by-side inspection of appearance\n- various pigment application types\n- industry-relevant filters, personalized\n- custom-made lists of bookmark \n- quick collection My list\n- login to Colors & Effects account\n- extensive product data, TDS via login\n- professional color data diagrams\n- storage management\n- detailed instructions\n- easy, self-evident navigation\n\n\n\nQuick start guide \n\nFor deeper instructions and information use the 3-dots-menu in the app to get to \"Settings\", then click \"Usage Instructions\"\n\nThe app requires internet connection to access the Colors & Effects pigments database.\n\nThe app is structured into three main windows. Imagine them to be ordered side by side:\n\nFilters  -  Lists  -  Viewer\n\nYou can move between these main windows by swiping, or use the arrow buttons alternatively.\n\nThe filtering result is given in the list \"Products\". Use the lists to select and download pigments, that you want to get displayed in the gyro-controlled \"Viewer\" window. \n\nEnjoy assessing the comparative appearance of two pigments under the varying illumination and observation conditions that you simulate by tilting your device with your arm – like you do in the real world!\n\nNumerical facts? Being in the \"Viewer\" open the data list and the diagram sub-windows.\n\n\n\nBackground: Imaging technology\n\nThe visual representation of the appearance in PigmentViewer is produced by digital rendering using virtual material data. Data were taken gonio- and wavelength-dependent by appearance scanners for a most accurate representation of the optical behavior.\n\nThe visual appearance is presented dynamically by displaying the optical variation that is caused by a virtual mechanical tilting movement of the sample under a fixed illumination. For the visual representation we use a stack of 40 images. Each image is digitally rendered based on the material data and one position in a sequence of tilt angles. The virtual tilting of the sample plane covers an angular up and down turn of approximately 60° and is synchronized with the gyro sensor of the device. The geometrical sequence is set to vary from (close to) perpendicular irradiation and observation (\"face angle\") down to inclined irradiation and observation (\"flop angle\").\n\nThe texture size in the representation of simulated effect applications is scaled to be close to realism on a typical mobile phone monitor (6 inch)."

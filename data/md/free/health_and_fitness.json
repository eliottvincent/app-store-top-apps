In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Meditations improve mood and relieve stress, while affirmations form a new way of thinking, help you gain confidence and achieve happiness in life.\r\n\r\n— We have created a special media player for working with affirmations. It allows you to properly work with a positive attitude.\r\n\r\n— All practices are divided into categories according to their corresponding area of life: sleep, abundance, success, love, energy, health, etc. Choose what you want to make of your life.\r\n\r\n— At the first launch, the Mentor will ask for your name, birthdate, and gender. All these are important factors in shaping a person's destiny. Then, we will use the stars to determine your character, strengths, and energy level and offer a personalized selection of affirmations.\r\n\r\nUsing the app every day will gradually change your way of thinking and build a solid path from your desires and goals to their earliest possible realization.\r\n\r\nThe app requires access to a microphone and speech recognition functions to work correctly.\r\n\r\nPrivacy policy: https://mentorhd.com/policy\r\nTerms of use: https://mentorhd.com/agreement"

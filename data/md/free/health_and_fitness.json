      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Эта программа для женщин. С ее помощью Вы легко сможете контролировать свои менструальные циклы. Программа постоянно будет анализировать Ваши предыдущие месячные и на их основе строить прогнозы начала следующих циклов. В программу заложены алгоритмы для прогноза дня овуляции и фертильных дней. \n\n- Одной из отличительных особенностей этой программы от аналогичных является встроенный дневник, в который Вы сможете заносить не только свои недомогания, заметки, температуру, вес, но и свои фотографии.\n\n- Специальный планировщик приема лекарств, который интегрирован в дневник, поможет Вам легко сформировать график их приема на каждый день. \n\n\n- В дневнике к любому дню можно прикреплять результаты анализов в виде фотографий и файлов PDF. Если у Вас несколько фотографий одного анализа - не страшно. В программу встроен инструмент объединения фотографий в единый PDF документ. Используя поисковый фильтр Вы легко сможете получить список только тех или иных анализов и быстро их просмотреть. Любой из прикрепленных документов можно отправить по почте или через MMS. Т.о. на период беременности программа может выполнять еще и функцию базы данных Ваших анализов.\n\n- Если отметить в программе начало одной из семи вариантов диет,  то программа начнет  отображать ежедневное меню этой диеты в разделе Расписание на день\n\n- Встроенный в программу механизм напоминаний не даст Вам пропустить прием лекарств или любой другой, Важный для Вас момент. \n\n- Внесенный в дневник вес всегда можно посмотреть на отдельном графике, внесенная температура позволит построить график температуры, например, для выявления дня овуляции \n\n- Раздел \"Расписание на день\" покажет внутри дня напоминания, расписание приема лекарств и меню завтрака, обеда и ужина (а также полдника, второго завтрака) в зависимости от выбранной Вами диеты.\n\n- В программу встроена постоянно пополняемая подборка познавательных роликов с YouTube и подборка текстовой информации по женским циклам, недомоганиям, беременности и т.д.\n\n- Любой из разделов можно обсудить с десятками тысячами других пользователей перейдя на внутренний форум. Не нужно заводить новую учетную запись. Вы можете воспользоваться одним из своих аккаунтов в Facebook, Вконтакте, Одноклассниках, Google+ или Mail.Ru.\n\n- Программа позволяет формировать красочный отчет в формате PDF с фотографиями на основе данных заведенных в дневник.\n\n- Есть возможность установить пароль на вход в программу для защиты личной информации\n\n- Программа поддерживает синхронизацию данных через ICloud, которая сохранит Ваши данные в облаке и позволит легко переносить их на другие устройства\n\n- Изменив задний фон программы Вы сможете полностью видоизменить ее внешний вид подстроив под свое настроение."

      "label": "'Methylisothiazolinone' but what is that ?\n\nSavonnette is still not installed on your phone? QUICK QUICK QUICK ! Savonnette is there to help you understand your consumption of cosmetic products and offer you better and cleaner products for your body health and our planet's health thanks to a scan, statistics and a virtual beauty box.\n\n\nDo you want to know more about Savonnette? Here are some of the features of the application:\n\n- Your closet: If you want to understand the products composition that compose your bathroom cupboards, you just have to scan them and then save them in your closet. You can do as many as you want! This will then allow you to have statistics in order to know your consumption of harmful ingredients, follow your progress more easily and tend towards a cleaner, greener consumption, for your body heath and for our planet\n\n- A virtual beauty box: You will regularly discover, in this box, cosmetics from responsible brands that offer cleaner products that are better for your body health and for our planet. All the compositions are decrypted even in this box\n\n- A scanner to allow you to scan your cosmetic products in order to know everything about them, to know their origin: The composition, the dangerousness of the ingredients for your body health and for our planet, their origin, their function, their frequency of use. I'm also trying to teach you a little more about the composition to know how to decrypt them more easily, to act cleaner. And if you don't have the product to scan it, you can always search manually and have access to its composition.\n\n- A history: You will find there all the scans that you have done or the products that you have consulted. If you have a crush on a cleaner product just add it to favorites.\n\n- Access to all features anonymously: No account needed! And thanks to a QRcode you will always have access to your favorite products, your history, your box, your closets.\n\nAt Savonnette we want to support you towards more responsible consumption: consumption that allows you to pay attention to the health of your body but also to the health of the planet. Let me explain: In a world where we swim in information flows, where time is precious and where our body health and our planet health are most important, we want, thanks to all this information, to propose the most suitable and appropriate cosmetic products.\n\nSo do you want to participate in your well-being ?

      "label": "Приложение от MedAboutMe «Бросить курить» создано специально для тех, кто хочет жить здоровой, полноценной жизнью, дышать свежим воздухом и навсегда забыть о табачном дыме. \n\nТест на определение уровня зависимости от сигарет\nПервым делом необходимо пройти специальный тест, который определит, насколько сильна у человека зависимость от табака и, следовательно, насколько легко или сложно ему будет отказаться от сигарет. В тесте представлены вопросы, касающиеся ежедневной жизни человека: как часто он берет в руки сигарету, какие ситуации этому способствуют. \n\nСтатистика\nДля тех, кто решился бросить курить, в приложении создана специальная система счетчиков. Достаточно ввести дату, с которой пользователь решил отказаться от курения, количество сигарет, которое он выкуривал в день, стоимость пачки, а также содержание вредных веществ – и главный экран всегда будет показывать статистику сэкономленного здоровья и денег. Приложение будет напоминать о ваших заслугах перед собой и своим организмом, в нем приготовлены награды, которые будут отмечать каждый пройденный вами этап. Ими можно будет делиться в социальных сетях с друзьями – пусть они поддерживают вас и берут с вас пример!\n\nПолезные советы\nВ разделе советов человек, который решил бросить курить сигареты, может найти полезную информацию, как ему легче всего будет это сделать. Чем занять себя, чтобы не думать о сигаретах, что лучше есть, какой режим лучше соблюдать – и еще много советов, которые пригодятся бросающим курить. Кто информирован, тот вооружен! И пользователи приложения будут вооружены в своей борьбе с курением.\n\nФакты из жизни знаменитых курильщиков\nВ этом разделе – примеры из жизни знаменитостей, которые курили и бросали курить. А те, кто не бросал, как правило, жалели о том, что не расстались с этой привычкой, пока еще были здоровы. Среди звездных курильщиков – российские и зарубежные актеры, певцы, писатели и бизнесмены.\n\nТехника постепенного отказа от курения\nЕе могут использовать те, для кого резкий отказ от курения не подходит. Или те, кто попробовал бросить и сорвался. Приложение предлагает 6 простых шагов, которые помогут постепенно уменьшать количество потребляемого табака и снижать тягу к никотину, чтобы, в конце концов, совсем отказаться от сигарет.\n\nТревога\nВ этом разделе можно получить помощь, если чувствуешь, что на грани срыва, или в случае, когда смалодушничал и сорвался. Однократный срыв не означает, что от идеи бросить курить нужно отказаться. Терапевты и психологи, работающие в школах по отказу от курения и кабинетах психологической поддержки, помогут и тем, кому отказ дается нелегко, и тем, кто закурил снова.\n\nПриложение от MedAboutMe «Бросить курить» – это отличный помощник для тех, кто хочет раз и навсегда завязать с этой пагубной привычкой, но не знает как."

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

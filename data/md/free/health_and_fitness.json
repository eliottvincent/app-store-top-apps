      "label": "Splits Training is designed for all levels to get full splits step by step, even if you are a beginner. The mixing of static and dynamic splits helps you improve flexibility effectively and achieve results faster than you think. With just 10 min a day, you’ll get closer and closer to the floor!\n\nProductive stretches for splits in 30 days are suitable for men and women, adults and kids. You can customize your splits training based on your own preferences, no equipment needed.\n\nWhether you want to do a full split for dance, ballet, gymnastics or martial arts, this training will help you get there.\n\nWhy splits?\nSplits have been proven to prevent injuries, increase muscle strength, relieve muscle stiffness and give you better circulation.\n\nImprove your flexibility & balance\nFlexibility and balance are key to reducing the risk of injury during exercise. Splits stretch all your lower body muscles to increase your range of motion.\n\nLoosen your hip flexors\nDue to sitting at a desk all day, most people have extremely tight hip flexors, which can cause pain, especially in your lower back. Splits open up these areas to relieve your muscle tension.\n\nDeeply stretch your legs\nWhen doing splits, your legs will be stretching the whole time. We recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you’re doing activities such as running or biking.\n\nPlease get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits. Splits need time; your muscles need time to stretch, recover and adapt to the new demands. Be patient, and stick to it; you’ll soon see progress.\n\nFeatures\n- Splits for all levels, splits for beginners, splits for men, splits for women, splits for kids\n- Step-by-step directions on how to do the splits for all levels\n- Effective formula to help achieve results fast\n- Splits in 30 days\n- Customize your own training plan\n- Easy-to-follow instruction, animation and video guide\n- Record your progress automatically\n- Stretches for splits target all muscles you need to become super flexible\n- Sync data to Apple Health\n\nCoach\nThis app is just like your personal fitness coach.

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "Despite simplicity, I’ve managed to produce a fully functional Fitness Journal for workout logging and planning: with calendar and statistics. Gym Record works completely offline and has no excess functions at all. I’ve honestly tried my best to make it nice & simple. My biggest pride is intuitive & clean interface.\n\nThe app is great both for home & gym training because the list of exercises is determined by the user. Instead of hundreds of pre-installed workout programs (easy to get lost in), you design a database yourself — save just what you need, nothing extra.\n\n‣ Create and customise exercises: from yoga to strength training.\n‣ Group them in supersets.\n‣ Log your workouts in a few taps.\n‣ Watch your progress: gain mass, lose weight or just be toned. \n\nIn order to achieve minimalism, I’ve excluded as many elements and functions as possible. However, if you are missing something be sure to contact me via www.gymrecord.app, so that we can improve the app and make it better together. At the moment I am working on the following features:\n\n‣ iCloud backup\n‣ More statistics\n\nThe only limitation of the free version is the maximum amount of 8 workouts. You can ignore this limit, simply delete some old workouts from calendar to free up the space. Or you can go for a premium subscription, the price of which is comparable to the cost of a cup of coffee. This support, as well as an honest review, helps me to develop my project. I promise not to embed any in-app ads or extra purchases, I use Gym Record myself and want it to be perfectly nice, clean and useful.\n\nPrivacy: https://www.gymrecord.app/privacy-policy\nTerms: https://www.gymrecord.app/terms-of-use"

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in.

Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking.

Our DNA Health profile reports on 5 core health areas:\n\n•       Physical – Uncover your genetic muscle power, anaerobic threshold and many more reports based on your physiology.\n•\tDiet – Get to know, among other things, how your body responds to carbohydrates and what your metabolic rate really is. \n•\tVitamins – It could be critical to know if you have a deficiency to certain vitamins and minerals; now you can find out!\n•\tHealth – Are you at risk of obesity or Type 2 diabetes? Put into place interventions against genetic health risks.\n•\tPsychology – Discover if you’re a Warrior or a Worrier with expert recommendations concerning how you could deal with certain situations.\n\nHealth Insights\n\nDelving further into your genetics, we delivers deep insights to help you with :\n\n•      Stress - Valuable insight into the relation of our genes and our ability to manage stress.\n•\tAnti-Ageing – Ageing is the biggest risk factor associated with disease.\n•\tSleep management – Sleep allows the repair of bone, skin and muscles and is    responsible for the correct functioning of the immune system.\n•\tInjury Prevention – Help minimise the risk of injury.\n•\tMental Health – Reports on genetic variants that play a part in mind health.\n•\tGut Health – A healthy gut is the base of wellness.\n•\tMuscle Health – Healthy muscles are needed to function in everyday life.\n•\tEye Health – How well do you process the nutrients needed for good eye health?\n•\tSkin Health - Your skin could be genetically predisposed to certain health risks.\n\nBiological Age & Epigenetic Health Profile\n\nEpigenetics controls how your genes behave. You are born with your genetic makeup, but you can affect your epigenetics through your lifestyle. \nWhat is Biological Age?\n\nWe actually have two ages: Chronological age and biological age.\nYour chronological age is the exact number of years that you have been alive. Whereas your biological age is the true reflection of how your cells are ageing. \n\nEpigenetics Reports\n\n Epigenetics test looks at your:\n•\tBiological Age\n•\tEye Age\n•\tMemory Age\n•\tHearing Age\n•\tInflammation\n\nBenefit from knowing if you should make any changes in your nutrition, exercise or lifestyle or continue to monitor your overall health. The app provides the insights together with real world expert recommendations that you can take away with you.\n\nMultiple Tests\n\nAs you can affect your epigenetics it means that you are now able to track your genetic health. Multiple testing allows you to monitor how positive changes are affecting your inner health.

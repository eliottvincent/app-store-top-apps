The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

      "label": "«Счетчик калорий и дневник питания» – это больше, чем таблица калорийности всех продуктов. Это отличный способ следить за весом и питанием бесплатно, благодаря возможности рассчитать калории продуктов и калорийность готовых блюд вашего рациона.\n\nПриложение «Счетчик калорий и дневник питания» поможет определить ваш индекс массы тела, и с учетом вашего уровня активности, на основе поставленной цели, сделает подсчет калорий и воды необходимый именно вам. Встроенный калькулятор калорий облегчит ежедневный подсчет калорий продуктов (ккал), которые вы потребили и всегда даст знать, что суточная норма калорий превышена. Чего не способна сделать обычная таблица калорийности продуктов, где нужно считать калории вручную. При необходимости вы всегда можете добавить продукты питания или блюдо, которое не удалось найти в уже существующей базе продуктов. Кроме стандартного калькулятора калорий в приложении есть калькулятор калорий готовых блюд, что позволяет без труда рассчитать калорийность блюд, которые вы готовите сами.\n\nВ настройках приложения в любое время можно поменять свои параметры и цели, а также установить суточную норму калорий (ккал) и воды вручную, отключив калькулятор калорий и воды. Если у вас еще нет привычки пить воду в течение дня, то на помощь придет функция «напоминания». Установите необходимый интервал напоминаний и приложение вас оповестит, что пора попить водички. Так вам будет легче сформировать полезную привычку пить воду в течение дня. Так же можно установить напоминания о приеме пищи.\n\nИспользуете вы дневник питания для похудения или для набора веса это всегда практично и удобно. Все что вам нужно это просто скачать счетчик калорий бесплатно и все – универсальный дневник калорийности у вас всегда под рукой. Следить за питанием с приложением «Счетчик калорий и дневник питания» одно удовольствие. А возможность использовать дневник питания бесплатно, делает его доступным для каждого.\nВсе расчеты в приложении являются приближенными. Перед использованием проконсультируйтесь со своим врачом."

      "label": "Would you like to lose weight quickly and effectively without sports and exhausting diets? Then, an intermittent fasting tracker is what you need!\n\nIntermittent fasting is a style of eating for weight loss. It is based on periodical refuse to eat. There are many plans for intermittent fasting. The most popular method is the 16:8 system - skipping food for 16 hours and 8 hours when you can eat. Eating this way makes your body burn fat efficiently.\n\nThe main advantage of fasting is that you don't have to give up your favorite food, it will be enough to skip breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Emotionally, this is much easier than, for example, fasting days on juices. In addition, there are no restrictions on products, which means that you can afford small weaknesses: desserts, fried food, bread, pastries.\n\nOur app is specifically designed to make your intermittent fasting as comfortable as possible. All you need to do is to fill in your details and choose the fasting plan that suits you best. The rest will be done by our application. It will send you a notification when to start fasting and when to indulge in food. The app will graph your weight loss and calculate your body mass index. Tracking your weight loss progress has never been easier.\n\nA simple and intuitive interface will make the process of your weight loss fun. Our widget will show you all the information you need about the current status right on your iPhone desktop.\n\nWhy is intermittent fasting so effective?\nA 16-hour refusal to eat optimizes insulin secretion, and this makes the body less sensitive to carbohydrates with a high glycemic index and reduces hunger. In moments of starvation, your body begins to burn fat reserves without being distracted by food processing. Moreover, an empty stomach can \"rest\", it boosts immunity. Some nutritionists are sure that this principle of nutrition reduces inflammatory processes in the body, regulates blood sugar levels, and improves mental function.\n\nFasting schedule (plans)\nGentle – 12:12 | 13:11 | 14:10\nModerate – 15:9 | 16:8 | 17:7\nIntense – 18:6 | 19:5 | 20:4\n\nIntegrate with the health app (HealthKit) to read and track your steps data and show them in a beautiful way.\n\n\nYou need to believe in yourself and move forward.\nEverything is achievable!"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "Эта программа для женщин. С ее помощью Вы легко сможете контролировать свои менструальные циклы. Программа постоянно будет анализировать Ваши предыдущие месячные и на их основе строить прогнозы начала следующих циклов. В программу заложены алгоритмы для прогноза дня овуляции и фертильных дней. \n\n- Одной из отличительных особенностей этой программы от аналогичных является встроенный дневник, в который Вы сможете заносить не только свои недомогания, заметки, температуру, вес, но и свои фотографии.\n\n- Специальный планировщик приема лекарств, который интегрирован в дневник, поможет Вам легко сформировать график их приема на каждый день. \n\n\n- В дневнике к любому дню можно прикреплять результаты анализов в виде фотографий и файлов PDF. Если у Вас несколько фотографий одного анализа - не страшно. В программу встроен инструмент объединения фотографий в единый PDF документ. Используя поисковый фильтр Вы легко сможете получить список только тех или иных анализов и быстро их просмотреть. Любой из прикрепленных документов можно отправить по почте или через MMS. Т.о. на период беременности программа может выполнять еще и функцию базы данных Ваших анализов.\n\n- Если отметить в программе начало одной из семи вариантов диет,  то программа начнет  отображать ежедневное меню этой диеты в разделе Расписание на день\n\n- Встроенный в программу механизм напоминаний не даст Вам пропустить прием лекарств или любой другой, Важный для Вас момент. \n\n- Внесенный в дневник вес всегда можно посмотреть на отдельном графике, внесенная температура позволит построить график температуры, например, для выявления дня овуляции \n\n- Раздел \"Расписание на день\" покажет внутри дня напоминания, расписание приема лекарств и меню завтрака, обеда и ужина (а также полдника, второго завтрака) в зависимости от выбранной Вами диеты.\n\n- В программу встроена постоянно пополняемая подборка познавательных роликов с YouTube и подборка текстовой информации по женским циклам, недомоганиям, беременности и т.д.\n\n- Любой из разделов можно обсудить с десятками тысячами других пользователей перейдя на внутренний форум. Не нужно заводить новую учетную запись. Вы можете воспользоваться одним из своих аккаунтов в Facebook, Вконтакте, Одноклассниках, Google+ или Mail.Ru.\n\n- Программа позволяет формировать красочный отчет в формате PDF с фотографиями на основе данных заведенных в дневник.\n\n- Есть возможность установить пароль на вход в программу для защиты личной информации\n\n- Программа поддерживает синхронизацию данных через ICloud, которая сохранит Ваши данные в облаке и позволит легко переносить их на другие устройства\n\n- Изменив задний фон программы Вы сможете полностью видоизменить ее внешний вид подстроив под свое настроение."

      "label": "Face yoga, or facial exercises, work by strengthening specific muscle groups to keep the skin on top plump and firm. Reduce wrinkles and get rid of headaches? Seems like the perfect solution! In addition, a study published last year found that facial exercises can even improve your mental health. \r\n\r\nAs you get older, facial muscles will naturally begin to lose elasticity and flexibility, which leads to wrinkles and a saggy appearance. Face yoga strengthens the 55 muscles of your face and is a great alternative to common anti-aging remedies. The yoga techniques are designed to stimulate collagen and elastin production in the middle layer of the skin, giving you smoother, tighter-looking skin and a more radiant complexion. If you practice face yoga regularly, it can smooth your wrinkles, lift eyes, reduce puffiness, tone cheeks, firm jawlines and create a healthy glow. Doing our face yoga exercises once or twice a day, you will see results faster than you think.\r\n\r\nWe collected for you the most fabulous anti-aging face yoga exercises. They may seem unusual sometimes, but face yoga is one of the biggest recent anti-aging trends. Check it out and see for yourself, how they make your face look firm and healthy!"

      "label": "ABOUT THE APP:\nKeeping track of what you eat has been shown to help prevent and stop over-eating.\n\nThis app helps you control your diet and eat healthier, by making it easy to track what you eat. The design is optimized to make entry as quick as possible, with 1 click entry, and recent food suggestions. The built in database already has thousands of food items and if yours are not known, adding them is easy.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: \nThis app is free to download, and supported by advertisements. You can use it for free as long as you like. It is possible to remove the advertisement for a fee, which will also enable additional features.\n\nFEATURES:\n1. A simple and powerful design: The app opens directly on the entry screen, on the most recent meal, because that is what you'll use most. The design makes adding entries as simple and intuitive as possible.\n2. One tap entry with personalized suggestions: The most common food items can immediately be selected. Starting on the second day, your recent items are suggested because you may eat the same food frequently.\n3. Logging in is not needed: No personal data or contact information is required.\n4. Thousands of items already in the database: Most food items have accurate information about common serving sizes, calories, carbohydrates, protein and fat. \n5. Full off-line support: No need to be connected to the internet. \n6. Precise entry is also easy: You can accurately enter the precise amount using a slider.\n7. Daily reports: Using the menu, you can directly open the diary, which shows a summary of your day. Here you can switch between calories, protein and carbohydrates by pressing on little triangle.\n8. Track your goals: After entering your personal goals, you can use the week report to see your trends. \n9. Personal reminders help you stay on target: They are a convenient way to make sure you fill out your diary, after each meal, or at the end of the day.\n\nIt is a good idea to verify the information in the database is the same as the information on your food packaging; food nutrition fluctuates with brands and over time.\n\nMake sure to discuss your goals with your doctor or nutrition specialist.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES:\n1. No more advertisement.\n2. A much larger food database.\n3. The ability to e-mail yourself a copy of the diary.\n4. More configuration options, including the ability to enter up to 8 separate meals a day.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING & TERMS\nThe app is free to download and use. Should you choose to upgrade, we offer a one time payment option, and an auto-renewing subscription option: Renews every three months\nPayment will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.

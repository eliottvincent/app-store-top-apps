Программа постоянно будет анализировать Ваши предыдущие месячные и на их основе строить прогнозы начала следующих циклов. В программу заложены алгоритмы для прогноза дня овуляции и фертильных дней. \n\n- Одной из отличительных особенностей этой программы от аналогичных является встроенный дневник, в который Вы сможете заносить не только свои недомогания, заметки, температуру, вес, но и свои фотографии.\n\n- Специальный планировщик приема лекарств, который интегрирован в дневник, поможет Вам легко сформировать график их приема на каждый день. \n\n\n- В дневнике к любому дню можно прикреплять результаты анализов в виде фотографий и файлов PDF. Если у Вас несколько фотографий одного анализа - не страшно. В программу встроен инструмент объединения фотографий в единый PDF документ. Используя поисковый фильтр Вы легко сможете получить список только тех или иных анализов и быстро их просмотреть. Любой из прикрепленных документов можно отправить по почте или через MMS. Т.о. на период беременности программа может выполнять еще и функцию базы данных Ваших анализов.\n\n- Если отметить в программе начало одной из семи вариантов диет,  то программа начнет  отображать ежедневное меню этой диеты в разделе Расписание на день\n\n- Встроенный в программу механизм напоминаний не даст Вам пропустить прием лекарств или любой другой, Важный для Вас момент. \n\n- Внесенный в дневник вес всегда можно посмотреть на отдельном графике, внесенная температура позволит построить график температуры, например, для выявления дня овуляции \n\n- Раздел \"Расписание на день\" покажет внутри дня напоминания, расписание приема лекарств и меню завтрака, обеда и ужина (а также полдника, второго завтрака) в зависимости от выбранной Вами диеты.\n\n- В программу встроена постоянно пополняемая подборка познавательных роликов с YouTube и подборка текстовой информации по женским циклам, недомоганиям, беременности и т.д.\n\n- Любой из разделов можно обсудить с десятками тысячами других пользователей перейдя на внутренний форум. Не нужно заводить новую учетную запись. Вы можете воспользоваться одним из своих аккаунтов в Facebook, Вконтакте, Одноклассниках, Google+ или Mail.Ru.\n\n- Программа позволяет формировать красочный отчет в формате PDF с фотографиями на основе данных заведенных в дневник.\n\n- Есть возможность установить пароль на вход в программу для защиты личной информации\n\n- Программа поддерживает синхронизацию данных через ICloud, которая сохранит Ваши данные в облаке и позволит легко переносить их на другие устройства\n\n- Изменив задний фон программы Вы сможете полностью видоизменить ее внешний вид подстроив под свое настроение."

И все эти мысли так и стремятся нарушить баланс в повседневной жизни, что может привести к стрессу, бессоннице или неврозам. SPOKI поможет сфокусироваться на переживании настоящего момента, не отвлекаясь на мысли о будущем или прошлом – это и есть осознанность, которой так не хватает в современной жизни. Наша миссия упорядочить хаос современного мира индивидуально для каждого человека, чтобы ни боль прошлого, ни неизвестность будущего не могла вас потрясти и увести в неверном направлении.\n\nМедитация – это простая практика, доступная для всех, которая уменьшит стресс, повысит спокойствие и ясность ума. Причины начать медитировать: помогает при бессоннице, снижает стресс, тревожность и повышает концентрацию внимания. Научиться медитировать несложно, а пользу вы увидите сразу. Для медитации не нужно множество атрибутов: подушки для медитации, четок для чтения мантр, благовония. Нужны только вы, ваше желание и приложение SPOKI.\n\nПрактики разбиты по категориям и позволят вам обрести:\n– Вдохновение\n– Расслабление\n– Сон\n– Спокойствие\n– Фокус\n\nПрактические рекомендации:\n1. Медитируйте утром и вечером\n2. Занятия следует проводить в спокойном уединенном месте.\n3. Закончив свои занятия, не спешите приступать к другим делам, а тем более к суетным.\n\nАффирмации – это позитивные утверждения, при многократном повторении которых, вы сможете улучшить психоэмоциональный фон и стимулировать положительные перемены в жизни. Научные исследования доказывают, что аффирмации помогают повысить самооценку, снизить уровень стресса и улучшить взаимоотношения с окружающими людьми.\n\nБолее 1000 аффирмаций, которые охватывают все аспекты нашей жизни:\n– Любовь к себе\n– Отношения\n– Дружба\n– Стресс\n– Мотивация\n– Карьера\n– Разбитое сердце\n\nПрактические рекомендации:\n1. При чтении аффирмации визуализируйте ваше достижение, к которому вы стремитесь.\n2. Многократно повторяйте пройденные аффирмации, регулярность позволит вам закрепить эффект.\n3. Читать аффирмации следует в комфортном месте наедине. \n\nКаждый день вас ждут аффирмации и медитации на то или иное время суток, подборки редакторов и статистика осознанности, в которой вы можете увидеть минуты осознанности и количество пройденных сессий. Также SPOKI учитывает минуты осознанности в приложении «Здоровье», прогресс автоматически сохраняется в Apple Health.\n\nПолитика конфиденциальности:\nhttps://spoki.space/privacy\n\nУсловия использования:\nhttps://spoki.space/terms\n\nОбратная связь:\nlove@spoki.space"

Savonnette is there to help you understand your consumption of cosmetic products and offer you better and cleaner products for your body health and our planet's health thanks to a scan, statistics and a virtual beauty box.\n\n\nDo you want to know more about Savonnette? Here are some of the features of the application:\n\n- Your closet: If you want to understand the products composition that compose your bathroom cupboards, you just have to scan them and then save them in your closet. You can do as many as you want! This will then allow you to have statistics in order to know your consumption of harmful ingredients, follow your progress more easily and tend towards a cleaner, greener consumption, for your body heath and for our planet\n\n- A virtual beauty box: You will regularly discover, in this box, cosmetics from responsible brands that offer cleaner products that are better for your body health and for our planet. All the compositions are decrypted even in this box\n\n- A scanner to allow you to scan your cosmetic products in order to know everything about them, to know their origin: The composition, the dangerousness of the ingredients for your body health and for our planet, their origin, their function, their frequency of use. I'm also trying to teach you a little more about the composition to know how to decrypt them more easily, to act cleaner. And if you don't have the product to scan it, you can always search manually and have access to its composition.\n\n- A history: You will find there all the scans that you have done or the products that you have consulted. If you have a crush on a cleaner product just add it to favorites.\n\n- Access to all features anonymously: No account needed! And thanks to a QRcode you will always have access to your favorite products, your history, your box, your closets.\n\nAt Savonnette we want to support you towards more responsible consumption: consumption that allows you to pay attention to the health of your body but also to the health of the planet. Let me explain: In a world where we swim in information flows, where time is precious and where our body health and our planet health are most important, we want, thanks to all this information, to propose the most suitable and appropriate cosmetic products.\n\nSo do you want to participate in your well-being ?

Upgrade to a Strong PRO subscription ($4.99/month or $29.99/year) for an unlimited number of routines and to unlock additional PRO features.\n\nStrong will automatically charge your iTunes Account at the end of your subscription or free trial period unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of your current period. Subscriptions renew at the original price. You can turn off auto-renew at any time and still receive full functionality until the end of your current period, but no refund can be provided for unused portions of the subscription. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nIf you’ve previously purchased “Unlock Strong” or “Strong Combo Pack”, you’ll be able to use the Restore Purchases option in the app for access to all Strong PRO features.\n\nThese prices are for customers in the United States and may vary depending on your iTunes Account settings.

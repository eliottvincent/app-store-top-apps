А ещё выбирать акцентные цвета в оформлении, если станет скучно.\n• Настраивать эквалайзер, устанавливать таймер для сна и включать разные режимы воспроизведения (но выбирайте плейлисты для медитации, если планируете спать под музыку).\n• Запускать бесконечные плейлисты — если ваш плейлист закончился, наш всё равно не сдаётся.\n• Слушать музыку офлайн с подпиской.\n\n\nНас не остановить\nМузыкальные миксы формируются на основе ваших предпочтений. Просто выберите трек, артиста, альбом, плейлист — и они превратятся в основу для микса, который будет играть нон-стоп. Мы поможем избежать неловкой тишины после последней песни в альбоме: наши миксы не заканчиваются.\n\nVK mix — это микс, который подстраивается под ваше настроение. Мы делаем всё, чтобы музыка поддерживала вас в любой момент: и в грусти, и в радости.\n\n\nМожно слушать офлайн\nВ самолёте, в тундре, на дне Марианской впадины — там, где сложности с интернетом. Можно просто скачать трек в приложении и наслаждаться среди подводных жителей. Только потребуется подписка. \n\nНовая музыка\nПоявляется в нашей библиотеке ежедневно. Она везде: в редакционных плейлистах, в чартах с новинками. Так что быть в тренде мы тоже с лёгкостью поможем.\n\n\nОбратите внимание\n• Приложение использует автопродление подписки на музыку.\nПри подтверждении покупки оплата произойдёт с вашей учётной записи iTunes.\n• Оформите подписку, чтобы получить доступ ко всем возможностям приложения.\n• Подписка является услугой с ежемесячной стоимостью — 169 р./мес. для России и 3,99 $/мес. для других стран: Азербайджана, Армении, Белоруссии, Грузии, Казахстана, Киргизии, Молдавии, Таджикистана, Туркменистана, Узбекистана, Украины.\n\nВладельцам подписки:\n• Подписка продлевается автоматически, если автопродление не отключено ранее чем за 24 часа до завершения текущего периода.\n• Удаление приложения не прекращает действие подписки.\n• При отмене подписки её действие сохраняется до конца оплаченного периода. Возврат платежа за текущую подписку невозможен, отмена подписки произойдёт после окончания текущего подписного периода.\nВы можете управлять подпиской или отключить автопродление в настройках своей учётной записи Apple ID.\n• Неиспользованная часть бесплатного пробного периода аннулируется после приобретения подписки.\n\nПолитика конфиденциальности: boom.ru/privacy.\nУсловия использования: boom.ru/terms."

It takes only a single tap in the beatmap zone to activate the \"1-Tap Auto-Sync\" feature, which will align the tracks perfectly. \n\nTouch DJ Evolution simply makes the mixing too easy, removing the need of technical beatmatching skills. The tracks are simply always in sync, and moreover, the key of the tracks doesn't change when the speed of the track is modified, thanks to the \"Master Tempo\" (\"Key Lock\") technology. \n\nInstead of being busy with syncing the tracks, user can now focus on the more creative aspects of the mixing, and Touch DJ Evolution offers great possibilities of being creative. Quantized loops, 7 effects, sampler, automatic EQ, unlimited cue points - such impressive feature list is found only on expensive hardware setups, and some features, like Party Mode (Auto-DJ) are absolutely unique. \n\nTouch DJ™ Evolution features...\n\n1-TAP AUTO-SYNC • BEATMAPS & BEAT PHASE • MASTER TEMPO / KEY LOCK • RECORD MIX • UNLIMITED CUE POINTS • QUANTIZED LOOPS • 7 FX • IPOD IMPORT • ON-THE-FLY PEAK BUILDING AND BPM DETECTION • AUTO EQ • AUTO CROSSFADER • 5 CRATES • 6-SLOT SAMPLER • PARTY MODE (AUTO DJ) \n\n- FREE TO TRY // Comes with 5 bundled tracks. \n- UNIVERSAL APP // Works on iPhone, iPod Touch & iPad. \n\nYou are welcome to upgrade to PREMIUM MODE (in-app purchase), to gain lifetime access to all of the features, including those that will appear in the updates.

You can also create your own custom sound settings or simply change the pitch to make Metronome Beats easier to hear over your instrument.\n\nRHYTHM AND TEMPO TRAINING\nMetronome Beats has a tempo trainer to help you master your rhythm. Set the metronome to speed up over time or mute every few bars to test your playing.\n\nOnly need a few bars lead in? Use the timer function to stop Metronome Beats when you want. You can also use Metronome Beats at the same time as other apps, allowing you to read sheet music off your Tablet whilst playing the metronome to check your tempo.\n\nADVANCED RHYTHMS AND INTEGRATED DRUM MACHINE\nThe advanced rhythms section allows you to program in more complex rhythms including polyrhythms and swing. There is also an integrated drum machine. Use this to generate a backing track to practice against, or simply have fun generating different rhythms.\n\nSAVE YOUR SETTINGS AND CREATE SETLISTS AND SONGS\nIn the pro version of Metronome Beats you can save your Settings as Presets to access later. You can use these to create song of varying tempos or generate setlists of songs and play through these one by one – useful for solo and group practice as well as playing live on stage.\n\nCONTACT US\nIf you need any help or have any questions about Metronome Beats you can always contact us at support@stonekick.com."

The easiest way to get started with real music production.\n\n*** Apple Design Award ***\n*** Best of App Store ***\n*** Editor’s Choice ***\n\nWHY PEOPLE LOVE AUXY\n“Auxy is my favorite way to get what is going on in my brain into a musical format. It is simple on the surface but with tremendous depth if you need it.” - RAC\n\n“The automation is terrific. I am doing things with Auxy I would not easily do in my studio. The design is insanely smart and forward-thinking.” - Madeon\n\n“It is wild bro, you gotta get this!” - Majid Jordan\n\nCREATE AND MIX LOOPS\nBuild melodies and drum loops by drawing notes. Arrange your loops with scenes to explore ideas or make full-length tracks.\n\nDISCOVER GREAT SOUNDS\nBrowse thousands of high quality synth patches, sampled instruments and one-shot samples. You can import samples to the drum machine and build your own melodic instruments.\n\nADD EFFECTS AND AUTOMATION\nAdd studio-grade effects like reverb, delay, distortion and chorus. Fine-tune sounds to find the perfect mix. Create modulation and transitions with powerful automation.\n\nSHARE AND COLLABORATE\nUpload your tracks to SoundCloud or export them as audio or video files. Quickly share links to your projects if you want to collaborate with other producers.\n\nEXPORT TO YOUR FAVORITE DAW\nYou can export projects to Ableton Live, Bitwig Studio or Studio One, which makes Auxy a great sketchpad for producers on the go. You can also bounce projects as separate audio and MIDI files, which can be imported into any popular music-making app.\n\nJAM WITH FRIENDS\nAuxy supports Ableton Link, which lets you jam in sync with other apps and devices connected to the same Wi-Fi.\n\nTRY IT FREE\nAuxy is free to download and evaluate with a limited set of sounds. You also get a 7-day free trial to evaluate all the sounds and features before you start a subscription.\n\nMADE IN SWEDEN\nAuxy is built by a small and independent team in Sweden. Our mission is to put a studio in everyone's pocket and push music forward as an artform.\n\nTHANK YOU AUSTIN HAGA\nThe music in the preview video is made by Austin Haga.

Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.

      "label": "MEGA provides user-controlled encrypted cloud storage that’s accessed with web browsers and dedicated apps for mobile devices. Unlike other cloud storage providers, your data is encrypted and decrypted by your client devices only and never by us.\n\nUpload files from your smartphone or tablet, then search, store, download, stream, view, share, rename or delete them any time, from any device, anywhere. Share folders with your contacts and see their updates in real time.\n\nMEGA’s strong and secure end-to-end encryption means we cannot access or reset your password. You MUST remember your password and make sure to back up your account Recovery Key. Losing your password and the account Recovery Key will result in lost access to your files.\n\nUse the included MEGA Secure Chat for end-to-end-encrypted communications, including video and audio calls, with total privacy. Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency. The code of our iOS mobile app is located at: https://github.com/meganz/ios\n\nSubscriptions renew automatically for successive periods of the same duration at the same price as the initial period chosen. You can cancel the automatic renewal of your MEGA Pro subscription no later than 24 hours before your next subscription payment is due, via your iTunes account settings page. To manage your subscriptions, tap on the App Store icon on your device, sign in with your Apple ID at the bottom of the page (if you haven’t already done so) and then tap View ID. You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions. From there, you can select your MEGA Pro subscription and view your scheduled renewal date, choose a different subscription package or toggle the on-off switch to off to disable the auto-renewal of your subscription.\n\nTerms of Service: https://mega.io/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://mega.io/privacy"

Back up and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

      "label": "Yandex Mail is a reliable email solution for work and personal correspondences with a built-in translator. Your emails will be safe thanks to built-in virus protection and spam blocking. Work with emails and attachments at any time on any device, and connect all your email accounts.\n\n• No frills. Unsubscribe from all unnecessary mailing lists at once by selecting them in the general address list. You don't have to open unwanted emails anymore to unsubscribe from the mailing list.\n• The app supports working with multiple email accounts at the same time, including Mail, Google, Outlook, Yahoo, Rambler, and iCloud. Read emails from different mailboxes in the same app.\n• All email attachments, including photos and documents, are automatically saved to the Yandex Disk cloud and are accessible from any device.\n• You can work with Yandex Mail without an internet connection. For example, if you lose your connection in the metro, you can still read emails and reply to them, and your messages will be sent automatically when you're back online.\n• Work with email on the go: see attachments, listen to an email if you're busy, and respond with a template message in one touch. Yandex Mail has a built-in translator for incoming and outgoing messages. You can read an email in a foreign language without any difficulties.\n• Protect yourself from hacking and spam. To prevent others from reading your emails, enable PIN code login. Yandex Mail smart algorithms reliably protect you from unwanted mailing lists.\n• Video meetings by link and Calendar. With Telemost, you can arrange work conferences and family chats. Make video calls on any device with no time restrictions. Organize calls directly in the Yandex Disk app without having to switch to Zoom, Skype, WhatsApp, or any other services. And if you add a meeting to Yandex Calendar, all participants will receive a reminder email.\n• An exclusive address. Connect Yandex 360 Premium to choose a unique address with your name or what you do. An exclusive address lets people know the line of work you're in. For example: alex@business-design.ru. Your email will stand out and get extra attention.\n• Backups. Restore emails, no matter what happens. For example, if you accidentally lose an important correspondence, it can be restored up to 6 months later, not just 1 month. Email and folder backups are available with Yandex 360 Premium plans. Backups save an unchanged copy of your correspondences.\n\nYandex Mail is a Russian email service — an alternative to Mail, Gmail, iCloud, and Rambler. Yandex Mail users get 5 GB of free cloud storage on Yandex Disk.\nYandex Mail data is securely stored in multiple copies in different data centers in Russia, so you'll always have access to your files."

The ODB 2 car scanner will be able to notify about problems related to the car's engine and transmission, like the gearbox, clutch, or other car parts related to the vehicle's torque.\n\nOur car scanner requires an ELM 327 OBD2 Bluetooth or WiFi adapter, like Veepeak or Vgate scan adapters. Also compatible with a klavkarr diagnostic car code reader.\n\n◉ WHAT OBD 2 CAR DIAGNOSTICS SCANNER BRINGS TO THE TABLE?\n\n√ View OBD 2 engine and transmission fault codes (also known as DTCs for Data Trouble Code) and see their meaning. E OBD11 Facile car scanner contains more than 15,000 definitions.\n\n√ Delete (or erase) OBD2 fault codes with an ELM 327 port.\n\n√ Clear the Malfunction Indicator Light (check engine light) on your car dashboard with our OBD 2 software.\n\n√ EOBD Facile displays manufacturer-specific OBDii error codes.

This list is available for free on our website, which includes OBD2 BMW, OBD2 Audi, OBD 2 Nissan, ODB 2 Jeep, ODB Subaru and many others.\n\nIn general, all petrol vehicles produced since 2001 and diesel vehicles produced since 2004 are compatible with the E OBD Facile car scanner and ELM 327, whatever the brand.\n\nCan't find the location of your OBD 2 torque adapter? Download our App \"Where is my OBD2 port?\" Find it!\n\nThe connection with your smartphone can be done using either an ELM 327 OBD2 Bluetooth or WiFi. Our E OBD11 Facile car scanner functions with these 2 types of wireless connection.\n\nWarning: Lots of car scanners claiming to be ELM 327 compatible are sold on the internet under different names. But most of those scanners do not work properly. The connection problems with your car may come from these Chinese copies of ELM327 torque.\n\nFrom our app, you can test whether your ELM 327 has all the mandatory functionalities to provide you a quality OBDii diagnosis.\n\nIf the majority of the functions are not available during this test, it is because your ODB car scanner is defective. In this case, we invite you to contact the company which sells these ELM327: Kiwi 3, Viecar, Veepeak, Carista, LELink or Vgate scan adapter functions with our ODB2 car scanner app Torque.\n\nFor more information on our app and ODB2 car diagnostics scanner, please visit our website: outilsobdfacile.com\n\nDownload EOBD Facile and have access to the best ODB Car scanner, compatible with ELM 327 Bluetooth adapters.

Used by millions worldwide, our all-new email app protects your communications and has everything you need to easily manage your inbox.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says:\n“Proton Mail offers encrypted email, which makes it virtually impossible for anyone to read it except the sender and the recipient.”\n\nWith the all-new Proton Mail app, you can:\n• Create a @proton.me or @protonmail.com email address \n• Send and receive encrypted emails and attachments with ease\n• Switch between multiple Proton Mail accounts\n• Easily manage your email with conversations\n• Keep your inbox tidy and clean with folders, labels and simple swipe-gestures\n• Receive new email notifications\n• Send Password-protected Emails to anyone\n• Enjoy your inbox in dark mode\n\nWhy use Proton Mail?\n• Proton Mail is free — We believe everyone deserves privacy. Upgrade to a paid plan to get more done and support our mission. \n• Easy to use — Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to read, organize, and write your emails.\n• Your inbox is yours — We don’t spy on your communications to show you targeted ads.

Data is encrypted on the client side using an encryption key that Proton does not have access to. This means we don't have the technical ability to decrypt your messages.\n\nOpen-Source Cryptography\nProton Mail's open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security experts from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection. Proton Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP, while all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By using open-source libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption algorithms used do not have clandestinely built-in back doors.\n\nProton Mail in the press:\n“Proton Mail is a Gmail-like email system which uses end-to-end encryption, making it impossible for outside parties to monitor.” Forbes\n\n“A new email service being developed by a group who met at MIT and CERN promises to bring secure, encrypted email to the masses and keep sensitive information away from prying eyes.” Huffington Post\n\nFollow Proton on social media for all the latest news and offers:\nFacebook: /proton\nTwitter: @protonprivacy\nReddit: /protonmail\nInstagram: /protonprivacy\n\nFor more information, visit: https://proton.me/mail\nOur open-source code base: https://github.com/ProtonMail"

Was it voluntarily or maybe someone just deactivated their account? Headaches and worries in the past, Yupi does everything for you!\n\nJust imagine how much time you save by not creating a list of followers, trying to figure out who started following and who unfollowed. All these tables and lists would drive anyone crazy, and still will not give a clear understanding of, for example, when exactly a person stopped following your profile.\n\nAs soon as you install Yupi, app immediately starts watching all changes in your activity, with an accuracy of a second. The application notifies you not only about followers and unfollowers, but also shows detailed statistics of your stories, who watched your Instagram stories, how many times, which story is the most popular, and which, on the contrary, is not popular at all. Have you been unfollowed? Unfollow them back! Or maybe you have devoted fans? It's just so easy to find out, Yupi makes a separate list of those who follow you without following them back.\nAnd that's not all. Yupi enlarges your profile pictures in no time. Zoom the profile picture with one click, now you don't have to peer into a small image.\n\nYou can contact for support info@yupireport.com\n\nInformation about the auto-renewable nature of the subscriptions\nEvery time you can reach your updated reports and if you want to continue getting reports, your subscription should be continued.\nSubscription periods are 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. Every month, 6 months or year your subscription renews.\n1 month subscription price is $4.99. 6 Months Subscription price is $18.99. 1 year price is $24,99.\nSubscriptions will automatically renew unless cancelled at least one day before the renewal date within 24 hours before the end of the current period.\nPayment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.\nIf you subscribe before a free trial ends, the remainder of the trial period will be forfeited.\nYou can manage and cancel your subscription by going to your account settings in the App Store\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://yupireport.com/privacy-policy\nTerms and Conditions: https://yupireport.com/terms\nEULA: https://yupireport.com/eula\n\nThis app only provides analytics for your instagram account.

Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance.  \n\nThis set of widgets can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define.  For example, a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your work day, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day.  This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\nActivity widgets require a paired Apple Watch\n\nThe app itself also includes a wide collection of tools, such as a weather app, a timezone converter, a calendar.  These tools can automatically launch based on the active widget tapped.\n\nNotes:\n • Widgetsmith optionally integrates with Apple Health.  This data is used to display your step and activity if you select one of those widget types.  Permission for Widgetsmith to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.  \n• Widgetsmith includes an optional premium subscription.  This is offered on a monthly or annual basis.  If you choose to purchase a subscription your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\n• Access to Tide and Weather hosted data is only available to Widgetsmith Premium subscribers.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith_privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith-terms-of-use.html"

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

Zero-log policy, traffic encryption, IP and DNS masking. These all mean that third parties are not able to monitor you any longer, and that your privacy is reliably secured from obtrusive website and ISP surveillance.\n\n+70 LOCATIONS\nOur high-speed VPN servers in 70+ locations all over the globe, as well as our enhanced KeepSolid Wise technology, allow you to freely surf the web without giving out a single piece of your personal information, including your current location. Don’t let websites discriminate you based on the way you surf the internet or the place you browse it from.\n\nTOTAL SECURITY\nWe offers a variety of VPN protocols, each with unique capabilities and strengths. Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. All costs for subscriptions are mentioned above.\n\nPrivacy policies : https://luni.app/support/vpn_privacy\nTerms of use : https://luni.app/support/vpn_terms\n\nDisclaimer: We have had reports that our VPN service might be blocked in the countries listed below:\n- China\n- UAE\n- Saudi Arabia\n- Iraq\n- Iran\n- Turkmenistan\n- Turkey\n\nWhile we can’t say that it’s totally impossible to connect in the mentioned locations, there are a few challenges to overcome."

      "label": "Yandex Mail is a reliable email solution for work and personal correspondences with a built-in translator. Your emails will be safe thanks to built-in virus protection and spam blocking. Work with emails and attachments at any time on any device, and connect all your email accounts.\n\n• No frills. Unsubscribe from all unnecessary mailing lists at once by selecting them in the general address list. You don't have to open unwanted emails anymore to unsubscribe from the mailing list.\n• The app supports working with multiple email accounts at the same time, including Mail, Google, Outlook, Yahoo, Rambler, and iCloud. Read emails from different mailboxes in the same app.\n• All email attachments, including photos and documents, are automatically saved to the Yandex Disk cloud and are accessible from any device.\n• You can work with Yandex Mail without an internet connection. For example, if you lose your connection in the metro, you can still read emails and reply to them, and your messages will be sent automatically when you're back online.\n• Work with email on the go: see attachments, listen to an email if you're busy, and respond with a template message in one touch. Yandex Mail has a built-in translator for incoming and outgoing messages. You can read an email in a foreign language without any difficulties.\n• Protect yourself from hacking and spam. To prevent others from reading your emails, enable PIN code login. Yandex Mail smart algorithms reliably protect you from unwanted mailing lists.\n• Video meetings by link and Calendar. With Telemost, you can arrange work conferences and family chats. Make video calls on any device with no time restrictions. Organize calls directly in the Yandex Disk app without having to switch to Zoom, Skype, WhatsApp, or any other services. And if you add a meeting to Yandex Calendar, all participants will receive a reminder email.\n• An exclusive address. Connect Yandex 360 Premium to choose a unique address with your name or what you do. An exclusive address lets people know the line of work you're in. For example: alex@business-design.ru. Your email will stand out and get extra attention.\n• Backups. Restore emails, no matter what happens. For example, if you accidentally lose an important correspondence, it can be restored up to 6 months later, not just 1 month. Email and folder backups are available with Yandex 360 Premium plans. Backups save an unchanged copy of your correspondences.\n\nYandex Mail is a Russian email service — an alternative to Mail, Gmail, iCloud, and Rambler. Yandex Mail users get 5 GB of free cloud storage on Yandex Disk.\nYandex Mail data is securely stored in multiple copies in different data centers in Russia, so you'll always have access to your files."

Run an OBD 2 car diagnostic with your smartphone and discover the reason why the OBD light is on... No need to go to the mechanic for car maintenance!\n\nConnect an ELM 327 diagnostic interface to your car's ODB port (OBD 2) and run our OBD2 car diagnostics scanner app: you will be able to read the engine and transmission fault codes and view data from your vehicle in real time. The ODB 2 car scanner will be able to notify about problems related to the car's engine and transmission, like the gearbox, clutch, or other car parts related to the vehicle's torque.\n\nOur car scanner requires an ELM 327 OBD2 Bluetooth or WiFi adapter, like Veepeak or Vgate scan adapters. Also compatible with a klavkarr diagnostic car code reader.\n\n◉ WHAT OBD 2 CAR DIAGNOSTICS SCANNER BRINGS TO THE TABLE?\n\n√ View OBD 2 engine and transmission fault codes (also known as DTCs for Data Trouble Code) and see their meaning. E OBD11 Facile car scanner contains more than 15,000 definitions.\n\n√ Delete (or erase) OBD2 fault codes with an ELM 327 port.\n\n√ Clear the Malfunction Indicator Light (check engine light) on your car dashboard with our OBD 2 software.\n\n√ EOBD Facile displays manufacturer-specific OBDii error codes. They will bring you additional information for the following brands: BMW, Lexus, Ford, Jeep, Kia, Nissan, Audi, Subaru, Volvo, etc…\n\n√ Real-time display of car sensors and possibility of recording in a file. Depending on your vehicle's configuration you will be able to see: vehicle speed, engine rpm, engine temperature, ignition timing, engine torque, the amount of air intake, etc.\n\n√ Create records of your trips with E OBD Facile car diagnostic Windows / Macbook software.\n\n√ E OBD Facile OBD2 car diagnostic also lets you measure the acceleration performance of your car (0-100 km/h, standing start, etc.)\n\n◉ COMPATIBLE VEHICLES WITH OBD 2\n\nTo check whether your car is compatible with the E OBD2 / ODB2 standard, visit our website. We created, with the data provided by our community, a list of several thousand OBD11 compatible vehicles tested with our E OBD Facile car scanner software. This list is available for free on our website, which includes OBD2 BMW, OBD2 Audi, OBD 2 Nissan, ODB 2 Jeep, ODB Subaru and many others.\n\nIn general, all petrol vehicles produced since 2001 and diesel vehicles produced since 2004 are compatible with the E OBD Facile car scanner and ELM 327, whatever the brand.\n\nCan't find the location of your OBD 2 torque adapter? Download our App \"Where is my OBD2 port?\" Find it!\n\nThe connection with your smartphone can be done using either an ELM 327 OBD2 Bluetooth or WiFi. Our E OBD11 Facile car scanner functions with these 2 types of wireless connection.\n\nWarning: Lots of car scanners claiming to be ELM 327 compatible are sold on the internet under different names. But most of those scanners do not work properly. The connection problems with your car may come from these Chinese copies of ELM327 torque.\n\nFrom our app, you can test whether your ELM 327 has all the mandatory functionalities to provide you a quality OBDii diagnosis.\n\nIf the majority of the functions are not available during this test, it is because your ODB car scanner is defective. In this case, we invite you to contact the company which sells these ELM327: Kiwi 3, Viecar, Veepeak, Carista, LELink or Vgate scan adapter functions with our ODB2 car scanner app Torque.\n\nFor more information on our app and ODB2 car diagnostics scanner, please visit our website: outilsobdfacile.com\n\nDownload EOBD Facile and have access to the best ODB Car scanner, compatible with ELM 327 Bluetooth adapters.

We've tried all the apps that let you do it over WiFi, but they're not fast enough, so we also allow you to use a wired USB connection.\n\nQUALITY VIDEO\nYour iPhone/iPad camera's are good, really good. In fact, there’s no comparison between the highly recommended streaming webcam, the Logitech C922 HD Pro and the iPhone 6 Camera. Stream Landscape or Portrait video.\n\nAUDIO\nIf you don't have a separate mic for your streaming setup, you can now use the microphone on your iOS device to stream audio & video.\n\nFRONT CAMERA\nStream a selfie with the front camera support. Switch anytime during the stream with the familiar camera switch button.\n\nTAP TO FOCUS, PINCH TO ZOOM\nControls just like you're used to from the Camera app.\n\nMANUAL CONTROLS\nTake control of the focus, exposure, white balance as you would on a manual DSLR camera.\n\nLOW LATENCY\nStream video over a wired USB connection. This avoids the issue of delay over wifi, as many other solutions suffer from. This is just as fast as a USB webcam!\n\nUSB & WIFI\nChoose the connection type. If you want low latency, use USB, if you'd like portability then use WiFi. WiFi is done using the NewTek™ NDI® protocol, so you can use Camera for OBS Studio with any NewTek™ NDI® compatible receiver.\n\nREMOTE CONTROL\nControl the app from your web browser on your computer. No need to have access to the device anymore to line up that shot perfectly.\n\nMULTIPLE DEVICES\nIf you're lucky enough to own multiple iOS devices, use them together and produce a multi-camera stream.\n\nMAC AND PC\nSupports OBS Studio running on macOS and Windows.\n\nYou will need to install the OBS Studio iOS Camera Plugin from our website, or use an NDI compatible receiver to use this app.\n\nFor the best possible experience make sure your device is listed on our website https://obs.camera/docs/faqs/#what-ios-hardware-do-i-need\n\n\nMORE\n\nSubscriptions will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless automatic renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "Record your working time after work is done, always and everywhere. So handwritten time sheets are a thing of the past.\nmyTime is the ideal companion where a complicated and expensive time recording system is superfluous. You can record your times, calculate overtime, record your vacation days, reduce overtime, enter notes and much more.\n\nThe app can also be used for multiple jobs simultaneously, as you can save the time for each job independently.\nYou always have an overview of all your jobs.\nIf required, each job can be set up individually e.g. daily working time, start and end of work, break times and much more can be preset. This turns the daily recording of your work into a child's play.\n \nWith the export function you can easily save your working times as PDF-file on your device or in the cloud.\nForwarding via email, WhatsApp, messages, etc., is no problem either. By exporting it as a CSV file, you can then continue working in Excel, Numbers, LibreOffice Calc... for example.\n\nThe backup function of the app saves all your data that you have entered in the app in a file. This can be stored in your iCloud or on your device or even sent. \nThe backup file can then be read again on another device, for example, and all your data transferred. Of course, this also works on the same device to restore saved data.\n \nFUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE:\n* Enter working times\n* Automatic overtime calculation\n* keep track of vacation, illness, holidays, etc\n* overtime reduction\n* Note for each day\n* PDF and CSV Export (In-App Purchase)\n* Easy data forwarding\n* Support for multiple jobs\n* Backup function (In-App Purchase)\n* Simple overview\n* Dark Mode\n\nData protection is a top priority at myTime. The data belongs to you. The app will not send any data to anyone, neither the developer nor any other third party or service. You have full control over your data and to whom it is sent. They are only stored on your device and you can delete them at any time.\n \nQUESTIONS?\nDo you have any questions or feedback? Write a message to help.myTime@gmx.de"

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

Zero-log policy, traffic encryption, IP and DNS masking. These all mean that third parties are not able to monitor you any longer, and that your privacy is reliably secured from obtrusive website and ISP surveillance.\n\n+70 LOCATIONS\nOur high-speed VPN servers in 70+ locations all over the globe, as well as our enhanced KeepSolid Wise technology, allow you to freely surf the web without giving out a single piece of your personal information, including your current location. Don’t let websites discriminate you based on the way you surf the internet or the place you browse it from.\n\nTOTAL SECURITY\nWe offers a variety of VPN protocols, each with unique capabilities and strengths. Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. All costs for subscriptions are mentioned above.\n\nPrivacy policies : https://luni.app/support/vpn_privacy\nTerms of use : https://luni.app/support/vpn_terms\n\nDisclaimer: We have had reports that our VPN service might be blocked in the countries listed below:\n- China\n- UAE\n- Saudi Arabia\n- Iraq\n- Iran\n- Turkmenistan\n- Turkey\n\nWhile we can’t say that it’s totally impossible to connect in the mentioned locations, there are a few challenges to overcome."

Your emails will be safe thanks to built-in virus protection and spam blocking. Work with emails and attachments at any time on any device, and connect all your email accounts.\n\n• No frills. Unsubscribe from all unnecessary mailing lists at once by selecting them in the general address list. You don't have to open unwanted emails anymore to unsubscribe from the mailing list.\n• The app supports working with multiple email accounts at the same time, including Mail, Google, Outlook, Yahoo, Rambler, and iCloud. Read emails from different mailboxes in the same app.\n• All email attachments, including photos and documents, are automatically saved to the Yandex Disk cloud and are accessible from any device.\n• You can work with Yandex Mail without an internet connection. For example, if you lose your connection in the metro, you can still read emails and reply to them, and your messages will be sent automatically when you're back online.\n• Work with email on the go: see attachments, listen to an email if you're busy, and respond with a template message in one touch. Yandex Mail has a built-in translator for incoming and outgoing messages. You can read an email in a foreign language without any difficulties.\n• Protect yourself from hacking and spam. To prevent others from reading your emails, enable PIN code login. Yandex Mail smart algorithms reliably protect you from unwanted mailing lists.\n• Video meetings by link and Calendar. With Telemost, you can arrange work conferences and family chats. Make video calls on any device with no time restrictions. Organize calls directly in the Yandex Disk app without having to switch to Zoom, Skype, WhatsApp, or any other services. And if you add a meeting to Yandex Calendar, all participants will receive a reminder email.\n• An exclusive address. Connect Yandex 360 Premium to choose a unique address with your name or what you do. An exclusive address lets people know the line of work you're in. For example: alex@business-design.ru. Your email will stand out and get extra attention.\n• Backups. Restore emails, no matter what happens. For example, if you accidentally lose an important correspondence, it can be restored up to 6 months later, not just 1 month. Email and folder backups are available with Yandex 360 Premium plans. Backups save an unchanged copy of your correspondences.\n\nYandex Mail is a Russian email service — an alternative to Mail, Gmail, iCloud, and Rambler. Yandex Mail users get 5 GB of free cloud storage on Yandex Disk.\nYandex Mail data is securely stored in multiple copies in different data centers in Russia, so you'll always have access to your files."

We automatically organize all the things life throws at you, like receipts and attachments, so you can find what you need fast. Plus, we've got your back with other convenient features like one-tap unsubscribe, free trial expiration alerts and package tracking. \n\nFavorite features:\n\n• One-tap unsubscribe from pushy promos\nSkip the tiny unsubscribe links at the end of long emails. We organize all your mailing lists in one spot, so it’s easy to unsubscribe from noisy newsletters and promos with a quick tap. \n\n• Organize and navigate your inbox with ease\nFind what you need fast with inbox filters that sort your emails by attachments, starred, unread, and more. Stay organized and clear out the junk by deleting or moving up to 10,000 emails at once from a particular sender or category. \n\n• Quickly spot receipts & package delivery updates\nSee all your receipts organized in one place so you can easily find the one you're looking for. Plus, see the status of all your upcoming deliveries at a glance. Top-of-inbox package tracking alerts means you'll never miss a delivery. \n\n• Pull up the best deals from your inbox\nNo more searching through countless promotional emails to find those savings. This view organizes your inbox around your favorite stores and the categories you shop. Now, find all your favorite deals—without the clutter.\n\n• Keep tabs on your free trials\nGet reminders before free trials expire—so you can update your subscription plan or cancel before the subscription trial ends. \n\n• Customize your notifications\nChoose which notifications you really need and say bye-bye to the ones you don't. You can turn on alerts for emails from people, bills & receipts, deals, travel, reminders or general messages. \n\n• Connect your other accounts\nBring your Gmail, AOL, or Microsoft accounts and take advantage of extra features. Set your own swipe actions, change up the sounds or swap in your favorite color. (We like purple)\n\n• Accessibility\nMaking sure our products are accessible is a priority. Yahoo Mail has high contrast themes, dynamic text resizing and VoiceOver screen reader compatibility. Plus, folders at the bottom of the inbox allow assistive technology users to navigate with less effort.\n\n• 1,000GB free storage\nThat's 985 more than some other inboxes, just sayin. ;) Download the app and enjoy a more spacious inbox.\n\n• Yahoo Mail Plus \nGet ad-free mail, extra organization and privacy features, plus 24/7 tech support across your iOS mobile devices.\n\n+        Available as an in-app purchase at $1.99/month charged to your iTunes account\n+        Subscription will auto-renew each month within 24 hours of your renewal date\n+        Manage or cancel your subscription via Account Settings\n\nTerms of service: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/index.html\nPrivacy policy: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.html\n\nHow are we doing?

Weaker encryption isn't even an option\n• Global VPN network: With servers in 22+ countries and lightning-fast speeds, access the websites and apps you love. Anytime, anywhere\n• Helpful support that always responds within 24 hours\n\nWHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\"TunnelBear is an elegant, easy mobile VPN that keeps you safe.\"\n  - Lifehacker\n\n\"The app is bursting with charm, but it also delivers security at a good price.\"\n  - PCMag\n\n\"All you have to do is turn the switch to \"ON\" and you are protected.\"\n  - WSJ\n\n\"TunnelBear, the gorgeous VPN app that wants to bring online privacy to everyone.\"\n  - VentureBeat\n\nPRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE:\n*Spoiler alert* TunnelBear has a strict no-logging policy.

Enjoy greater mobility when you use the Singpass app. You no longer need to wait for an SMS OTP to access digital services.\n\n***\n\nKEY APP FEATURES\n\nDIGITAL SIGNING: Sign documents and contracts easily and securely with your Singpass app, removing the need for physical presence and paper-based signing.\n\nINBOX: Receive government notifications through the Singpass app inbox.\n\nVERIFY: Verify your identity in-person securely, with QR scanning.\n\nDOCUMENTS: Download and store your COVID-19 vaccination information (EU Digital COVID Certificate) in the Apple Health app; Save your vaccination card to Apple Wallet.\n\n***\n\nSET UP IN 3 EASY STEPS\n\nAll you need is a smartphone, internet connection, and a registered Singpass account.\n\n• Step 1: Install the Singpass app.\n\n• Step 2: Complete a one-time set up.\n\n• Step 3: Your trusted digital identity is now ready for use!

Most users reported that iOS managed to retrieve the necessary configuration after some time.\n• Restart the phone once (or twice), and wait for a couple minutes for iOS to initialise the Universal Links for the Singpass app (as well as all your other affected apps).\n• Uninstall the Singpass app from your device, then download the app again from the official App Store."

Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance.  \n\nThis set of widgets can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define.  For example, a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your work day, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day.  This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\nActivity widgets require a paired Apple Watch\n\nThe app itself also includes a wide collection of tools, such as a weather app, a timezone converter, a calendar.  These tools can automatically launch based on the active widget tapped.\n\nNotes:\n • Widgetsmith optionally integrates with Apple Health.  This data is used to display your step and activity if you select one of those widget types.  Permission for Widgetsmith to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.  \n• Widgetsmith includes an optional premium subscription.  This is offered on a monthly or annual basis.  If you choose to purchase a subscription your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\n• Access to Tide and Weather hosted data is only available to Widgetsmith Premium subscribers.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith_privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith-terms-of-use.html"

You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

А в разделе «Каталог» собираем для вас ещё больше выгодных предложений от МТС и партнёров.\n\nИтак, что можно делать в Мой МТС:\n\n— Управлять номерами\nДобавляйте свои номера и настраивайте их. Вы также можете подключать номера ваших близких и управлять ими. Кроме того, дополнительно можно добавить номера умных устройств и услуг для дома — так у вас будет удобный доступ ко всей информации о них. А переключаться между аккаунтами просто — на главном экране привычным свайпом.\n\n— Добавлять виджеты\nСпециальные элементы, которые сделают главный экран удобным для вас. Управляйте услугами и продуктами компании через виджеты мобильной связи, Premium, KION и др. Они покажут состояние счёта, остаток интернета, новинки кино, свежие музыкальные треки и многое другое.\n\n— Ловить выгодные предложения\nИгры, развлечения, скидки — вы найдёте здесь что-то полезное. В виджете «Призы и подарки» на главном экране — промокоды и спецпредложения на полезные и развлекательные сервисы от МТС и партнёров — МТС Music, онлайн-кинотеатр KION, Строки и многие другие. А ещё можно выигрывать призы и получать скидки на цифровые продукты и услуги связи.\n\n— Пополнять счёт\nС помощью СБП, банковских карт, автоплатежа, через push и другими способами. В разделе «Финансы» удобно оформить карту МТС Cashback ― по ней возвращается до 25% кешбэка. Здесь же можно совершать денежные переводы по РФ и СНГ, пополнять баланс транспортных карт и электронных кошельков, оплачивать парковку, ЖКХ, Госуслуги, а также оформить страховку на авто, ипотеку или питомца.\n\n— Проверять состояние счёта\nВиджет мобильной связи на главном экране покажет баланс и остаток по пакету. Подключать услуги, тарифы и подписки можно в этом же разделе. Чтобы увидеть списания и пополнения, нажмите кнопку «Мои расходы» на главном экране или коснитесь виджета «Расходы» на экране «Финансы». Если понадобится, закажите детализацию за нужные даты.\n\n— Выбрать тему приложения\nТёмная тема удобна, если вы часто смотрите на экран в вечернее время. Установите её в разделе «Ещё» ― «Настройки».\n\n— Найти ответ на возникший вопрос\nВсе самые популярные вопросы-ответы вы можете найти в разделе «Поддержка» — «Справка». Там же читайте полезные статьи про Мой МТС и продукты экосистемы. И, если что, пишите нам в чат — обязательно ответим.\n\nТрафик в приложении не расходуется и не оплачивается. Плата списывается согласно тарифу, только если вы устанавливаете и обновляете Мой МТС или переходите по внешним ссылкам.\n\nМы всегда рады вашим отзывам и ждём их на app@mts.ru."

We organize all your mailing lists in one spot, so it’s easy to unsubscribe from noisy newsletters and promos with a quick tap. \n\n• Organize and navigate your inbox with ease\nFind what you need fast with inbox filters that sort your emails by attachments, starred, unread, and more.

Plus, see the status of all your upcoming deliveries at a glance.

This view organizes your inbox around your favorite stores and the categories you shop. Now, find all your favorite deals—without the clutter.\n\n• Keep tabs on your free trials\nGet reminders before free trials expire—so you can update your subscription plan or cancel before the subscription trial ends. \n\n• Customize your notifications\nChoose which notifications you really need and say bye-bye to the ones you don't. You can turn on alerts for emails from people, bills & receipts, deals, travel, reminders or general messages. \n\n• Connect your other accounts\nBring your Gmail, AOL, or Microsoft accounts and take advantage of extra features. Set your own swipe actions, change up the sounds or swap in your favorite color. (We like purple)\n\n• Accessibility\nMaking sure our products are accessible is a priority. Yahoo Mail has high contrast themes, dynamic text resizing and VoiceOver screen reader compatibility. Plus, folders at the bottom of the inbox allow assistive technology users to navigate with less effort.\n\n• 1,000GB free storage\nThat's 985 more than some other inboxes, just sayin. ;) Download the app and enjoy a more spacious inbox.\n\n• Yahoo Mail Plus \nGet ad-free mail, extra organization and privacy features, plus 24/7 tech support across your iOS mobile devices.\n\n+        Available as an in-app purchase at $1.99/month charged to your iTunes account\n+        Subscription will auto-renew each month within 24 hours of your renewal date\n+        Manage or cancel your subscription via Account Settings\n\nTerms of service: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/index.html\nPrivacy policy: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.html\n\nHow are we doing?

Weaker encryption isn't even an option\n• Global VPN network: With servers in 22+ countries and lightning-fast speeds, access the websites and apps you love. Anytime, anywhere\n• Helpful support that always responds within 24 hours\n\nWHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\"TunnelBear is an elegant, easy mobile VPN that keeps you safe.\"\n  - Lifehacker\n\n\"The app is bursting with charm, but it also delivers security at a good price.\"\n  - PCMag\n\n\"All you have to do is turn the switch to \"ON\" and you are protected.\"\n  - WSJ\n\n\"TunnelBear, the gorgeous VPN app that wants to bring online privacy to everyone.\"\n  - VentureBeat\n\nPRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE:\n*Spoiler alert* TunnelBear has a strict no-logging policy.

      "label": "Yandex Mail is a reliable email solution for work and personal correspondences with a built-in translator. Your emails will be safe thanks to built-in virus protection and spam blocking. Work with emails and attachments at any time on any device, and connect all your email accounts.\n\n• No frills. Unsubscribe from all unnecessary mailing lists at once by selecting them in the general address list. You don't have to open unwanted emails anymore to unsubscribe from the mailing list.\n• The app supports working with multiple email accounts at the same time, including Mail, Google, Outlook, Yahoo, Rambler, and iCloud. Read emails from different mailboxes in the same app.\n• All email attachments, including photos and documents, are automatically saved to the Yandex Disk cloud and are accessible from any device.\n• You can work with Yandex Mail without an internet connection. For example, if you lose your connection in the metro, you can still read emails and reply to them, and your messages will be sent automatically when you're back online.\n• Work with email on the go: see attachments, listen to an email if you're busy, and respond with a template message in one touch. Yandex Mail has a built-in translator for incoming and outgoing messages. You can read an email in a foreign language without any difficulties.\n• Protect yourself from hacking and spam. To prevent others from reading your emails, enable PIN code login. Yandex Mail smart algorithms reliably protect you from unwanted mailing lists.\n• Video meetings by link and Calendar. With Telemost, you can arrange work conferences and family chats. Make video calls on any device with no time restrictions. Organize calls directly in the Yandex Disk app without having to switch to Zoom, Skype, WhatsApp, or any other services. And if you add a meeting to Yandex Calendar, all participants will receive a reminder email.\n• An exclusive address. Connect Yandex 360 Premium to choose a unique address with your name or what you do. An exclusive address lets people know the line of work you're in. For example: alex@business-design.ru. Your email will stand out and get extra attention.\n• Backups. Restore emails, no matter what happens. For example, if you accidentally lose an important correspondence, it can be restored up to 6 months later, not just 1 month. Email and folder backups are available with Yandex 360 Premium plans. Backups save an unchanged copy of your correspondences.\n\nYandex Mail is a Russian email service — an alternative to Mail, Gmail, iCloud, and Rambler. Yandex Mail users get 5 GB of free cloud storage on Yandex Disk.\nYandex Mail data is securely stored in multiple copies in different data centers in Russia, so you'll always have access to your files."

Was it voluntarily or maybe someone just deactivated their account? Headaches and worries in the past, Yupi does everything for you!\n\nJust imagine how much time you save by not creating a list of followers, trying to figure out who started following and who unfollowed. All these tables and lists would drive anyone crazy, and still will not give a clear understanding of, for example, when exactly a person stopped following your profile.\n\nAs soon as you install Yupi, app immediately starts watching all changes in your activity, with an accuracy of a second. The application notifies you not only about followers and unfollowers, but also shows detailed statistics of your stories, who watched your Instagram stories, how many times, which story is the most popular, and which, on the contrary, is not popular at all. Have you been unfollowed? Unfollow them back! Or maybe you have devoted fans? It's just so easy to find out, Yupi makes a separate list of those who follow you without following them back.\nAnd that's not all. Yupi enlarges your profile pictures in no time. Zoom the profile picture with one click, now you don't have to peer into a small image.\n\nYou can contact for support info@yupireport.com\n\nInformation about the auto-renewable nature of the subscriptions\nEvery time you can reach your updated reports and if you want to continue getting reports, your subscription should be continued.\nSubscription periods are 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. Every month, 6 months or year your subscription renews.\n1 month subscription price is $4.99. 6 Months Subscription price is $18.99. 1 year price is $24,99.\nSubscriptions will automatically renew unless cancelled at least one day before the renewal date within 24 hours before the end of the current period.\nPayment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.\nIf you subscribe before a free trial ends, the remainder of the trial period will be forfeited.\nYou can manage and cancel your subscription by going to your account settings in the App Store\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://yupireport.com/privacy-policy\nTerms and Conditions: https://yupireport.com/terms\nEULA: https://yupireport.com/eula\n\nThis app only provides analytics for your instagram account.

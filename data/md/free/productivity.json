      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

      "label": "MEGA provides user-controlled encrypted cloud storage that’s accessed with web browsers and dedicated apps for mobile devices. Unlike other cloud storage providers, your data is encrypted and decrypted by your client devices only and never by us.\n\nUpload files from your smartphone or tablet, then search, store, download, stream, view, share, rename or delete them any time, from any device, anywhere. Share folders with your contacts and see their updates in real time.\n\nMEGA’s strong and secure end-to-end encryption means we cannot access or reset your password. You MUST remember your password and make sure to back up your account Recovery Key. Losing your password and the account Recovery Key will result in lost access to your files.\n\nUse the included MEGA Secure Chat for end-to-end-encrypted communications, including video and audio calls, with total privacy. Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency. The code of our iOS mobile app is located at: https://github.com/meganz/ios\n\nSubscriptions renew automatically for successive periods of the same duration at the same price as the initial period chosen. You can cancel the automatic renewal of your MEGA Pro subscription no later than 24 hours before your next subscription payment is due, via your iTunes account settings page. To manage your subscriptions, tap on the App Store icon on your device, sign in with your Apple ID at the bottom of the page (if you haven’t already done so) and then tap View ID. You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions. From there, you can select your MEGA Pro subscription and view your scheduled renewal date, choose a different subscription package or toggle the on-off switch to off to disable the auto-renewal of your subscription.\n\nTerms of Service: https://mega.io/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://mega.io/privacy"

Your emails will be safe thanks to built-in virus protection and spam blocking. Work with emails and attachments at any time on any device, and connect all your email accounts.\n\n• No frills. Unsubscribe from all unnecessary mailing lists at once by selecting them in the general address list. You don't have to open unwanted emails anymore to unsubscribe from the mailing list.\n• The app supports working with multiple email accounts at the same time, including Mail, Google, Outlook, Yahoo, Rambler, and iCloud. Read emails from different mailboxes in the same app.\n• All email attachments, including photos and documents, are automatically saved to the Yandex Disk cloud and are accessible from any device.\n• You can work with Yandex Mail without an internet connection. For example, if you lose your connection in the metro, you can still read emails and reply to them, and your messages will be sent automatically when you're back online.\n• Work with email on the go: see attachments, listen to an email if you're busy, and respond with a template message in one touch. Yandex Mail has a built-in translator for incoming and outgoing messages. You can read an email in a foreign language without any difficulties.\n• Protect yourself from hacking and spam. To prevent others from reading your emails, enable PIN code login. Yandex Mail smart algorithms reliably protect you from unwanted mailing lists.\n• Video meetings by link and Calendar. With Telemost, you can arrange work conferences and family chats. Make video calls on any device with no time restrictions. Organize calls directly in the Yandex Disk app without having to switch to Zoom, Skype, WhatsApp, or any other services. And if you add a meeting to Yandex Calendar, all participants will receive a reminder email.\n• An exclusive address. Connect Yandex 360 Premium to choose a unique address with your name or what you do. An exclusive address lets people know the line of work you're in. For example: alex@business-design.ru. Your email will stand out and get extra attention.\n• Backups. Restore emails, no matter what happens. For example, if you accidentally lose an important correspondence, it can be restored up to 6 months later, not just 1 month. Email and folder backups are available with Yandex 360 Premium plans. Backups save an unchanged copy of your correspondences.\n\nYandex Mail is a Russian email service — an alternative to Mail, Gmail, iCloud, and Rambler. Yandex Mail users get 5 GB of free cloud storage on Yandex Disk.\nYandex Mail data is securely stored in multiple copies in different data centers in Russia, so you'll always have access to your files."

This view organizes your inbox around your favorite stores and the categories you shop. Now, find all your favorite deals—without the clutter.\n\n• Keep tabs on your free trials\nGet reminders before free trials expire—so you can update your subscription plan or cancel before the subscription trial ends. \n\n• Customize your notifications\nChoose which notifications you really need and say bye-bye to the ones you don't.

There is nothing superfluous in the VK Mail app, such as ads. Just what you need for comfortable work with emails. \n\nSmart sorting. VK Mail automatically sorts newsletters, notifications from social nets, news and emails to yourself into folders. Everything is neatly organized and easy to find. \n\nCustom filters. Set your own filters for a clean and orderly inbox. You can set them so that emails from the selected senders are moved straight to dedicated folders or trash and are marked as read. \n\nThe unsubscribe wizard. All your newsletters are collected on one page to make it easy to unsubscribe from the ones you don't need. Go to your account settings, select \"Manage Newsletters\" and unsubscribe from those newsletters which you don't read. \n\nReliable protection. Powerful spam filters and email login confirmation via SMS, PIN, Touch ID or Face ID. You can choose an access protection method in the app settings and settings for personal data. \n\nAll email accounts in one place. If you already have an account with Mail.ru, Gmail, Yahoo, Yandex or another service, connect them in the VK Mail app and switch between them in a couple of taps. To add an account, tap “”Account” and “+”. \n\nQuick swipe actions. You can work with emails without even opening them! Swipe the message from left to right and select an action for this gesture: delete the message, mark it as read or move to spam. \n\nSending large files. You can attach an entire movie or all photos from your vacation to an email: VK Mail can send files up to 2GB without compressing them and turning them into links. \n\nCool themes from VK. Themes from VK will help you express your style and give your inbox an appealing look without distracting attention from emails. And there is also a dark theme to make reading emails at night more comfortable. You can choose a design in the account settings. \n\nCatchy address. Come up with a terse and expressive name with the domain @vk.com, and your email will be easy to remember — both for you and your recipients. \n\nDownload VK Mail, configure it as you like, and use it as a single email client for accounts from any services: Gmail, Yandex, Rambler, Mail.ru and many others."

      "label": "Watchsmith lets you personalize your Apple Watch like never before.  \n\nIt starts with a wide collection of highly customizable complications, which range in function from date, to weather, to astronomy.  Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance.  \n\nThis set of complications can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your watch face following rules you define.  For example, a particular complication slot could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your work day, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day.  This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your watch face without the need to constantly switch back and forth between faces.  \n\nThe Apple Watch app itself also includes a wide collection of tools and functions, such as a weather app, a workout app, a timezone converter, games and a calendar. Watchsmith provides one tap access to what you need, right when you need it.\n\nNotes:\n • Watchsmith is intended for use with a paired Apple Watch, which is where your configured complications will be displayed.  It requires watchOS 7.\n • Watchsmith optionally integrates with Apple Health.  This data is used during workouts to display your workout metrics, to show a summary of your daily heart rate date, and your activity.  Permission for Watchsmith to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.  \n• Watchsmith includes an optional premium subscription.  This is offered on a monthly or annual basis.  If you choose to purchase a subscription your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\n• Access to Tide and Weather hosted data is only available to Watchsmith Premium subscribers.\n\nPrivacy Policy & Terms: \nhttps://david-smith.org/watchsmith_privacy.html"

No ads either.\n- 56 different voices\n- 38 languages\n- Adjust volume, pitch, and rate\n- Save frequent phrases to Favorites\n- Background Audio implemented so the text reader can continue playing even when your phone is locked.\n- Email Support.

Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

      "label": "Rated 5 stars and loved by thousands of users!\nUnlike traditional complicated budgeting apps, Daily Budget Original focuses on being simple, easy and actually fun to use.\n\nThis PRO version includes all paid features of the free version (yellow icon). \n\n-- SAFE & PRIVATE –-\nThe app does not connect to bank accounts, so there is no need to enter your online banking log in data.\nAlso, we do not sell user data.  The data stays on your device only.  If you want to sync your data, you can encrypt it before uploading it to the cloud.\n\n-- USER REVIEWS –-\nBeyond spectacular! - This app is so fantastic- as with many other reviewers, I've tried other budgeting apps like Mint. But this is the only app that actually works. It incentives me to spend less money on some days, have extra to spend on the weekends. Thank you for not adding too many bells and whistles!\n\nLife Changing - I am the WORST with finances and I've tried other apps, including Mint, which I used for a week and quit. But this app?? It's amazing. I can't speak highly enough of how much this app is getting my life together. I'm aggressively saving, paying off all of my bills and I know exactly what I get to spend a day. I will never NOT use this. I hope it's here forever.\n\nHelps you be Accountable - This app turns my financial life into a game that I feel I can win.  Daily Budget really works and it's core design sets it apart from other apps.\n\n-- IN MEDIA –-\n“Take the blah out of budgeting” – Seventeen Magazine\n “An utterly fantastic approach to saving” – Apppicker\n“Super-quick, easy way to show how well we're doing” - Appadvice\n\n-- HOW IT WORKS --\n1. Enter your regular income, like salary or monthly allowance.\n2. Enter your recurring expenses, like rent or gym.\n3. Enter your saving goal, like 10%.\n4. Watch your Daily Budget gets calculated and know how much you can spend every day!\n*Daily Budget is calculated simply as:  (Income – Expenses – Saving)/Number of days in a month. \nWatch your budget grow as you stay below your daily budget.  Now, saving money is suddenly a fun game!"

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

Very easily:\nit always shows you exactly how much money you have left at any time!\nIt is fast, very easy to use and still looks damn good.\nOnce set up, you can add new expenses with just one click and the app will immediately calculate your remaining balance.\n\nForget the other apps. These are usually too packed, too complicated and too cumbersome to use.\nTake OhMyMoney, enter your income and fixed costs once, categorize your expenses and that's all you have to do. The app does it all, month after month.\n\nWhat does OhMyMoney offer you?\n\n- Immediate display of the remaining money that you still have available for the current month on a nicely prepared overview page. Here your income, your fixed costs and your expenses are listed and offset directly.\n\n- Predefined groups for your income, fixed costs and regular expenses\n\n- Self-defining category groups for your expenses (such as purchases, gas or pets). So you can separate them all and you get a much better overview.\n\n- iOS 14 Homescreen widgets that show you your groups and with just one click you can immediately add new expenses without having to open the app every time. IOS 14.1 or higher is required to use the iOS14 widgets.\n\n- Automatic transfer of your remaining money at a change of month. So you don't have to remember at the end of the month how much money you still had in your account. No, OhMyMoney will automatically transfer it and save it in your income group. So don't worry if you forget to look into the app at the end of the month!\n\n- Monthly statistics of all expenses for the current and last month, but also annual statistics for all past months, nicely presented in various charts. So you can easily compare the expenses of the current month with those of the last month, or see an approximate trend of how much money you are spending in each group per month.\n\n- Separate saving function in which you can define a savings goal and record every money you put aside for it.\n\n- Separate budget function. You can use it to create a budget, such as the vacation fund, and there you can record all costs during your vacation that have nothing to do with your actual expenses.\n\n- Create your own design! Choose from all possible colors and combine them to your personal background.\n\n- Feedback function. Have you found a bug or have you suggestions for improvement? Then write to me directly from the app and let me know!\n\n- No registration required, no internet required. You can use the app at any time and don't have to worry about losing your data.\n\n- Automatic backup in the iCloud. You can activate the backup function in the settings under iCloud and the app creates a backup in the background for you at regular intervals. So if you ever need to restore your iPhone, your data is backed up. These are also taken with you when you transfer them to a new device and are not lost.\n\n\nWhat do you have to do?\n\n- Enter your income and fixed costs once.\n- Categorize your expenses once and create groups.\n- Activate widgets or place them on the home screen.\n\nFinish. So easy. So fast."

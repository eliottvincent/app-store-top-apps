      "label": "Featured in Watercolor Artist Magazine, Artists Magazine, LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\n\nDa Vinci Eye is the essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills."

      "label": "Yes, this app will help you draw like a pro!\n\nWhether you're drawing on paper with a pencil, or cookies with royal icing, Camera Lucida will help you become a better artist.\n\nBe sure to read the reviews and the functionality you get with Camera Lucida!  There are lots of competitors and we know Camera Lucida costs a bit more, but no other app comes anywhere close to matching the functionality you get with 12 years of software development and refinement!\n\nUnlike hundreds of apps that enable you to create digital art, Camera Lucida instead enables you to create amazing physical art!  Our app works by having your iPhone or iPad's camera pointed at your drawing surface.  By watching your screen as you draw, you will be able to to see your reference image superimposed with your drawing - guiding your hand as little or as much as you want while you create your art.  Better than a projector and more versatile than a light table, Camera Lucida has been fine-tuned for over a decade to provide artists with the features they need to be accurate and creative.\n\nFor over a century, artists have made use of the camera lucida optical device to superimpose a live view of their subject onto their drawing or painting surface.  Allowing the artist to trace what they see in front of them, the camera lucida is an invaluable aid in creating a lifelike and realistic drawing.  Truly a camera lucida for the 21st century!\n\nWith our Camera Lucida iPhone/iPad application, artists and non-artists alike can now draw anything they have a photo of.  When looking at your screen, you'll be able to simultaneously see the image you want to draw as well as your drawing surface as you create your work of art.  Camera Lucida isn’t a projector, instead the app shows you a virtual image and you draw by watching your paper and hand on the screen as you draw!  It’s really clever and cool!\n\nWith over 12 years of continuous development, Camera Lucida's functionality eclipses the competition.  Check out these features:\n   -  Advanced image filters to help you see with an artist's eye.\n   -  Multi-device support to enable you to stream live video of your drawing to a second device.  *Requires iOS 10.3 or higher to receive hosted video.  Also, newer devices are recommended due to the processing requirements.*\n   -  Support for saving and restoring sessions, including automatically realigning your camera, sketch and reference image.\n   -  Full color palette control, including using your own paints, markers, etc.\n   -  Use any camera on your device and adjust for tilted and mirrored setups manually, or use an in-app purchase do do it automatically.\n   -  Secondary video feed support to enable you to draw from a live subject, not just a photograph.   *Requires iOS 10.3 or higher to receive hosted video.*\n   -  Time-lapsed recordings of you creating your drawing you can share on social media.  \n   -  Support for external bluetooth keyboards to aid in creating large art through mirroring your display.\n   -  Advanced tools such as vertical split screen sliders, timed image fading in and out, etc.\n   -  A projector mode that can be used when you’re using the app with a projector.\n   -  Video tutorials you can watch from within the app or from YouTube.\n   -  A full user manual available from within the app.\n   -  Continued support for iOS all the way back to 9.3 with only minor restrictions on functionality.\n   -  Customer support that you can count on and an active user community for inspiration.\n\nTo use our application, you just place your iPhone or iPad between your drawing surface and your eyes and trace what you see on the screen!\n\nIMPORTANT:  To use Camera Lucida, you need to fix your iPhone or iPad in place above your drawing.  We use a stack of books or a flower vase to do this.  Tutorials are included in the app to help you get started.  Also, some advanced functions such as receiving the multi-device video feed require iOS 10.3 or higher.\n\nContact: lucidaPete@gmail.com"

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "***  Hot Air has been featured in the Ballooning Journal  twice!  ***  \n\nHot Air is a flight logging and tracking application made especially for hot air balloon pilots! It's like having a log book and data recorder in your pocket! Hot air is loaded with lots of different features; many based on pilot feedback from around the world.\n\n---------------------------\nMajor Features:\n---------------------------\n\n- Real-time tracking! Great for improving situationally awareness, see your current location on a map or satellite imagery\n\n- Waypoints to show your distance, bearing, and ETE to a target location\n\n- Offline maps available\n\n- Record your entire flight path (you can even turn your screen off during recording)! Then you can export your flight to your computer and view it in 3D using Google Earth\n\n- KML/KMZ overlays! Add custom overlay data to the real-time flight maps (can be used to map out electric lines, friendly or unfriendly places to land, denoting special airspaces, include information such as radio frequencies or phone numbers, etc.).\n\n- Wind data tracking - records wind speed and direction at the various altitudes as you fly\n\n- Integration of the Glympse location sharing service to allow ground crew, family, or others to track your flight in real-time. They can track you using almost any device with a data connection. \n\n- Flight Log- the log makes it easy to track information common to all pilots such as crew members, passengers, maximum envelope temperature, and propane used. The log also makes saving takeoff and landing locations convenient, thanks to the iPhone’s GPS or triangulation capabilities; plus, it has a \"favorites\" list for takeoff locations. The log can also aid in flight planning and separates future flights from past flights using a simple color-coding scheme. \n\n- Flight Data Summary: this tab quickly tallies flights and hours flown. The summary includes a total of all flights or just the ones made within the past 90 days. Plus a summary of the crew used for past flights.\n\n- Summary Map: on the map tab, the logged flights that have a saved takeoff and landing location can be plotted and compared on an interactive map \n\n- Data export: export your flight log in HTML, KML (for viewing in Google Earth), and GPX (GPS Exchange)\n\n- Data backup and restore - to be certain your data is safe!\n\n- Comprehensive payload calculator\n\n- Measure Tool\n\n- View weather conditions and forecasts from within the app\n\n- Universal app - works on iPad (landscape and portrait) as well as the iPhone and iPod touch! \n\n- Facebook integration - it is easy to post a quick summary of your latest flight to Facebook and even includes a link to a map! \n\n- Real-time tracking heading projection-line option\n\n---------------------------\nThis app includes translations in English, French, Czech, and Slovak!\n---------------------------\n\nNote: During real-time flight mode the GPS is continuously running in the background which can significantly decrease battery life."

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

It's dead simple: just provide the server and script and this app will do the rest.\n\nSendLocation supports background updating. The application doesn't even need to be open to get location updates. However when SendLocation is closed or in background it detects only \"significant\" location changes (a new feature in iOS 4). These changes are typically occuring when changing cell in your mobile network.\n\nBy creating your own script you can .. \n- publish your location in your own webpage \n- make your own \"locate my iPhone\" service \n- send email to your friend when you're nearby \n.. use this information for any nice idea that pops in to your mind!\n\nThe HTTP GET-method is in following format:\n\nhttp://yourserver.com/yourscript.php?lat=***&lon=***&speed=***&heading=***&vacc=***&hacc=***&altitude=***&deviceid=**&battery=***&ts=***&quick=***&background=***\n\nWhere you must provide the \"http://yourserver.com/yourscript.php\" part to application settings.\n\nSpeed is your current speed in meters per second (calculated by GPS points) and heading is the course youre travelling towards (also calculated from GPS).\n\nNotice: when this app is at foreground it can send your location in 5 second intervals. This might stress some servers or cause lots of traffic to your server. Please monitor the usage!"

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

      "label": "PlaceTrack is a modern, powerful, full-featured location journaling and sharing app for iPhone. It keeps a history of your locations with speed, course, altitude, and user activity data, lets you track your loved ones, check the speed they are travelling, get directions to their current location or view a street level picture of any place they are or they have been. You can also overlay and compare your contacts location against a GPX track: import from files, Strava or Apple Watch workout routes (the app integrates with HealthKit)\n\nMain features include:\n- safe location sharing with the people you trust, in real time\n- live data: force a contact’s device to immediately send a fresh location\n- passive and battery friendly: run in the background with no noticeable impact on battery life, location is periodically updated as the device moves\n- context data: location data can include location history, speed and course, altitude, whether you’re walking, running, moving in a vehicle or resting\n- you are in control: set who sees your current location or who has access to your location history with fine-grained access controls\n\nOther features: \n- excellent battery usage: PlaceTrack uses SLC mode (Significant Location Change) and region monitoring, NOT continuous background. PlaceTrack is suspended in the background most of the time and is woken up only when you move significantly (detected using cell towers signal); most of the time it just sleeps and the GPS hardware is powered off to preserve battery. Install the app and forget about it\n- save your location history for later viewing\n- optionally share your recent location or location history with authorized PlaceTrack contacts\n- forced contact location updates: you can ask for a live location update from a contact and the backend platform will silently ask your contact device for a new location update \n- delayed sync: stores your locations when network is unreachable and pushes them to the PlaceTrack servers when you're back online \n- in-app streetview images\n- track overlays: import route data from Apple Watch, Strava and GPX files\n- location sharing works using address book phone numbers: your phone number is authenticated through an sms code on your first activation \n- your data, including your phone number and location, is always sent on a secure connection (ssl) and is never shared with any third party"

Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

Sei il benvenuto.\nPrima di partire, però, devi sapere che in molte città italiane, a differenza di quelle europee, esistono delle zone urbane in cui è impossibile accedere con l'automobile. Le Zone a Traffico Limitato (ZTL) sono sorvegliate dai vigili urbani e protette da telecamere che controllano gli accessi. Alcune di esse sono in funzione 24 ore su 24, altre vengono aperte agli automobilisti solo per alcune ore al giorno.  Se per caso dovessi accedere in una di queste zone, saresti costretto a pagare una multa che va dagli 80,00 euro ai 335,00 euro. Lo sappiamo, ti sembrano cifre assurde ma in Italia le regole sono queste.\nNon preoccuparti più del dovuto, però!  Scarica ZTL Italia e parti sicuro e informato. \nQuest'app è l'unica che contiene una mappa aggiornata con tutte le ZTL d'Italia. Facilissima ed attendibile, funziona come un navigatore. Grazie ad un sistema di allarme personalizzato, ogni volta che ti avvicinerai ad una ZTL una voce ti avvertirà in tempo e ti dirà se la zona è aperta o chiusa. Puoi avere ZTL Italia anche nel centro notifica del tuo smartphone o Tablet perché include il widget. \n\nVisita l'Italia senza brutte sorprese, scarica ZTL Italia e buon viaggio!\n\n*** Ultimo aggiornamento varchi: 29 Marzo 2017 ***"

      "label": "Boat Beacon is an internet AIS receiver and transmitter for your iPhone and iPad. It is the only AIS ship tracking app to provide Collision Warnings, share your boat’s position & use real-time AIS data.\n\nConnected to the largest network of AIS shore receivers world-wide covering most major ports, harbours and popular coastal areas.\n\n“An outstanding app, with great potential. Both interesting to use and very user friendly. This could be a life saver and especially of interest to small boat users. Everyone who goes on the water should have this on and use it!”  ***** Sun Dream, App Store Review\n\nBoat Beacon is specifically designed for boaters & provides continuous Bearing, Range & Closest Point of Approach (CPA) calculations and alarms in addition to standard AIS information even when in the background.\n\nBoat Beacon does not require any external AIS transponder or receiver equipment.\n\nKey Features\n------------\nOver-the-horizon collision avoidance (30 miles radius) using continuous CPA calculations - highlights boats that are on a potential collision course and alerts you with an alarm.\n\nContinually transmits and receives position information via the internet and calculates and alarms CPA even when the app is in the background.\n\nShares your position with Internet AIS Systems and apps and other Boat Beacon users in real time.\n\nReal time ship map view with North up and Heading up modes so you can look in the direction of the ships on the map to locate them.\n\nNav display showing own boat's speed, course, heading and position.\n\nMan Overboard tracking, SART Alarm, Anchor watch and Theft alarms.\n\nApple Watch App included\n\nExport tracks\n\nBoat-to-Boat & Boat-to-Group Messaging. \n\nLocal AIS and GPS via Wifi.\n\nBoat Beacon InApp Add-ons:-\n\nLiveView - Augmented Reality Camera view with ships, compass & horizon overlaid. Works with FLIROne Infra-red cameras as well to see ships & people in the dark & through fog (IAP)\n\n\"AIS Sharing\" to other apps like Navionics & iNavX (IAP subscription)\n\nUS, UK and IE Marine raster charts  (IAP).\n\nLet Friends and Family see where you are and where you're headed to with our free Boat Watch app or on web-based AIS systems like MarineTraffic which have free web viewers available.\n\nArm all the crews in a race with Boat Beacon and have real time updates on the race positions on the water and back in the club house.\n\nKeep a watch and in touch with other boats in your flotilla when sailing in a group.\n\nBoat Beacon requires internet access to work. Most popular coastal areas have cellular data access extending 12 or more miles out to sea. \n\nSubscriptions\nThe \"AIS Sharing \" subscription is monthly ($5.99) or yearly ($16.49), and will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase, and will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the iTunes account holder and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase.  No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nTerms of Use: http://seanav.net/termsofuse.php\n\nPrivacy Policy: http://seanav.net/privacy.php\n\nSupport: help@pocketmariner.com\n\nYour position can be shared and seen on all our apps without using an MMSI number. To be seen on Global AIS systems like MarineTraffic you will need an MMSI number. In the US you can obtain one  by visiting http://www.boatus.com/mmsi or email us for a free internet MMSI number.\n\nPlease note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNOT FOR NAVIGATION\nBoat Beacon should only be used for basic navigation reference and should not be solely relied upon to determine precise locations, proximity, distance, or direction. You will not be visible to other ships on VHF only AIS systems."

      "label": "SkyLogger is a program for obtaining and storing flight data. The program is especially adapted for the usage by glider, hangglider and paraglider pilots.  SkyLogger obtains the geodetic positions of the pilot during the flight and stores the data. Furthermore, the pilot is able to see during the flight the elapsed time, the distance to the take-off as well as the current ground speed and climb rate. A compass rose is indicating the current flight direction. \nFor competitions the pilot's and the aircraft's name, the aircraft's ID and the to be flown route can be entered.  During the flight the direction and distance to the next waypoint are shown on the display.\n\nAfter finishing the flight the stored geodetic data together with the data for the competition can be converted into the common IGC file format. Additionally, also other popular formats like GPX and KML are supported. The created files are stored on the iPhone or can be sent to servers or other computers.\n\nSkyLogger supports besides others the following features:\n\n - control by Apple Watch;\n - main data visualization on Apple Watch;\n - cockpit / instrument view;\n - 2D & 3D flight data visualization;\n - downloadable map data;\n - large and individually adaptable instruments on a moving map allow best viewing comfort;\n - north or in flight direction orientation of moving map;\n - live tracking support for Leonardo or Vgps servers\n - visualization of previously flown flights as track traces on moving map;\n - visualization of airspaces with user defined colors;\n - instrument showing the distance and direction to the closest airspace;\n - 3 axis acceleration measurements;\n - tracked flights are stored in highly efficient internal database;\n - default flight parameters can be stored and retrieved to make flight information entering for competitions easier;\n - SkyLoggerXXL supports common file formats like IGC, CSV, GPX and KML;\n - IGC files created by SkyLoggerXXL are OLC conform and can directly be sent to Leonardo, XCCup, XContest and XC globe based OLC servers;\n - calculation of XC points for FAI triangle, triangle and free distance over 5 points;\n - XC analysis (determination of FAI triangle areas);\n - printing of flightbooks, flight information and statistics\n - all diagrams, maps or charts can either be e-mailed or copied for incorporation into other apps;\n - integration of SkyView database for exchanging waypoints;\n - support of FlyNet accessories;\n - support of SensBox;\n - weather data history of selected weather stations for the last 48 hours;\n - online wind speed and direction visualization on maps for selected weather stations;\n - visualization of hotspots;\n - visualization of regions with thermals;\n - visualization of climb rate traces;\n - and much much more!\n\nWarning: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

We love this mode! We found it much more convenient compared to traditional car dashboards (especially on the roads of Western Europe, which are full of speed cameras and where you need to watch your speedometer all the time). And last but not the least - it just looks cool.  Note: this mode works pretty well at night time and twilight, but on direct sunlight the screen brightness can be insufficient.\n\n- \"aSmart HUD\" can keep track on 4 speed limits, giving a warning (sound and visual) each time you crossing it. Normally, it's legal speed limits within cities, local roads and high-speed motorways. \"Never exceed speed\" is the speed you should not exceed under any conditions. For example, it can be a technical limit of your vehicle or the point where government can arrest your driving license. \n\n- You can skip/rewind/play/pause your current iPod music track, select the playlist or set the Shuffle or Repeat iPod mode.\n\n- Weather forecast time intervals and temperature units (C, F) are selectable in Preferences.\n\n- You can quickly take a photo of what's going on the road. Photo will be automatically saved into the Photos Album. The speedometer image, map and a some of other useful information will be placed over your photo. \n\n- Landscape and Portrait screen layouts support.\n\n- Three different compass styles, sound themes, colors, etc.\n\n- 4 functionally different display themes.\n\n- Speed history log chart. \n\n- \"Location Info\"  - longitude and latitude, GPS measurement precision and some more data.\n\n- \"Records\" screen (left upper button on the \"Location Info\" screen), where you can see your maximum reached speed (during the current trip or all of your trips), maximum altitude and maximum distance from start.\n\n- Tap the speed indicator to switch into speed fullscreen mode. \n \nIMPORTANT: for more screenshots and details visit the http://atoll-ordenadores.com website\n\nLimitations \n- The precision is affected by the satellite signal quality. If unsure, use the program only for reference, don't rely on it for 100%. Application requires real A-GPS chip - so, no iPod and not-3G iPad supported. On iPad 3G application function only in \"double pixel\" mode.\n\nThanks to everyone for your suggestions about additional functionality! THE BEST AND FASTEST WAY TO CONTACT US IS SENDING YOUR REQUESTS AND BUG REPORTS to support@atoll-ordenadores.com. WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED  IN DIALOG, what is not possible when you leaving the bug-report as AppStore review."

      "label": "***YoNav! uses the most accurate GPS technology available on the iPhone, it will not work indoors.***\n\n***If YoNav! seems unresponsive make sure you are outside with a clear view of the sky and that you have location services activated for YoNav!.  Press \"Go!\" and select your tracking method.  Sometimes it could take up to 60 seconds to acquire a signal.\n\n***If you have trouble, please send an email to support@yonav.net, we will get you working.\n\nYoNav! - A simple GPS app that just works!\n\nYoNav! leverages the latest features of the Apple Watch Series 2, 3, & 4 to put a cutting-edge waterproof standalone GPS on your wrist.  There is no need to be tethered to your iPhone anymore.  YoNav! on the Apple Watch Series 2, 3, & 4 is 100% stand alone for GPS tracking and telemetry.  What sets YoNav! apart is the efficiency of data.  There is no clutter, no complicated menus, just a GPS app that works.  \n\nYoNav! is a perfect GPS tracker for:\n--Sailing\n--Kiteboarding, surfing, or other water sports \n--Orienteering\n--Hiking\n\nUsing the latest features of the Apple Watch Series 2, 3, & 4, YoNav! can:\n--Track and map your activity by GPS\n--Display important telemetry during your activity \n--Export your tracks to GPX format for use in most major navigation software\n--Keep track of your sailing starts with a built-in timer that offers haptic feedback during the countdown.\n--Track your calories burned during your activity\n\nTrack and map your activity\nYoNav! will track and map your activity (on iPhone) using color coded tracks to show speed variations.  Tracking can be turned on and off from the watch.  Tracks can be uploaded to the iPhone once you are back in range.  All tracks can be exported off the iPhone in GPX format for use in most major navigation software apps.\n\nDisplay Important Telemetry\nAll the information you expect from a handheld GPS is at your fingertips.  YoNav! can display 1 to 8 separate data fields.  Available data fields are speed, course, bearing to waypoint, velocity made good, distance off course, distance to waypoint, and many others.  All telemetry can be displayed in the unit system of your choice.\n\nBuilt in Sailing Countdown Timer\nAre you a sailor?  Do you want to nail the perfect start?  Use the built-in timer to countdown from the duration you choose.  Haptic (vibration and sound) feedback occurs at intervals during the countdown.  The tracking automatically begins as soon as the timer reaches zero.  You can ensure your sailboat is moving at full speed at every start. \n\nLeave all the complicated electronics at home next time you are on water, in the mountains, or just on the go.  YoNav! can replace hand held GPS units with a simple yet very effective app.\n\nWhile the paired iPhone is in range, the GPS of the iPhone is used for tracking.  When the paired iPhone is not in range the GPS of the Apple Watch Series 2, 3, & 4 is used.  Please note that continued use of the GPS running in the background of either device can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nPrivacy Policy Summary: YoNav! collects calorie workout data while in operation on the Apple Watch and sends the workout data to Apple's Health app. It also collects and stores location information. Learn more about the YoNav! privacy policy at: https://yonav.net/yonav-gps-app-digital-privacy-policy/\n\nFor more information, please visit https://yonav.net"

It is estimated that Berlin has 710 bicycles per 1000 residents. Cyclists have access to 620 km of bicycle paths including approximately 150 km of mandatory bicycle paths, 190 km of off-road bicycle routes, 60 km of bicycle lanes on roads, 70 km of shared bus lanes which are also open to cyclists, 100 km of combined pedestrian/bike paths and 50 km of marked bicycle lanes on roadside pavements (or sidewalks).\n\nHamburg is noted for several festivals and regular events.  Regular sports events - some open to pro and amateur participants - are the cycling competition Vattenfall Cyclassics, the Hamburg Marathon, the biggest marathon in Germany after Berlin. The triathlon ITU World Cup event Hamburg City Man is also held in here.\n\nCycling is recognised as a good alternative to motorised transport and the growing numbers of bicycle lanes are widely used throughout the year. A modern bike hire system is available within the area bounded by the Mittlerer Ring. Munich, the third largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, is the city we are talking about.\n\nBy downloading the application you will find cycling routes not even to this three, but more Germany cities.

      "label": "Pro Altimeter uses the high-fidelity barometric pressure sensor in iOS devices to measure and compute altitude.\n\nPro Altimeter has a dead simple interface.  Barometric altitude and GPS altitude are displayed in large easy to read numbers, showing units of both feet and meters, and giving realtime accuracy estimates from the hardware.  At bottom are calibration and display mode buttons. The display offers a highly-readable daytime mode with black digits on an LCD-green background, and a reversed night mode that is easy on the eyes in dark conditions. That's it!\n\nProper calibration is necessary to measure altitude from barometric pressure (this is why a pilot \"dials in\" the cockpit altimeter before taking off). Pro Altimeter offers four different methods for calibration -- choose the easiest and most convenient:\n\n1. Use GPS altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with the altitude measured by GPS. This method can be used when your device has a clear line of sight to the sky and a reliable GPS fix with good accuracy.\n\n2. Manually enter altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with known altitude from landmarks, elevation benchmarks, trail markers, topo maps, land surveys, etc.  Altitude can be entered in feet or meters.\n\n3. Manually enter pressure.  If you have a weather station, weather report, or METAR report with equivalent sea level pressure for a nearby location, this can be used to correlate local barometric pressure to altitude.  Pressure can be entered with units of inches Hg, kPa, or mb. \n\n4. Check local airports.  With the tap of a button, Pro Altimeter will locate the five closest airports within 100 miles (160km) of your present location anywhere in the world, and pull in METAR data.  From that list of five, pick the airport of your choice and Pro Altimeter will import pressure data for calibration.\n\nOnce calibrated, Pro Altimeter keeps track of the time since its last calibration.  Because weather and local barometric pressure change over time, the app will warn you when 6 hours have elapsed since the last calibration by flashing the \"CALIBRATE\" button.  You should calibrate as frequently as practical -- for example, on a hike, calibrate whenever you pass a trail marker or elevation benchmark.  But at a minimum, calibrate at least every 6 hours or whenever weather changes in your area.\n\nPro Altimeter is intended for iOS devices with a built-in barometric pressure sensor (iPhone 6 and later, iPad Air 2 and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPad Pro).  On older devices without a barometric pressure sensor, only GPS altitude and accuracy will be displayed.  \n\nIf you have an Apple Watch, check out the new Pro Altimeter for Watch and get all this same functionality on your wrist!"

      "label": "Nav Camera uses the proven navigation, augmented reality, and image processing engines from the well known Theodolite app to create a new app that focuses on photogaphy and video recording with data overlays.  The app has been crafted with attention to detail by a top iOS developer, and benefits from over 10 years of development and testing heritage, along with real world usage by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world.\n\nNav Camera lets you take photographs and record movies in landscape and portrait orientations with geo-location overlays and custom notes.  Geo-location overlays include date, time, position, altitude, GPS datum, and compass bearing. Overlay data is updated in every frame when recording movies, which is great for documenting dynamic scenes or scanning an area.  You can enter up to four lines of custom notes to be rendered into the overlay, which is perfect for job descriptions, project names, company/staff information, invoice numbers, or additional comments/documentation.  Various parts of the overlay can be turned on or off, and multiple overlay colors are available.\n\nNav Camera includes features for serious users including multiple reticles (three types of crosshairs and an SLR-style focus/exposure indicator), colored lens filters to improve use in dark conditions and preserve night vision, and multiple position formats including military grid reference system (MGRS), universal transverse Mercator (UTM), British/Irish National Grids, and six latitude/longitude variations. The optional \"Datum Pack\" adds over 220 geodetic datums to the app for more accurate position and altitude computation from GPS data. Optional datums include NAD-27, NAD-83, OSGB-36, ED-50, and hundreds of others, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world. \n\nFind out why apps like Nav Camera and Theodolite, and their field-proven results, are featured in Apple Keynotes, written up in magazine articles and professional journals, and used by everyday explorers and pro users around the world. Where will you take Nav Camera on your next adventure? \n\nNav Camera works on any iPhone or iPod Touch with camera, running iOS 11.4 or later.  If you like Nav Camera, please leave a review/rating on the iTunes App Store.  It only takes a moment, and helps us a lot. Thanks!"

The User Guide section on Preparing Maps describes the process to prepare a plain image file for use as a location-calibrated and mobile-optimized map image.\n\nContinued use of the GPS running in the background can dramatically reduce battery life on the iPhone or iPad."

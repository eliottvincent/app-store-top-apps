A sharing extension allows you to add links from outside of Reeder.\n\n\nBIONIC READING\nA higher dimension of reading. With Bionic Reading you read texts with more focus, awareness, and sustainability. Read more about Bionic Reading at bionic-reading.com.\n\n\nWIDGETS\nView most recent articles, configurable to only show items from feeds, folders, searches (for services that support searches) or tags (for read later services).\n\n\nMARK AS READ ON SCROLL\nWith version 5, Reeder finally supports marking items as read while scrolling. Off by default, this can be enabled on a per-account basis.\n\n\nREADER VIEW\nEnter Reader View (for feed items and read later links that support this) for a clutter-free reading experience directly in Reeder's article viewer. You can enable \"Automatic Reader View\" on a per-feed basis to always load items of a feed with Reader View.\n\n\nSUPPORTED THIRD-PARTY SERVICES\nFeedbin, Feedly, Feed Wrangler, FeedHQ, NewsBlur, The Old Reader, Inoreader, BazQux Reader, FreshRSS, Instapaper and Pocket."

However, some sites set up their feeds to only show a portion of each entry, you know, to get you to click through to their actual website. We find that really annoying, and we're sure you do too.\n\nWhich is why, unlike other RSS feed readers, that either push you into a browser (in-app or otherwise), or depend on third party text parsing services and require you to be online to fetch the full text of one article at a time (which makes it no different from having to click/tap through to a website), in lire, you get your favorite RSS feeds as they should've been. You don't need to click through to any website (though, you do still have the option to, if you really wanted). It takes your favorite partial feeds, does its magic, and converts them in to full feeds, so you don't have to click/tap on those annoying 'Read more' or 'Continue reading' links.\n\nOnce they're cached, you don't even need to be connected to read your full-text feeds.\n\nUse as a standalone feed reader, sync with iCloud,\n\nor,\n\nsync with any of the several services: Feedly, Feedbin, FeedHQ, The Old Reader, Inoreader, BazQux Reader, Newsblur, Feed Wrangler, FreshRSS, Miniflux, Nextcloud News, Tiny Tiny RSS."

Go where no seismogram has gone before with a fascinating and mesmerizing look at the world's Earthquakes.\n\n- Eight different Earth display types that include population and tectonic plate maps.\n\n- Four different custom view 'presets'.\n\n- Solid and wire frame 3D views with transparent Earth ability. \n\n- A Sequencer that shows Earthquakes as they occurred using animation loops.\n\n- Control Speed, Decay, and Sound of Earthquake sequencer loops.\n\n- Includes 4000+ years of Historic Earthquake information.\n\n- Data from USGS, European EMSC, British Geological Survey, and New Zealand Geonet.\n\n- Current worldwide Volcano activity display..\n\n- Includes DEX depth visualization.\n\n- Individual quake indicator 'flags' that show magnitude or depth.\n \n- Tap on individual indicator 'flags' to show details for each Earthquake.\n\n- Earthquake details include Local Maps, Local News, and Advanced Seismic Information.\n\n- Can import up to four external Earth images that are supplied by the user.\n\n- Uses \"point and drag\" to position and spin the Earth. Uses \"pinching\" for zoom.\n\n- Filter Earthquakes by magnitude and age with slider controls.    \n\n- Earthquake angle indicators.\n\n- Automatic Refresh Timer\n\n- Retina enabled.\n\n- And much more...\n\n\nIn addition to providing several 'live' sources of current Earthquake information, an Atlas database is also included.   The Atlas database shows over 4000 years of Historic Earthquake information.  This database (updated periodically) is built-in to Earthquake 3D and is available even when you are off-line.\n\nThis edition of Earthquake 3D represents a third generation of this very popular computer program. Started in 2003 as a desktop application, it has become a widely adopted standard for video presentations and visualizations of Earthquake information. This latest edition brings new features and updates to this modern classic. Whether you are exploring the geo sciences, or you just want to find out if you felt that last quake, this app will keep you up to date with the latest Earthquake information."

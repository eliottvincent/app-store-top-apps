By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

Add and remove drills, or tweak times as your skills improve.\n\nFor each drill you are given a few seconds to prepare, then an audible \"Ready\" call. After a random pause, a short tone marks the drill start.  You should complete the drill before you hear the whistle. \n\nUse the strings feature to automatically decrease drill time as you practice.\n\nWe Include basic instructions how to complete each drill. This is especially helpful for complex drills like malfunction clearing.\n\nThis is the perfect companion for your trip to Front Sight, and a great way to keep the momentum going afterwards.\n\nHint: If you cannot hear the sounds, check your device's mute switch. ;-)"

Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

      "label": "The application Windsurfing now combines the maximum functionality necessary for your favorite sport:\n- calculation of equipment sizes\n- GPS tracker for recording races\n- Altimeter for recording the height of jumps\n- Track player for analysis of action\n- Importing tracks from other devices (*.sbp, *.sbn, *.gpx, *.tcx)\n- Exporting the video from player to social networks\n- Weather forecast for given spots on the map\n- Notifications about suitable weather forecast for 1-3 days\n- History of activity and export to Facebook\n\nMy Windsurf - it is a realistic tool for customizing your sports equipment! You specify your weight and level of training, and get the recommended sizes of equipment depending on the wind speed. The calculation is performed for two modes: freeride and slalom. The application uses new formula calculations, as close to the manufacturer's recommendations. Format sizes: boards in liters, sails in square meters, fins in centimeters.\n\nNow this is not just a helper in choosing the right size of equipment for specific wind conditions. MapKit framework was added to application for working with maps and the history of your actions is also preserved!\n\nThe maximum size of the sail is limited to 12.5 for freeride and 10.0 for slalom, because the bigger size is not supported by the manufacturer. For the present the level of training supports two modes: amateur and expert. Amateur mode provides slightly smaller sail in accordance with the calculation formula, slightly larger fin and limit displacement of the board (board size will not be less than the floatage limit). Expert mode means that you can ride on small boards, as at increasing wind estimated size of the board may be less than your weight.\n\nBy the instrumentality of Flat-Wave switch the current state of the surface water on the spot is set. This affects the size of the board. It is not a secret that many experienced riders try to use smaller board in a big chop, as it improves your control.\n\nTake into consideration that the calculation corresponds to the averaged data. It is impossible to take into account the abilities of each individual rider. You can always use either larger or smaller size of windsurf kit. There are many riders, skaters who use fairly large boards in rather strong wind, but if they use a smaller size board – they will sure like this, as they get more control over the windsurf kit and greater speed. In any case, we will respond to your comments and suggestions to improve the program and add the new facilities.\n \nIMPORTANT! The application is not intended for beginners, while learning your skills will improve and gradually you will  take the smaller board and  the larger sail\n\nThis app may use your location even when it isn’t open, which can decrease device battery life."

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

Manage and organize multiple teams fairly and efficiently, with less stress and more time to enjoy the truly rewarding experience that being a Soccer Dad brings. Click “...More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\nBest soccer app - *****\nby Ciaran O'Shaughnessy - Dec 11, 2010\n\n\"I have downloaded and tried maybe 15 or more apps to help manage games, players (rotations, time played etc) and track stats for players on my Recreational and Club team.\nWhile there are probably 3 that are worthwhile. One is good and has 90% of what I needed, but is not user friendly and difficult to use. The second is great and easy to use, but only has 80% of what I needed. This app has 99% of what anyone needs, is easy to use and is user friendly. In addition the developer is quick to respond and eager to find out what else would improve the product.\nI would have given this 10 stars as a rating, but unfortunately 5 is the most one can give.\"\n\nThe whistle blows and your team springs into action. As you watch them play, you can’t help but feel proud of those kids. They’ve come so far since the beginning of this year’s soccer season. Thankfully, as their coach, you have, too.\n\nWhen you first started coaching kids’ soccer, you manually made up schedules, juggled rotations, organized events and volunteers. You did it all, including reports and communicating with parents. It was a lot of work but seeing the kids improve and grow was satisfying and worth all that effort. Sadly, it didn’t give you much time to enjoy your role as much as you were hoping.\n\nThanks to the Soccer Dad app, you can now take care of all your team’s administration needs in a much easier way. You’ll be so organized and efficient, that you’ll enjoy coaching even more. Communicating with parents and players is a breeze too, because the app holds the full contact information of everyone you may need to get in touch with.\n\nEver need to schedule or reschedule games and practices? Of course you do. No problem, Soccer Dad can help you with that and will even mark the dates on your built-in iPhone calendar. You also have the option of having Soccer Dad issue reminders about those dates. \n\nJust look at how Soccer Dad can help you and your team:\n* Fairly and efficiently manage and organize multiple teams by season\n* Easy access of player contact information – quickly communicate with parents\n* Organize events and have them display in your iPhone calendar\n* Keep track of volunteers\n* Replace your stopwatch and clipboard – lets you know when it’s time to change players, even if it’s in your pocket.\n* Send emails without ever leaving the app\n* Use the camera and photo library for player pictures\n* Optimized for the iPhone and iPad retina display\n\nIf you’re one of those special people who coaches kids’ soccer, let this helper app make the season and administrative tasks a little more comfortable and less labor intensive. Then you’ll have time for what’s truly important – the kids.\n\nDownload Soccer Dad now.\n\nSee this App in action here:  http://www.youtube.com/soccerdadapp\n\n- Support -\n\nIf you have questions/issues/feedback regarding the app, please contact me through my support link below.\n\n(Unfortunately, I can't respond to App Store reviews because there's no way to contact reviewers.)"

Even if your are flying accidentally within a cloud or under poor visibility conditions!\n\nBy typing to „Alt 3“ - usually after the adjusting phase - or any time later you can reset „Alt 3“ to „0“.\n\nMoreover you can use the App to\n\n    - record you flights \n    - view your recorded flights in the integrated map view  \n    - send your recorded flights by mail as kml-files or gpx -files to your friends \n    \nOne last note: \nThe app reacts a little somewhat slower, as e.g. a Bräuninger- or Flytec Vario, if you use the internal pressure sensor of the iPhone, because the sensor doesn't provide data as often as an external sensor. \n\nThe app requires a good GPS signal, if no internal or external pressure sensor can be used. \n\nPlease make sure in any case, that you have a good GPS signal,  if you use the app. \nThe app does NOT work - completely and reliably - in buildings or other situations in which you have no or a bad GPS signal! \nHowever, this should not be a problem, since you usually flying under a clear open sky. ;-) \n\nUsage - without - an internal or external sensor is possible, but subject to known the limitations of a pure GPS operation, such as using only open-air, a good GPS signal and altitude changes > 5m with at least 1-2 m/s. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\nEven if the App is running in background, the GPS location service is used by the App, if you record your flight!"

If you something in your chassis setup or change the weather, race track, conditions - new settings data automatically will be saved in the history\n\n• Analysis: this tab contains three types of chassis behavior analysis\n\n- Driving analysis: you'll have to inform about how the driver feels the behaviour of the kart in corners. In section \"Behaviour in corners\" you'll have to enter information about what the driver is feeling of a go-kart chassis behavior (for example - understeering at entry of corners). These are the most important information used by the application to calculate the advices. You also should enter information about race track is clockwise or anti-clockwise, current weather and race-track conditions (automatic weather detection via the Internet is available). All elements are taking into consideration for calculations\n\n- Pressure analysis: you have to inform about the hot and cold pressures of each tyre, matherial of wheels (aluminium or magnesium), target tyre temperature, current weather and race-track conditions\n\n- Temperature analysis: you have to set in this screen the information about hot tyre temperatures in the inside, middle and outside of the patch of each tyre, matherial of wheels (aluminium or magnesium), target tyre temperature, current weather and race-track conditions\n\n- Temperature: you can set in this screen the information about hot tyre temperatures in the inside, middle and outside of the working surface\n\nThen click on the \"Analysis\" button and application will show you some recommendations related on which adjustments you can do to solve any problem in the chassis setup that you can be suffering. A screen with detailed information about the adjustment will be shown. For example: \"Insrease front track width\" or \"Modify tyres pressures\" (how much you should adjust your pressures) or change your driving style\n\n• Tools: on this tab, you can find useful karting utilities. Fuel calculator, for perfect fuel mixing. Weight and balance to get the perfect go-kart weight distribution. Air density and density altitude for carburetor setup (JETTING). And much more.\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, PSI and BAR for pressures, lb and kg for weights, millimeters and inches for length, mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg for atmospheric pressure, meters and foots for altitude, gallons, oz, ml and liters for volume."

      "label": "eVario is your connected flight navigation companion during and after your adventure trip, helping you to visualise relevant data, assist you while progressing in the air by returning visual and acoustical feedback.\n\neVario is a 9-axis measurement (accelerometer, gyrometer,  gps), barometer assisted, connected and intuitive instrument with a polychrom display, exploiting the embedded device’s hardware and accurate sensoric, without need to connect external devices. It typically provides real time information of a variometer like altimeter, speedometer, odometer, chronometer, gyrometer, anemometer for every (air)craft pilot. Its configurable cockpit allows you to keep track of the most relevant to you. The integrated data logger automatically records your 3D location and provides the recorded track file to e.g. your iCloud Drive for track visualisation or flight metrics.\n\nTurn on & Fly!\nNo need for additional/external hardware.\n\neVario is mainly designed for paragliding/hang-gliding, but may be used as well while biking, hiking, running, sailing, skiing, flying, …\n\nOptimised for low battery usage, the app lets you:\n▶ PLAN AHEAD: Check detailed weather conditions (emagram) over days for your safety, in Europe. Check surroundings and thermal hotspots on the topographic outdoor map. \n▶ PLAN LANDING: Set a marker e.g. at the landing area and get assistance when approaching.\n▶ TOUCH&GO: Turn on & Go fly!

      "label": "Harry's Dyno is a high precision performance measuring app. It utilizes GPS and OBD sensor input to recognize arbitrary speed ranges like 0-60 mph or 100-200 km/h. Both acceleration and deceleration testing is supported.\n\nResults can be compared and analyzed in details. Using two-cursor mode, one can inspect subranges of data recorded (e.g. 80 to 120 km/h for a 0 to 200 km/h). Data is stored locally and can be filtered by speed range and vehicle used. It can be exported to various data formats too.\n\nProvided the smartphone is mounted in a position with good GPS accuracy, the internal GPS can be used for measurements. For short speed ranges, high powered vehicles, and highest precision, either external GPS or OBD sensors can be connected. OBD adapters are actually preferable as speed changes are available instantly. We have an always up to date list of compatible accessories available here: www.gps-laptimer.de/compatibility/ios\n\nFor distance based performance testing (quarter mile etc), please use Harry's LapTimer currently. This mode will be added to Harry's Dyno as a free upgrade shortly.\n\nFor Harry's LapTimer users! Harry's LapTimer GrandPrix has received a free feature upgrade and includes Harry's Dyno functionality now: please follow LapTimer ‣ Race ‣ Performance to use the dyno mode. In case you have used Harry's LapTimer Petrolhead so far, you may either upgrade it to GrandPrix (LapTimer ‣ Administration ‣ Add-ons), or go for Harry's Dyno as a separate app.\n\nEnjoy and let us know what you think! For questions, tipps & tricks, and support, please use our forum www.gps-laptimer-forum.de"

The app provides a list of visual and kinesthetic cues for assessing and perfecting movement. The cues are organized by stroke and by arm, head and leg motion.  Cues are synchronized with the stroke animations. \n\nSwiping to the side changes the view: front, side, top, and bottom. There is a play button on the bottom of the screen and single-frame buttons to go forward or backward.\n\nA user selects a stroke and then chooses a swim cue or phase related to arm, head or leg position and movement.  Once a stroke and skill are selected, the user is given a specific swim cue that can be used to assess and improve a single aspect of swimming technique. The swim cues allow an individual to adjust his or her stroke using easy-to-follow directions.  A swimmer can master a single cue at a time to improve technique and swim faster.\n\nThe app also includes a stroke-specific link to the science/research supporting each cue."

      "label": "The application My Kite now combines the maximum functionality necessary for your favorite sport:\n- calculation of equipment sizes\n- GPS tracker for recording races\n- Altimeter for recording the height of jumps\n- Track player for analysis of action\n- Importing tracks from other devices (*.sbp, *.sbn, *.gpx, *.tcx)\n- Exporting the video from player to social networks\n- Weather forecast for given spots on the map\n- Notifications about suitable weather forecast for 1-3 days\n- History of activity and export to Facebook\n\nMy Kite - it is a realistic tool for customizing your sports equipment! You specify your weight and level of training, and get the recommended sizes of equipment depending on the wind speed. The application uses new formula calculations, as close to the manufacturer's recommendations. Format sizes: boards in centimeters, kites in square meters.\nNow this is not just a helper in choosing the right size of equipment for specific wind conditions. MapKit framework was added to application for working with maps and the history of your actions is also preserved!\nThe level of training supports two modes: amateur and expert. Expert mode provides a 10% larger kite, as with increasing your level, you will improve control over equipment and you'll need a little bit larger size to jump higher;)\nThe app lets you save all your equipment in the table. In this case, you can immediately see the most suitable set for the present weather conditions.\nTake into consideration that the calculation corresponds to the averaged data. It is impossible to take into account the abilities of each individual rider. You can always take a larger or smaller size of the equipment. It relates to the size of the board because it is very individual, especially when the level of your preparation increases.  This will depend on your style of riding, for example, you can take the bigger board than recommended and thus it will be enough to get smaller kite. In any case, we will respond to your comments and suggestions for improving the program and add new features to it.\n\nIMPORTANT: This application is not intended for beginners because in the training stage it will be better if experienced instructor chooses equipment for you!\n\nThis app may use your location even when it isn’t open, which can decrease device battery life."

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle position and spark plug type values are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs. Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude and relative horsepower are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tunning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine. We strongly advise you to adjust this value before the race in order to get an optimum performance. This value will be stored and used in the future sessions.\n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about the engine and the track, that is, the engine type (Senior, Junior, Minimax, Micromax, Supermax or DD2), the spark plug brand used, the needle type, the float/pilot jet combo, the float height, airbox type (new model or the old square model), track type (with long, short or medium straights), oil mix ratio and venturi type (12.5 or 8.5).\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures."

Those predictions and data are designed and prepared by European Sports Analyzers and Computer Engineers.\n* In our applications, you can find the whole leagues’ matches and league table in the same screen and you can easily compare them. \n\n What is the biggest advantages of our application?\n* All data is ready and in one sheet; easy to compare everything. \n* You can compare league by league.\n* You can compare match by match.\n* You can compare according to total match statistics.\n* You can compare according to home/away statistics.\n \n What is our aim?\n* Our aim is not to bilk you by showing you incorrect data.\n* Our aim is not to serve expansive predictions.\n* Our aim is to serve you useful data and the choice up to you. We are leaving the choice to you.\n* Of course, in the future there will be some other fake applications, but do not forget us, we are the first to do this and we will always be best for you.\n \n What is the reason to choose us for you?\n* We are cheaper than others. If you look or search in the internet, you will see that other applications are much more expensive than us.\n* Others show only the matches which they liked. But we are giving all matches to you.\n* Others show only some statistics but we show all statistics to you.\n* Others sends the predictions by email 12-24 hours ago, but you can see all predictions online in our applications.\n\n Which data you will see in our application?\n* League Name\n* Home Team\n* Away Team\n* Home Team Score\n* Away Team Score\n* Home Team Odd\n* Away Team Odd\n* Home Team – Total Matches\n* Away Team – Total Matches\n* Home Team – Home Matches\n* Away Team – Away Matches\n* Total Goal Average, for Over/Under prediction.\n* Prediction for result and percentage of prediction.\n\n If you have any idea, question or need, please feel free to contact with us by using this email address : info@north-software.com \n \n Some additional descriptions:\n\n Some people prefer to bet on some leagues and some others prefer to bet on different leagues. For this reason, even if it reduce our success percentage, we wanted to serve you almost every league. You will decide which league or which team you want to bet on.\n\n For “1” and “2” predictions, we suggest you to use only first leagues. For second and third leagues, it is more common to see that strong teams loose the match or the match ends in draw. We do not restrict those kind of situations in our application because we want to serve you every single match.\n\n For “Over” and “Under” predictions, we suggest you to prepare one table to determine which league is suitable for “Over” or “Under” betting. For example: Greece first league, Greece second league, Portugal second league, Spain second league are not suitable for “Over” predictions. Do not bet on.\n\n We tried to explain how you are going to use this application, we hope that we succeeded. If you are good at logic and mathematics, than you will use this application more effective and successful. You will use this application more effective day by day. You will even create black list for teams and leagues by time pasing.\n\n Good luck !"

An example target might be 'IAG div 2 male age 12-13' which would contain the target times for all events for Irish Age Group, division 2, male ages 12-13. The required target for a swimmer would then be selected from a list in the 'Personal Best Times' view. For each event in the list, the relevant time would be shown from the target, along with the difference between the PB time and the required time for that event.\n\nList items (from the 'Swimmers', 'Targets' and associated times) can be re-ordered and deleted using the 'edit' button - to delete a swimmer or time, click the red icon to the left of the item, to drag a swimmer or time to another location in the list use the 'drag' bar to the right of the item.\n\nIndividual times can be modified by selecting the required time from the list (without needing to select the 'Edit' button)."

It doesn’t require any connection to your car. Results are provided as detailed reports featuring interactive charts.\n\nHow does PerfExpert dyno works ? It's simple :\n1. Create your car profile => Describe your car to PerfExpert by providing information such as curb weight, tire sizes or engine displacement. If you don't know how to find your car's specifications, we help you to do so.\n2. Mount your phone in your car => No need to connect your phone to your car. With your phone firmly mounted inside your car, PerfExpert can rely on its internal sensors to measure the real acceleration of your car.\n3. Accelerate through the entire engine rev range => On a flat, straight and horizontal road, perform an acceleration from low rev to the maximum rev, keeping the same gear : that's it!\n\nIMPORTANT : dyno test is not compatible with automatic gearboxes that doesn't have a manual mode.\n\nWith such a tool, you can check the efficiency of your various tunings, ECU mapping, chiptuning, and even your chassis settings.\n\nUsing the specification of the tested car and your device’s accelerometer, the application runs our algorithms and dynamic power loss calculations to provide the performances of your car with high accuracy.\n\nSkeptical? Here is a selection of comparison tests between “PerfExpert - Car Onboard Dyno” and real chassis dynos, performed by some of our users : http://bit.ly/perfexpert_vs_chassis_dyno\n\nFor further information, you can find our FAQ at https://www.perfexpert-app.com/faq\n\nHere are sample dyno and timed run reports created using the application :\nhttps://network.perfexpert-app.com/results/featured\n\nJoin now the growing PerfExpert community:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PerfExpert\n- Support : https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfexpert/\n\nFeatures:\n- Dyno test : measure the power and torque of your engine with advanced loss calculation model. Detection of the engine rev limiter. Detailed reports featuring interactive charts of wheel and engine horsepower and torque / engine speed, just like a regular chassis dynamometer.\n\n- Compute corrected power and torque using the correction norm of your choice (atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature and air humidity are taken into account). Available standards: DIN (Europe), SAE (America), JIS (Japan), CEE (Europe) and ISO (International).\n\n- Timed Run test to measure your 0-60mph, 0-60ft, 0-1/8mi, 0-1/4mi, 0-100km/h, 0-20m, 0-200m, 0-400m,  and much more.\n\n- Use of your phone accelerometer at its maximum frequency and advanced signal processing for smoothed curves.\n\n- Custom choice of units from a large choice: Hp, Ch, Cv, Kw, Nm, Ft.Lb, mKg, Mph, Km/h, m, ft, G, m/s², psi, inHg, mBar, °C, °F\n\n- Export reports in Tab Separated Value format and PNG"

      "label": "Featured in the TOP 10 SPORTS apps in USA \nFirst real video delay - continuously showing what just happened for quick visual feedback\nUsed by sport coaches, PE teachers, professional athletes and dancers … or if you just want to see how you look on the dance floor :)\n\n\nATTENTION:\n\n+ EDUCATIONAL DISCOUNT\nApp is available with a volume discount for educational institutions\n\n+ DEVICE SAFETY\nThis applications is specially designed not to use your flash disk drive for delaying the video as other apps. Prolonged writing to a flash drive shortness its life span.\n\n+ PRIVACY\nThe app does not in any way collect or send private data or require login. The app is self contained working on your device without any need to contact other services or use internet connection.\n\n\n\nWHAT CRITICS SAY (WITH VIDEO):\n\n[Professional physical education teacher Jarrod Robinson]\n\n“Over the years, I’ve spoken to thousands of PhysEd teachers about the app BaM Video Delay. It’s a complete game-changer that takes what used to be possible with expensive and complicated systems and makes it a reality for everyone”\n\nhttps://thepegeek.com/2016/03/raising-bar-bam-video-delay/\n\n\n[australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org]\n\n“The app has great potential to be used on a regular basis in physical education classes as a formative assessment tool.”\n\nhttp://australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org/2015/11/11/formative-assessment-using-bam-video-delay-app-in-pe/\n\n\n\nUSER REVIEWS:\n\nBy Kbone2000\n5/5 Great app!\nEvery coach needs this app. Immediate feedback for players and a great way for self analysis.\n\nBy James McDermott\n5/5 Great app!\nWorks for what I need, nice that you can have a delay rather than asking someone to record each time.\n\nBy awholelottatry\n5/5 A great technical training tool for sport and fitness\nThis is exactly what I was looking for! Needed it to perfect technique in Crossfit Olympic lifting. Every technical sport could use this valuable tool.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nEver wanted to learn a new move? \nBe it for professional dancing, gymnastics, golf, basketball, tennis, martial arts, breakdance, strike a pose or other use.\n\nA mirror is nice but it's hard to move and look the same time, sometimes even impossible when not facing forward. \n\nA video camera is OK but it is a hassle with all the start, stop, rewind, positioning and other.\n \nSo in the end you don't use either, give up on learning something new and move on with your life.\n\n\n\"Bust a Move Video Delay\" solves these problems.\nIt gives you an easy to use tool with quick feedback. You see what you just did, so you can correct it, try again, look again, correct ... and so on.\n\nAlso, after the initial setup, no interaction is needed so you can focus on training without any distractions.  \n\n\n\nSO WHAT DOES A “VIDEO DELAY” DO ?\n\nIt continuously shows you what just happened seconds ago. There is no alternating record or play phase, just continuous playback but with a given delay. This way you get fast and easy accessible video feedback. \n\nAlso no tapping, rewinding or other interactions are needed. Once set up it works hands free so you can focus on your moves.\n\nNow there are just two easy steps:\n1. BUST A MOVE\n(do what you want to learn)\n2. LOOK & LEARN\n(see what you just did and what's wrong)\n\nThis way you get instantaneous feedback so you can quickly learn on your mistakes and get better in no time. \n\n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- \"hands free\" continuous playback but with a delay\n- up to Full HD at 30 fps and HD at 60 fps\n- universal app for both iPhone/iPod and iPad\n- delays from 1 second up to 6 minutes\n- uses device memory instead of its flash drive\n- up to 4 independent views so you can see yourself 4 times in a row\n- slow motion and pause to analyse the video\n- export as video\n- AirPlay and HDMI TV cable support\n- auto hiding interface controls\n- \"Live View\" for easy positioning of the camera and setup\n- front to rear camera switch\n- horizontal flip\n- x2 Zoom with panning\n- exposure and focus setting\n- and a manual, just in case"

      "label": "Dive Plan is a digital decompression table and log book, made using general public information, most compatible with PADI, SSI, SDI, NAUI, NAVI diving tables, and it is comparable with most of the other current diving organizations and their dive tables. Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

If the answers to these questions are Yes and Lots then this App is for you.  Just input what scores have been made and this App will tell you how much was scored.  To input the scores just state whether is was a Treble or a Double and the value or just the value.  As you input the dart scores the total score is shown.  So, to enter Treble 17, Double 9 and Treble 13 takes just 6 button presses with this App - that's less than it takes to use a normal calculator.\n\nThe green buttons are all the values that can be scored - the numbers 1 to 20, 25 and 50.  At the bottom is a large Red button 'Miss' this is used when you have missed the board.\n\nAt the top is an orange button called 'Treble' - press this when a treble has been scored just before the value of the treble.  So, if you score Treble 7 then press Treble and then press 7.  \n\nAlso at the top is a blue button called 'Double' - press this when a double has been scored and then press the value of the double.\n\nFinally, there is a small red button at the top called 'Undo' - press this when you have made a mistake and the last button press will be removed.\n\nAt the top, to the left before the equals sign, the various dart scores will be shown.  So, you may see T20 + T20 + T20 and this means that you have scored Treble 20 with each dart.  On the other side of the equals sign is the score, in this case it will be 180.\n\nNote: You need to press 'Miss' for any dart that does not score.  The App cycles around to start a new set of three darts when it has three scores and misses counts as a dart/score."

This path must be repeated for six times without any break, and get  the split times every time the athlete passes on the first cone.\n\nThis application will track all the split time and at the end will be calculated two parameters that determine the outcome of the test. More these values are low and better will be the athlete's performance.\n\nBasically the final result is given by a mathematical formula that processes the delta between the averages of the last two split times and the first two split times  and thereby the athlete's ability to maintain its maximum speed for a certain period of time.\n\nThe second value obtained on completion of the test, is the first result considering also the total time of the test.\n\nThe 'YO YO Endurance Test' can be used to determine the level of athletic in all sports (football, running, basketball, volleyball, cycling, tennis etc.)\nAt the end of the test you can get for each athlete the final result (eg. \"Above average\" or \"Poor\") and the Vo2Max estimate\n\nYou can manage more Athletes and save personal data and notes.\nYou can analyze test results.\nAutomatic Sync between devices thanks to iCloud\nInfo section where you can better understand how prepare the test and you can visit linked website and video where get more info about YO-YO Endurance Test\n\nIf you find this application useful, please give a positive review in the AppStore, so we can further improve and develop new options.\n\nFor any further information, please send an email to:\nsupport@bitandweb.com\n\nThanks"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

You add the buttons that you need and aren’t bound by someone else’s predefined ideas of what is important to your team.\n\nFrequency statistics are displayed and data can be exported for number crunching. The time and duration of each note is recorded, allowing events to be imported into video analysis software from where valuable video coaching resources can be created.\n\nEasyTag-Note works as a standalone app but is also designed to integrate with Dartfish software. Use its Quick Import function to match tagged events to the corresponding moment on video. Now you can use Dartfish for editing, analysis and video presentations to your team.\n\nEasyTag-Note Features:\n• Create custom panels or easily modify the provided templates\n• Make your panel unique – you decide what’s important.\n• Time stamping of fixed or open duration periods of activity\n• Pre-roll setting allows you to assess an event before deciding to tag it \n• Mark favourite events for later review.\n• Export data (CSV file) via email\n• Statistics display and bar graph representation of data\n• Dartfish Quick Import easily integrates your notational analysis with video. \n\nDartfish EasyTag-Note is an iOS 10 compatible update of our Easytag app and the little brother of Dartfish Note. No myDartfish subscription is required but it has more limited functionality than both these apps. \n\nAbout us: Dartfish has a pedigree in video analysis going back to 1998. We are proud to serve teams, federations and gold medallists from all round the world."

You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

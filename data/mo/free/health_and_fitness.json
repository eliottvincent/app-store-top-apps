      "label": "The LeaveHomeSafe mobile app provides citizens a convenient digital tool to record their visit history themselves on their mobile phones by scanning QR codes displayed in venues for the use in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  Visit records will be automatically removed after 31 days.\n\nIf there is confirmed case in a venue located in Hong Kong, the mobile app will notify those users who have visited the same venue at the same time with the infected person(s), thus increasing vigilance and self-protection awareness of citizens as well as enhancing public confidence in visiting different venues.\n\nUpon confirmation by Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, app users who are confirmed positive or preliminary positive of COVID-19 infection can share their visit history with the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health to help trace the relevant contacts.\n\nThe mobile app allows the app users to store their Vaccine Pass records (e.g. COVID-19 vaccination records, vaccination medical exemption certificate and recovery record, provisional vaccine pass) and testing record. The mobile app automatic displays the app users selected Vaccine Pass QR code after scanning a venue QR code to facilitate the compliance with the “Vaccine Pass” measure. The Vaccine Pass QR code stored in the mobile app will be changed to red color if it is belonged to a COVID-19 infected person, and to amber code if it is belonged to a person under medical surveillance according to Department of Health’s records for the purpose of fighting the pandemic.\n\nThe mobile app also provides a Testing Registration Code function to enable app users to voluntarily store their personal information in advance. This function aims to reduce the time spent on queuing on-site and registration at testing points through a simplified registration process for app users to conduct COVID-19 nucleic acid testing if needed.\n\nThe LeaveHomeSafe mobile app is developed under the supervision by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/privacy \nPersonal Information Collection Statement: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/personal-information-collection-statement"

      "label": "Unlock the power of intermittent fasting to reach your goal weight and get healthy. No diet and no yo-yo effect. Improve your metabolic health  and feel full of energy.\n\nWhat is intermittent fasting?\nIntermittent fasting is one of the most popular health and fitness trends. Instead of a diet, it's an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating. It doesn't specify which foods you should eat or avoid, but when you should eat.\nToday, we eat 3–4 (or more) meals per day, and never feel hungry. This requires our organs to work hard all the time, and never take a break from digesting. Our eating habits may result in obesity and health problems, such as diabetes.\nWhen fasting, your body will detoxify, burn fat and regenerate. After a few weeks, you'll feel healthier and more active. \n\nGradual fasting plans, suitable for all! \nCreate your own fasting plan 13-11, 15-9, 16-10, 16-8, 18-6, 20-4, 23-1, 24, 36, 48, Custom\n5+2 Weekly Plan : During the week, eat normally for 5 days, and choose another 2 days for a little control.Women take 500Kcal and men take 600Kcal on fasting days. You can choose to take it all at once, but a better choice is to divide 600Kcal into two meals, 250Kcal for breakfast and 350Kcal for dinner. The food should preferably be some food with high protein content but low glycemic index (GI). It is not recommended to completely eliminate carbohydrates. When eating, chew slowly and savor well. The fasting days need to be separated, such as Monday and Thursday. This light fasting plan is healthy, effective and easy to implement, allowing you to lose weight easily while enjoying the other benefits of fasting. It can be performed long-term, gradually turning it into a healthy lifestyle.\n16-8 is the most popular fasting plan for weight loss. With 16 hours fasting period, your body will gradually get used to fasting. \n \nBody Status Tracker : \nBlood Sugar Rises \nBlood Sugar Falls \nGlycogen Reserve Drops \nKetosis State \n\nMore Features :  \n- Track your weight changes \n- BMI(kg/m²) \n- Water tracker \n- Drink water reminder \n- On 'Record' Page, you can click 'Start' in the 'Daily Steps' card to read step count data from Apple Health\n\nPrivacy Policy : https://wowfitness.github.io/Privacy-Policy/ \nTerms of Use : https://wowfitness.github.io/Terms-of-Use/"

      "label": "You don’t need any special medical equipment to get your pulse and to keep track of your health state, just your phone camera! Most accurate, fast and easy to use heart rate app.\n \nAPPLIED METHOD:\n\nOur app is based on photoplethysmography (PPG), non-invasive optical technique. Each heart beat transmits the amount of blood to the tissues in your fingers, while the blood absorbs your camera’s light, it illuminates the skin and captures microvascular blood volume changes such as ebb and flow. That allows you to measure the pulse easily, accurately and efficiently.\n \nHOW TO USE:\n\nCover the camera lens and flashlight with your fingertip completely. Do not press too intensively in order to avoid reducing blood flow. Hold your phone steady and keep still. Make sure your fingers are not cold. Press the button and get your results.\n \nTRACK YOUR MEASUREMENTS:\n\nGet visual display of the data at the given period of time. Personal dashboard with your measurement history.\n \nHEALTH KIT INTEGRATION:\n\nSupport for sharing heart rate results with Apple Health App.\n \nREMINDER:\n\nReceive notifications in order to have your finger on the pulse. Staying healthy and fit is a systematic process.\n \nIMPROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE:\nTrack your workout effectiveness to get in shape, improve your endurance and general wellness.\n \nNEVER MISS A BEAT!\n \nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n \nYearly subscription with 3-day free trial period will give you full access to \n* Unlimited measurements per day, \n* Monthly statistics,\n* Health insights, \n* No ads.\n \nDisclaimer: App measurements are just recommendations and can’t be used for diagnostics or medical purpose. Always seek a doctor's advice before making any medical decisions.\n\nPlease note that the app doesn't measure blood pressure, oxygen levels and body temperature, you can only record and keep measurement indexs! You need a thermometer, a tonometer and a pulse oximeter to measure values. Save your measurements in \"Heart Rate\".\n \nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\n \nSubscriptions may be managed by you and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to iTunes Account Settings. For more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Unused portion of a free-trial period will be forfeited when a user decides to subscribe.\n \nTerms: http://codabrasoft.com/Terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: http://codabrasoft.com/Privacy.html"

      "label": "Monitor your health regularly with CarePlix!\n\nMETHOD:\n\nThe underlying technology is photoplethysmography (PPG), a non-invasive optical technique. When the heart beat, it transmits blood to the tissues in the finger. The blood absorbs the camera’s light and helps us to measure the pulse.\n\n\nHOW TO USE:\n\nStart a scan. Cover the camera and flash till the signal strength is good. Once the signal strength is good, the scan will start automatically, all you need to do is to stay steady and wait for 30-40secs till the scan completes.\n\n\nNow you have a chance to track your fitness and health every time with just your phone.\nYour resting heart rate gives you a view into your heart's fitness. The fitter you get the lower your heart rate will be.\n\nEnables:\n- Heart rate measurements\n- History\n- Contactless – No sensors, contacts, or cuff to touch. Measurements are taken using the phone camera\n- Private - Your measurement is encrypted when sent to our cloud servers for analysis and your history is stored using the same encryption techniques that are used by banks. Your video images are never saved while performing a measurement.\n- Free – Most importantly, Careplix Vitals is completely free to use!\nWhat is a normal heart rate or heartbeat?\nAccording to American Heart Association (AHA) and the Mayo Clinic, a normal resting heartbeat ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute (BPM). Heart rate can be affected by stress, anxiety, depression, emotions, activity level, fitness level, body composition, and medication use. Knowing heart rate is an important heart-health gauge and cardiovascular metric. Heart rate variability is important in measuring stress on your body\n\nLegal and Regulatory Information\nCareplix Vitals application is clinically validated and registered with The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) is India's national regulatory body for pharmaceuticals and medical devices as a Class B Medical Device.\nCDSCO License number available on request.\nAll data are encrypted, and we are HIPPA compliant.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.careplix.com/policy\nTerms of Use: https://www.careplix.com/terms\n\nDisclaimer:\nApp measurements are just for reference and recommendation purposes and shouldn’t be considered as diagnostic or medical purposes.

      "label": "【什么是训记？】\n\n\n你没看错，这就是一款比较「硬核」的健身 APP。所谓硬核就是不适合大多数人，这大多数指的是那些并没有想要记录自己训练计划的人或者是那些并没有在健身举铁中坚持下来的人。\n\n因此，这款 APP 很遗憾，不是为了满足大部分的需求而做的，所以我也并不考虑。\n\n在训练中记录笔记，精确到每一组的重量和次数，在健身爱好者之中是极为重要的，这一点我就不再扯了，具体的之后会在我的收费部落中讲述。\n\n这款软件的初心是：更好的记录和分析自己的训练内容。\n\n\n【为什么我要做这样一款软件？】\n\n\n举铁的训练质量与重量、次数等因素密切相关，而训练中的王者：训练容量 = 组数*重量*次数，因此方便记录自己训练质量的工具就应运而生。\n\n在上古时代，人们使用的是纸和笔，自从微软发布 Excel 以后，人们开始使用 Excel 来进行记录分析，其实还是有很大的痛点所在：\n\n直至今日，仍然有很多人在坚持使用纸和笔到健身房辅助记录数据，包括现在大部分的教练员都是使用纸和笔，帮助会员记录、分析数据。\n\n纸和笔最大的好处就是，灵活。\n\n但就在目前而言，这个优势其实很小很小，其最大的痛点就是容易丢和数据的零散杂乱。\n\n对于这一点，Excel 做得挺好的，但是 Excel 毕竟只是一款针对记录一切数据的软件，虽然他能够用来记录数据，但终究不是记录健身数据的一款软件。\n\n因此，制作了这款app，希望通过一个极其简单，没有任何奇怪功能的软件来自由的记录我的训练内容。\n\n\n【「训记」和 「其他健身app」 有什么不同？我应该用它吗？】\n\n\n其他健身app 都是非常好的软件，其内容丰富的课程，视频文章，都是已经被业界内认可，更重要的是，其他健身app 很大程度上培养了一大批以前从未想过健身的人去健身，我觉得这是一件非常棒、非常好的事情。\n\n虽然 其他健身app 很简单使用，但 其他健身app 实际上很难满足我们这种健身狂人的一些需求：比如自定义计划和自定义输入，都不够自由。训记 和 其他健身app 最大的不同就是 足够自由，那么「训记」就应运而生了。\n\n这款app适用人群其实还是比较窄的，我总结了几个点，你逐一分析，看看自己是否需要：\n\n1、你明白健身是什么回事，也明白健身和减肥互不为充要条件。\n\n2、你清楚健身中，健身记录是非常重要的，健身记录之后的分析也是同样重要的。\n\n3、你想看某些人的健身计划，具体到每一组做了多少个、多少重量，每周训练几次，每周都什么时候练（这个功能是一定要做的，当然，现在还没有，哈哈）\n\n4、基于自己记录的数据，自动分析、辅助并指导自己训练的图表等功能\n\n\nHealthKit\n\n- Apple Watch 上训练时会将你每次训练时的心率、消耗、训练距离同步到你的 Healthkit 中，方便你在 apple健康 中查看\n\n- 在训记-我的-身体数据中，开启“同步健康数据”即可同步身体体重\n\n有关您的隐私和 HealthKit 数据的重要说明：\n由于你的健康隐私非常重要，因此我们会在训记手表APP一开始时就询问你是否可以授权我们读取并且写入心率、日常消耗、训练距离的数据，同意之后可以让训记 APP 更好的记录您的训练情况。\n\n\n\n作者邮箱：snakegear@163.com\n创始人wx：fz255236"

On a mental level, it eliminates stress and fear, and helps you develop mindfulness and personal effectiveness. And on a spiritual level, it paves the way towards enlightenment...\n\nHere is what you will find on Slowdive:\n\nGUIDED MEDITATIONS\nThese are special audio programs. The combination of music and the narrator’s voice will put you in the correct state for meditation and instruct you on what to do.\n\nSMART NEWSFEED\nSlowdive has learnt to predict your wants and make recommendations of exactly what you need, based on your preferences and habits.\n\nMULTI-FUNCTIONAL TIMER\nA timer is a vital tool for meditation. Set the metronome, the background sounds and music, and do so much more.\n\nCOMMUNAL MEDITATION\nJoin an online meditation practice on Slowdive, with a new session every hour. We’re stronger together, aren’t we?\n\nBREATHING EXERCISES\nMeditation is inextricably linked to breathing.

For example, HabitMinder will remind you to do breathing exercises or a quick meditation session. It can also track your hydration, encourage you to exercise or go to the gym, and much more.\n\nThe app has more than 50 pre-defined positive and healthy habits to track - it will get you started for good.

This will improve your focus and your mood as well as having a positive impact on your physical health.\n\n• Exercise – you need to exercise to stay fit, lose weight, and stay physically and mentally healthy. HabitMinder can't do the exercise for you but it will help you stay on schedule.\n\n• Stretching – stretching is an essential part of being fit and healthy. It can also help you relax so should be part of your daily routine.\n\n• Stand – it will surprise you when you learn just how much of your day you spend sitting down. Your attention will improve, you will feel more energised, and you will improve your physical health by getting into one simple habit – standing up frequently and regularly.\n\n• Squats – your partner will love this habit and so will you. Your muscles will become firmer and more toned, and you will feel stronger. Squats can even help you lose weight.\n\n• Eat healthily – everyone knows the benefits of eating healthily. Getting into a regular and committed healthy eating habit is easier said than done, however. HabitMinder is the solution – it will help keep your healthy eating plans on track.\n\n• Sleep more – sleep is crucial for your physical and mental health and wellbeing. Even 30 minutes more per night will have a positive impact.\n\nDownload today, HabitMinder - your daily habit tracker.\n\n---\n\nOptional auto-renewing yearly Premium Subscription is available (price varies by territory, may include 7 day free trial) located on the Upgrade page.

Benefit from the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method, trusted by hundreds of millions adopters worldwide!\n\nPerfect for establishing a basic eating discipline, Simple is ideal for keeping yourself in good shape during self-isolation, with our educational and motivational content on staying mindful about your eating habits.\n\nPopularized by celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé, intermittent fasting is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans. It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours before the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n\nThe user may manage subscriptions in the iTunes settings. Auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.

With over 20,000 trained, experienced, and accredited therapists covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it.\n \n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 20,000 licensed, accredited, and highly experienced therapists\n• Match with an available therapist who best fits your needs\n• Unlimited private one on one communication with your therapist\n• Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secure messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars\n \nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n \nLICENSED AND TRAINED therapistS & THERAPISTS\nThere are over 20,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n \nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n \nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n \nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n \nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason."

      "label": "Dreaming of a flat belly, lean legs, and toned glutes? Get desired results in 30 days with Gravity Fit: choose workouts for your trouble zones or train your entire body using a ready-made program designed for your needs and parameters.\n\nWe guarantee you will achieve your goals, just like these other users:\n\n”I'd like to thank Gravity Fit for an excellent training program. You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

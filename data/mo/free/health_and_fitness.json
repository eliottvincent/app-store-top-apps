Visit records will be automatically removed after 31 days.\n\nIf there is confirmed case in a venue located in Hong Kong, the mobile app will notify those users who have visited the same venue at the same time with the infected person(s), thus increasing vigilance and self-protection awareness of citizens as well as enhancing public confidence in visiting different venues.\n\nUpon confirmation by Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, app users who are confirmed positive or preliminary positive of COVID-19 infection can share their visit history with the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health to help trace the relevant contacts.\n\nThe mobile app allows the app users to store their Vaccine Pass records (e.g. COVID-19 vaccination records, vaccination medical exemption certificate and recovery record, provisional vaccine pass) and testing record. The mobile app automatic displays the app users selected Vaccine Pass QR code after scanning a venue QR code to facilitate the compliance with the “Vaccine Pass” measure. The Vaccine Pass QR code stored in the mobile app will be changed to red color if it is belonged to a COVID-19 infected person, and to amber code if it is belonged to a person under medical surveillance according to Department of Health’s records for the purpose of fighting the pandemic.\n\nThe mobile app also provides a Testing Registration Code function to enable app users to voluntarily store their personal information in advance. This function aims to reduce the time spent on queuing on-site and registration at testing points through a simplified registration process for app users to conduct COVID-19 nucleic acid testing if needed.\n\nThe LeaveHomeSafe mobile app is developed under the supervision by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/privacy \nPersonal Information Collection Statement: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/personal-information-collection-statement"

The better you understand how well you are sleeping the more you are able to make changes in your routines to benefit your rest.  \n\nMy goal is to provide every Apple Watch owner with a free automatic sleep tracker that is simple and clear to understand.  For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

When the heart beat, it transmits blood to the tissues in the finger. The blood absorbs the camera’s light and helps us to measure the pulse.\n\n\nHOW TO USE:\n\nStart a scan. Cover the camera and flash till the signal strength is good. Once the signal strength is good, the scan will start automatically, all you need to do is to stay steady and wait for 30-40secs till the scan completes.\n\n\nNow you have a chance to track your fitness and health every time with just your phone.\nYour resting heart rate gives you a view into your heart's fitness. The fitter you get the lower your heart rate will be.\n\nEnables:\n- Heart rate measurements\n- History\n- Contactless – No sensors, contacts, or cuff to touch. Measurements are taken using the phone camera\n- Private - Your measurement is encrypted when sent to our cloud servers for analysis and your history is stored using the same encryption techniques that are used by banks. Your video images are never saved while performing a measurement.\n- Free – Most importantly, Careplix Vitals is completely free to use!\nWhat is a normal heart rate or heartbeat?\nAccording to American Heart Association (AHA) and the Mayo Clinic, a normal resting heartbeat ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute (BPM). Heart rate can be affected by stress, anxiety, depression, emotions, activity level, fitness level, body composition, and medication use. Knowing heart rate is an important heart-health gauge and cardiovascular metric. Heart rate variability is important in measuring stress on your body\n\nLegal and Regulatory Information\nCareplix Vitals application is clinically validated and registered with The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) is India's national regulatory body for pharmaceuticals and medical devices as a Class B Medical Device.\nCDSCO License number available on request.\nAll data are encrypted, and we are HIPPA compliant.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.careplix.com/policy\nTerms of Use: https://www.careplix.com/terms\n\nDisclaimer:\nApp measurements are just for reference and recommendation purposes and shouldn’t be considered as diagnostic or medical purposes.

It never repeats, it has top-notch sounds, and it is just plain fun to use.\" - Cult Of Mac.\n‣ \"Not everyone likes a quiet workspace. Some of us prefer to have a little background noise. We've covered many online noise generators in the past, but MyNoise is different...\" - Lifehacker.\n\nmyNoise® is free, and comes with 20 FREE SOUNDS, amongst which: White Noise, Rain Noise, Ocean Noise, Binaural Beats, Spring Walk, Temple Bells, Distant Thunder, Irish Coast, Gregorian Voices, Tibetan Choir, Japanese Garden, Duduk Song, 88 keys, The Pilgrim, Unreal Ocean, Flying Fortress, Cafe Restaurant, Calm Office, Old Mansion, Take It Easy, and Warp Speed, the ultimate white noise for Sci-Fi fans…\n\nThe idea behind a noise machine, is to make use of the noises you like to mask the noises you dislike. The concept is simple, works extremely well, and does not require expensive equipment, such as active noise cancelling headphones.\n\nNoise machines can be used by all audiences in a variety of ways throughout our daily lives; whether you're trying to work, study, relax, or even sleep.\n\nWith its 10 color-coded sliders, myNoise introduces the concept of frequency-shaped noises, focusing on the frequencies one wants to effectively block. This ensures a higher efficiency, and quieter masking levels than any other noise machine available on the market and online.\n\nListening to myNoise noise generators in a quiet environment makes sense too, and is even recommended to enjoy their optimal sound quality! Our noise machines are extraordinary to experience, especially with your favorite set of headphones.\n\nSome of our noises are truly special: our so-called calibrated noise generators cover the entire audible frequency range, from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, over 10 color-coded octaves. Thanks to our unique calibration procedure, each calibrated generator can be made spectrally flat to your ears. As we get older, we all suffer from age-related hearing loss involving the higher tones. During the calibration procedure, we are able to measure your personal hearing levels, and adapt our calibrated noises - such as the rain noise - accordingly. You'll be surprised to hear frequencies you thought were lost forever! \n\nCalibrated noise generators also compensate for your audio equipment and listening environment deficiencies, including the presence of background noise and its nature.\n\nWe regularly add new generators that you can find in the Download tab. Check them out, some of them are free to download. If you are a noise enthusiast, purchasing the \"All You Can Hear\" package guarantees that you will get unlimited access to all generators, including future ones. There are more than 250 generators available for download today, including 40+ calibrated ones. Enjoy!\n\nTerms of use: these sound generators are provided for personal/private use only. myNoise® audio stems are subject to copyright and shall not be used in any other context without permission."

Get desired results in 30 days with Gravity Fit: choose workouts for your trouble zones or train your entire body using a ready-made program designed for your needs and parameters.\n\nWe guarantee you will achieve your goals, just like these other users:\n\n”I'd like to thank Gravity Fit for an excellent training program. You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14.

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

Your involvement in each session can be as brief a 30-second “quick hit of stimulation,” or as long as ten-minute “creative workshop.”\n\nRoger von Oech created this product. His seminars and products have enhanced the creative thinking skills of millions worldwide. He is the author of the creativity classic A Whack on the Side of the Head, A Kick in the Seat of the Pants, and Expect the Unexpected.

      "label": "This is one of the best ID copy apps.\n\nUsed for photocopying of common documents, including common ID cards, passports, driving licenses, business licenses, etc.\n\nThe main functions are as follows:\n\n1. Built-in common templates\n   Including ID card, household registration book, passport, driver's license, driving license, bank card, birth certificate, single page, marriage certificate, real estate certificate, etc.\n   Including common certificates of Hong Kong, the United States, Japan and other countries and regions\n\n2. Document combination\n   You can combine multiple documents on one piece of paper as needed, such as copying ID card, household registration book, and driver’s license on one piece of paper\n\n3. Change the document size parameters arbitrarily\n   In theory, you can make any documents that are not built-in or adjust according to the print size\n\n4. Picture automatic trimming & manual adjustment and rotation\n   In most cases, the border of the document can be automatically identified for subsequent use, and manual fine-tuning is also supported\n\n5. Filter support\n   Support monochrome, black and white, enhanced, original image and other filter modes to meet different needs\n\n6. Text & watermark support\n   Add text or watermark to the certificate to prevent the certificate from being misused\n\n7. Wireless printing support\n   For printers that support AirPrint, you can print directly\n\n8. Save and share\n   Can be saved to a local album, or shared to WeChat, email and other common sharing methods using PNG, PDF and other formats\n\n9. History preservation\n   Automatically save the certificate to history for subsequent use\n\nNow you can freely move, add, and delete ID photos. Now you can combine various IDs such as account book, ID card, driver's license, bank card, etc. on a piece of A4 paper to meet the needs of different scenarios.\n\nSome comments are as follows\n\n\"Add all kinds of certificates to it, it is convenient to find and use, it is very convenient and fast, and it is very practical.\" - Brother 666, who is happy and free\n\n\"The software is good, it's relatively easy to use, save the copy of the certificate, improve the efficiency\"\n\n\"The software is concise and clear, and finally there is a software that can specifically back up my credentials, which is very easy to use.\"\n\n\"This software is exactly what I need, and the software is also very smooth to use. I hope the author will add more functions in the future.\"\n\n\"Finally I found this kind of software that directly turns the ID card in the photo into the A4 printing function. In the future, I don’t need to print the ID card and other documents in the typing company. I hope that the developer can add a graduation certificate, marriage certificate, practice certificate, etc. Credential function.\"\n\n\"It was troublesome to scan when I used it before. It is very convenient to just print it offline\"\n\n\"It’s seems incredible that there are no apps like this, dedicated only scan id’s. I would really love to be more international and not only US and Chinese? Hopefully we will get more updates to this app. Thank you!\"\n\n\"Save pdf export is very clear. Several similar software tried out the most cost-effective\"\n\n\nThis software does not collect any user privacy data or user behavior data, and all data is stored locally. All data only exists with this machine, and the sharing function is the built-in system function of iOS.\n\nAfter version 2.2, the iCloud backup function was added at the request of some users. The technology used was provided by Apple CloudKit. For ID pictures generated before version 2.2, users need to manually open the pictures to be backed up once, and then perform iCloud backup. The picture files backed up to iCloud can be seamlessly viewed and used using the \"File\" that comes with iOS or the Finder (Go->iCloud Driver) that comes with Mac.\n\nIf you have any problems or bugs, please report to life4happy at 126.com (replace at with @), thank you for your support!"

      "label": "Ditch the office scanner!\nJust snap a photo of your document, and get a PDF file you can instantly send to your colleagues, all from your iPhone or iPad.\n\nTACK SHARP SCANS\nThat processor in your phone is quite a little monster. Smart PDF Scanner uses it fully to make the best possible scans. Even full-page articles come out tack-sharp and easy to read.\n\nIt automatically detects the page edges and corrects for perspective. Pick full-color scans, grayscale, or black-and-white for maximum legibility. FlashAssist can take perfect scans even in poor lighting conditions. You can even change the correction and enhancement settings after the fact.\n\nPOWERFUL COLOR-CODED ORGANIZATION\nScanning is just half the problem. You need a good way to keep all your documents organized, and easy to find later. Smart PDF Scanner uses a simple tagging system that is much easier and more powerful than the regular folder system. File documents under custom color-coded categories with just a couple taps. Browse and sort files by category with a couple more.\n\nIt's the way filing should work.\n\nEASY TO SHARE\nExport scans as PDFs or images, and email or print directly from the App. Files can also be shared via AirDrop, or sent to another App.\n\nEasily upload to Dropbox, Google Drive, and other cloud services with the corresponding third party App. Send PDFs and images to services such as Evernote or OneNote to take advantage of their OCR capabilities.\n\nFOR ALL YOUR SCANNING NEEDS\n+ Quickly scan and send contracts and forms\n+ Keep scans of important documents in your pocket, separate form the Photo Library\n+ Scan all your travel receipts for easy expense reports\n+ Keep digital copies of your notes and sketches\n+ Scan articles and send them to iBooks to read on the go\n+ And more!\n\nAPPS BUILT FOR PROFESSIONALS\nSmart PDF Scanner uses the latest technologies packed into your iPhone and iPad, but we've worked hard to make it as easy and fast to use as possible. Intelligent image processing eliminates the need for fiddling with complicated controls. That way, you can focus on getting the job done, and doing what you do best.\n\nTIPS AND TRICKS\nHere are a few tips to get the best scans:\n+ Place your document on a darker surface to improve the edge auto-detection.\n+ You can drag the corners of the blue rectangle to fine tune it after taking a photo.\n+ Make sure there is adequate lighting. Use the flash in low-light conditions.\n+ You can tap on a page to edit its scan settings (including edges) after the fact.\n\nMADE BY DEVELOPERS WHO CARE\nWe are dedicated to handcrafting the best possible Apps for your iPhone and iPad, and we hope you enjoy using Smart PDF Scanner. If you have any additional questions, please drop us a line via our feedback page.\n\nBest regards,\n\n-- The App Makers @ Qrayon."

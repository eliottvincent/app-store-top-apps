      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

      "label": "1+1 helps to teach children how to add numbers from 1 to 10. The app doesn’t use any words, so the app can be used for children in any language. Based on the Leitner-System, means questions will be repeated again and again as long as the child learned the answer. Can also be used for older children to perfect what they have learned.\nThe app is tested by teachers, what you can find below in references.\n\nteachingappz.co.uk:\"I had great fun playing with the app :-) Possible Classroom Uses: 1. Connect the device to a projector and use it to review basic addition skills. 2. Let children explore the app individually. How many levels can they complete successfully? 3. Use the app alongside practical equipment to support children’s counting and addition skills.\"\n\nbestappsforkids.org: \"1+1 is a fantastic math app for our little ones! It is based on a concept of repetition yet our kids will never notice as the colorful presentation and the constant positive reinforcement keeps them going! If they get a wrong answer there is a subtle sound and the problem will be repeated until it is apparent that they know the correct answer. You can reset the app back to new in the info page. This would be a great classroom and preschool app! This app is a great addition to your kid’s toolbox for life!\"\n\napps24h.com: \"1+1 is a great math app to practice math. It is simple and well designed to help kids learn all the required steps to deal with simple math. Fun Educational Apps would highly recommend to kids just starting learning about math.\"\n\nesparklearning.com: \"Your app 1+1 is included in our new curriculum, which is being rolled out to thousands of additional students this fall.\"\n\nkinderappgarten.de: \"1+1 is a useful tool for all parents with school starters or preschoolers who want to prepare for the first class.\"\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\nThe app is split in nine levels. In every level there are six equations, which the child has to solve.\nThe app is based on a modification of the Leitner system:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard\nThat means, the questions are repeated until the child gives the right answer. Thus, the answers will be incorporated into the memory. So it creates a real learning effect.\nIf child did all correct, the level is finished and in case, child got enough scores, next level will be opened. To get the third star, child has to play the level again.\nIn last level there will be asked many equations (around 40) again.\n\nRecommended for ages 5 - 8\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n'The 1+1 program is an adequate introduction in mathematical basic experiences and understanding for pre-school-age children and newcomers in school. \nThe design of the program enables them to do the lessons by their own. Children like the layout with the clear colors and shapes. \nAfter each lesson the program motivates the children by an encouragement. \nAs a headmaster with many years of experience I can give my best recommendations to the 1+1 program.'\n\nLudwig Hanisch, director primary school, Germany\n\n'The 1 + 1 program of the company creasoft is a by methodical / didactic aspects developed learning software for children of the first primary school class. It practices the addition in the numerical range to 10. Psychological aspects of learning were at the iphone/ipad - app considered and also a motivating, age-appropriate layout and intuitive operability.\nIn my view, the app is recommended as a complementary medium for learning and practicing very much.'\n\nJürgen Haller, director high school, specialized in edutainment, Germany\n\n'The very clear tasks of this educational game make fun!\nThey ask and encourage the concentration inconspicuous,\nbecause the joy of solving the tasks is in the foreground.\nThis successful combination leads to successful learning.'\n\nAnne Claßen, teacher primary school, Germany"

      "label": "* Finalist for the BestAppEver Award: Toddler Apps *\n \nThe best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.\n\nNow with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.\n\nFirst Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:\n\n** Animals **\n** Vehicles **\n** Colors **\n** Shapes **\n** Words from around the house **\n\n(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

      "label": "The OFFICIAL ABRSM Aural Trainer contains interactive challenges to help develop your music aural skills (listening skills). Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 1 to 5. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher.\n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n\n• Improve your sense of pulse and metre (feeling the beat).\n\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it or spot differences and mistakes).\n\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n\n• Learn to describe dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Pulse and Metre\n• Echoes\n• Differences\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nTackle each element in stages using the preparation exercises.\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again. The app also features supporting tools including an interval trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

      "label": "NoteWorks is a musical game, designed to teach note recognition and improve sight reading skills. Hungry Munchy is eager to swallow elusive blue notes. Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 6 to 8. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher. \n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it).\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n• Improve your recognition of cadences, chords and modulations. \n• Learn to describe texture, structure, dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Cadences\n• Chords\n• Modulations\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again . The app also features supporting tools including a cadence trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

Thank\nyou” - Chattity\n\nSound Touch is the #1 app for entertaining and engaging young children -- complete with\nanimal sounds and music.\n\nStimulate children's brains and teach them all at the same time.\n\nListen to the sounds that farm animals, pets and other wildlife make in nature by touching\nwhimsical cartoons. Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

Shape the land with your fingertips!\n     * Make a river meander. Make a glacier recede and advance. Create sand dunes, sea stacks, and beaches. Trigger a rockslide!\n     * Discover fossils as you investigate rock formations.\n     * See how plants weather the Earth by making your own garden. \n     * Discover mysteries like frost wedging, stalactites and stalagmites, and hotspots.\n     * Experiment with four different types of volcanoes.\n     * Earth Day ecology bonus interactions about conservation: test clean energy sources, clean up beaches, and preserve forests.\n     * Learn new vocabulary in 40+ languages with interactive labels in close-up scenes.  \n     * Original artwork by Sarah Jacoby.\n     * Intuitive, safe, and kid-friendly design.\n     * Entertaining for kids and adults alike — play together and learn together!\n\nFREE handbook\nOur expert-reviewed handbook is full of facts, interaction tips, and discussion questions to support learning in this app, in the classroom or at home.

Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn’t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone. It features beautiful, fun, interactive animations of over 20 animals, and it’s bound to be a big favorite for kids and animal lovers of all ages.\n\n„NIGHTY NIGHT“ - is the perfect App for a daily go-to-sleep ritual with lovely animals, sweet music and great narration.\n\n„LITTLE FOX MUSIC BOX“ – is a sing-along songbook with more than 100 interactive elements in 3 songs and the little fox music studio where you can record your own songs.\n\nIf you experience any trouble with the App or have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us any time: contact@foxandsheep.com.

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

This award winning program reliably analyzes and diagnoses your baby’s cry, then recommends helpful solutions – all in less than 5 seconds! Is your baby hungry, sleepy, annoyed, stressed or bored? The Cry Translator will tell you. Click “…More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n- Awarded Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n\n-  I love it ! A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

At that time, the treating team is away and you're on call, running all over the hospital.  \n\nMD on Call gives you tips on how to QUICKLY assess and manage (acutely) common problems so you can go on assessing the next patient, or to your room to get some well deserved sleep.  -- it is NOT meant to replace a textbook --\n \n\n\nFEATURES\nMD on call is divided into 5 main sections:\n\n• Issues •  26 frequent on call situations (including management of some specific conditions)\n\nAbdominal Pain*\nAcute Coronary Syndrome*\nAgitation / Violence\nAnaphylaxis\nBleeding\nBradycardia*\nChest Pain\nConstipation\nDeath (Pronouncing)\nDecreased LOC\nDysuria / UTI*\nDyspnea\nFever\nFebrile neutropenia\nHeadache\nHypertension\nHypotension\nInsomnia\nMeningitis\nNausea / Vomiting\nPain\nPalliation\nPneumonia\nSeizure\nTachycardia\nWound Dehiscence\nWound Infection\n\n• Labs •  Common electrolytes abnormalities (including management)\n\nHypo Ca, K, Mg, Na, PO4, glycemia\nHyper Ca, K, Na, glycemia\n\n• ECG •  Normal and abnormal ECG values, now with examples\n\n• Misc •  Suggestions on how to write orders for admission, \"comfort measures only\", \"on call\" notes, OR and procedure notes.  \nTransfusions:  general information and common reactions\nMisc:  CSF values, opioid conversion...\n\n• Lines and Tubes • How to manage common problems, such as a blocked NG tube.\n\n• Search •  Search using acronyms or keywords\n\n\n****************\n\nFeedback is more than welcome :  visit the website for more details\n\n**************** \n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis publication (application) is to be used as a guide only.

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "We are proud to announce a new and exciting reference tool for the osteopathic community. After a lot of work and time, we are so excited to bring the osteopathic student and physician community this osteopathic study and reference app. There is no app out there on the market right now that is as complete and useful as this app. Some apps summarize some of the information, but no other app contains as much information as is in this app.\n\nOsteopathic students can use this app as a reference tool while on rotations, studying for examinations, or while seeing patients.\n\nThis app has been in development since 2011. As a professor at several different medical schools, I saw students struggle over their rotations because they didn’t have a single, concise, and complete tool to reference. They struggled to remember all of the components of the osteopathic structural exam. They struggled while seeing patients. They struggled with their documentation while doing an osteopathic structural exam. They struggled remembering all of the information for board examinations. This app will change all that.\nAttending physicians and residents can use this app in their office or on the inpatient wards while seeing patients. Physicians can easily refer to this app while writing their notes after seeing a patient.\n\nYou can bookmark important pages, add extra notes. Get to the right entry directly and quickly with the ‘full text search’. The app includes a ‘Classic view’ section which provides important information at one a glance for quick reference.\nEnjoy the app. It’s going to change how you see patients and how you study for exams. It will be the last thing you look at before the dreaded board exam. Have fun and we hope the app helps in every way."

      "label": "Cognitive Bias Modification allows individuals to improve their unconscious decision making processes. The CBM Helper tool has been designed to give people the opportunity to apply this methodology in an easy to use way.\n\nHow To Use The App\n\nWhen a user presses the PLAY button they are presented with a grid of images, their task is to identify and touch the most positive image as quickly as possible. They are then presented with a new set of images and the process repeats until the timer expires.\n\nThe application will allow the user to alter their natural bias and look for more favourable outcomes.\n\nCognitive Bias Modification (CBM) helps patients to make better choices at an unconscious level by increasing their ability to automatically identify a more positive outcome. By continual practice over time the patient becomes more predisposed to finding the good things in life rather than searching out negativity.\n\nJust as when we buy a new car and subsequently see everyone driving them, a persons brain is wired to look for a particular set of stimuli. For example, people who are highly negative and suffering from stress are often looking for the worst case scenario or 'catastrophizing'; these individuals are constantly watching for, and processing possible instigators of disaster.\n\nCBM works by having the patient consciously look for the positives, to find the silver lining in the clouds, in a controlled manner. Over time this help realign the unconscious processes along more positive and productive lines, and eventually will allow the patient to automatically evaluate situations with greater balance.\n\nCognitive Bias Modification has been found to be an effective exercise for individuals suffering from anxiety based disorders such as Stress, Depression and PTSD."

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

      "label": "* The world's number 1 DAF app is used by thousands of people in over one hundred countries. *\n\nDAF Professional has been created to help people who stammer or have a neurological disease such as Parkinson's Disease. It helps people to slow their rate of speech which makes it clearer to others.\n\nDAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.\n\nDAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT). DAF Professional delivers incredibly low latency feedback even when running in the background.\n\nDelayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly. However, until recently, devices have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used.\n\nDAF was originally developed for people who stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010).\n\nIt works by enabling someone to hear his or her own speech in an altered manner. This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups however DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions.\n\nWhen using Bluetooth devices there is an additional delay of 60ms added to the feedback system.\n\nIf you do use a Bluetooth headset you may find you need to turn the bluetooth device on after opening the app to enable it.\n\nDAF Professional works when put in the background or the screen is turned off. Like all apps of this type, it can NOT work during phone calls or with other media apps playing at the same time.\n\nIf you wish to provide any feedback we would be delighted to hear from you. Please email us at support@speechtools.co.\n\nOur lead Speech and Language Therapist is Samantha Brady who qualified as a Speech and Language Therapist in 2001 (PGDip, City University) and gained her Masters in Speech and Language Therapy in 2006 (MSc, City University). She has a wealth of experience of working as a Speech and Language Therapist in a variety of settings and her area of clinical expertise is adult neurology and voice. Samantha is a member of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT), HPC Registered (SL10250) and Lee Silverman Voice Treatment Certified (LSVT).\n\nDAF Professional is fully GDPR compliant and will not collect any of your data without first asking for your consent."

      "label": "Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death and disease in the developed world, and is increasing at an astonishing rate in low and middle income countries due to unhealthy shifts in diet and activity patterns, high rates of smoking, and other risk factors. Although prevention is the best treatment, early intervention and appropriate management of cardiovascular disease leads to far better outcomes, improved quality of life and decreased mortality. \n\nThe Cardiology pocket app by Borm Bruckmeier Publishing aims to provide today’s busy clinicians with an overview of the current approaches to diagnosing and treating heart and cardiovascular disease, in a concise and highly accessible format. This comprehensive guide covers the major heart conditions most often seen in clinical practice, as well as other important cardiovascular topics such as hypertension, diseases of large vessels, and thromboembolic disease. Although some of content is specialized and will be found most useful by cardiologists and other cardiovascular disease specialists, given the large prevalence of cardiovascular disease, many other clinicians from general practitioners and hospitalists, to trainees and medical students will find the information inside extremely useful and practical in day-to-day practice.\n\nThe content of the Cardiology pocket app is presented using a new, innovative user interface (UI) that is elegant, intuitive and simple to use. Features include a unique and highly customizable UI design, gesture-based navigation, bookmarking and annotation support, indexed searching, support for iCloud backups, and numerous interactive components such as medical calculators for important cardiology formulas and scores.\n\nSome of the topics covered in the new Cardiology pocket app include the following:\n• The presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of common conditions such as chest pain, hypertension, dyspnea, syncope, dizziness, arrhythmias, edema, cyanosis and more\n• Information on common diagnostic procedures including ECG, heart auscultation, exercise stress testing, cardiac catheterization, pacemaker testing, and tilt-table testing\n• The use and interpretation of common imaging techniques including chest radiography, echocardiography, angiography, CT, MRI and PET\n• The diagnosis and management of angina, STEMI, unstable angina/NSTEMI and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on the latest practice guidelines from leading organizations such as the ACC/AHA\n• Diagnosis and management of arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, tachycardias and heart blocks\n• Information on the diagnosis and management of heart failure\n• Key guidelines on the diagnosis and management of hypertension including JNC 7 guidelines and recommendations\n• Additional topics such as inflammatory heart and vascular diseases, cardiomyopathies, diabetic heart disease, diseases of the large vessels (eg, aortic aneurysms and dissections, PAD, carotid and renal artery stenosis)\n• The prevention, diagnosis and management of thromboembolic disease including DVT, pulmonary embolism, stroke, HIT, and thromboembolism in Afib and valvular disease\n• Guidelines for preoperative cardiac evaluation prior to non-cardiac surgery\n• Drug administration information for drug classes commonly used in cardiology including vasoactive agents, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, renin inhibitors, CCBs, diuretics, antiarrhythmics, nitrates, antilipidemics, and more\n• The normal values and interpretation of common laboratory values used in cardiology  and cardiovascular medicine\n• Common abbreviations and other useful resources"

Hold it at least 5cm away from the object you want to enlarge and allow the camera to focus on it first (image is brought into focus). Then slowly move the slide switch to enlarge. If the camera does not focus properly, please increase the distance to the object and make a control for the automatic focus (focus not locked) and lighting conditions. Click once for full screen view and then once more for normal. In the full screen view, you can even zoom by spreading the image with your fingers. Clicking the red button will create a snapshot of the zoomed image. It is then saved to your photo album.\nTip: No fast movements!"

      "label": "SCOLIOTRACK IS A SAFE AND INNOVATIVE WAY TO TRACK ONE'S SCOLIOSIS CONDITION\n◆ Invited to Wall Street Journal 2011 Asia Innovative Awards \n◆ Researched and clinically proven to work! \n◆ Scoliometers usually cost $150-$300. \n◆ Easy and simple to use, no medical knowledge or training needed! \n\nThe device allows the user to track the progress of the abnormal spinal curves that occur in scoliosis. With the touch of an iPhone the user is easily able to track their month to month progression. This easy-to-use program is suitable for scoliosis sufferers of all ages. Its high degree of accuracy makes this application suitable for professional such as Doctors, Chiropractors or Physiotherapist and simple enough for personal use at home.\n\nThe device proves much safer than x-ray technology and can be used in between doctor’s visits to track one’s individual condition.\n\n“With ScolioTrack, the patient can track the curvature in the spine from month to month by using the iPhone accelerometer, just as a doctor would with a scoliometer,” said Dr. Lau. “A scoliometer is a device that measures objectively the severity of a scoliosis. And so it is with ScolioTrack.”\n\nThe technology tracks the patient’s Angle of Trunk Rotation (ATR), which is a key measurement in screening and planning for the Health In Your Hands approach to scoliosis treatment. ScolioTrack also tracks a person’s height, weight and photo record of a persons back, both beneficial for growing teenagers or health-conscious adults with scoliosis. \n\nScolioTrack saves all the information in one convenient location and provides touch of the finger retrieval for future checkups.  An easy-to-read display shows data output in graph format for ease of tracking changes over time and the new technology is capable of saving and tracking the data of multiple users. With ScolioTrack’s access to the latest breaking news regarding the condition, and its user-friendly support guides, patients can gain an effortless handle on their disorder.\n \nFEATURES OF PROGRAM: \n• Simple, attractive, elegant interface.\n• Safer and more affordable than x-rays.\n• Can be used with multiple users and saves their data conveniently on the iPhone for future reference.\n• Tracks and saves a person’s Scoliosis Angle (ATR), a key measurement in screening for and planning treatment of scoliosis.\n• Tracks a person’s height and weight, ideal for growing teenagers with scoliosis or adults who are health conscious.\n• Check your results and Scoliosis changes in beautiful history graph.\n• Camera function takes a photo of the person’s back to notice any changes to the back visually such as rib humps, hip protrusion, body alignment or spinal deviation and compare it easily with previous photo records.\n• Displays the latest news feed on scoliosis to keep users informed and up-to-date.\n• Comprehensive database of frequently asked questions about scoliosis.\n• Full help and easy to follow guides so anyone can track their scoliosis in the comfort of their own home.\n\n-----------------------------------\nABOUT DR KEVIN LAU\nDr. Kevin Lau's ScolioTrack is one element of his comprehensive \"Health In Your Hands\" series for a natural, non-surgical, highly effective and proven method for reversing scoliosis. The other elements include his best selling books \"Your Plan for Natural Scoliosis Correction and Prevention\" and \"An Essential Guide for Scoliosis and a Healthy Pregnancy\" which has been translated to 9 languages and an exercise DVD for scoliosis, \"Scoliosis Exercises for Prevention and Correction\". He is a recipient of the \"Best Health-care Provider Award\" by the Straits Time and featured on TV prime time news."

The topics include 167 bones and landmarks, 138 muscles, and 111 organ images.  Turn on the timer option for an extra challenge!\n  Try this unique anatomy quiz game and you'll be happy you did!\n\nA quick anatomy lesson: this app features ALL the bones and many landmarks, but in the bone section, there are only 53 bones listed.... aren't there 206 bones in the body?  Most of the bones are bilateral... one on each side, so we don't quiz the right femur and left femur, this cuts the list down almost in half. Many bones are repeat... 12 ribs on each side, 10 distal phalanges, 10 proximal phalanges... When we take out all these repetitive bones, we are left with about 53 unique bones.... so please know that this app has been designed by experienced intelligent anatomists!"

      "label": "TRINFINITY8:  Energy On-The-Go\n\nTrinfinity8 is designed to assist the user in attaining states of self-balance both physically, emotionally, and sexually using natural algorithms.\n\nTrinfinity8 ™ Energy On-The-Go is a quantum-based technology that streams mathematical algorithms to the user via their iPhone earbuds and phone’s faceplate.  Everything that exists has a mathematical signature, even our DNA.  Trinfinity8 incorporates the most sophisticated technology that sends billions of bits of information to the body to help effect positive vibrational and consciousness change that is in alignment with nature.  (Ear buds must be worn to experience the full benefit of the algorithms delivered sub-audibly with the music.)\n\nTrinfinity8™ Energy On-The-Go uses uniquely designed geometric fractal images to amplify the algorithms.  Quantum physicists are discovering that enlightenment is the charge you attract when your thought patterns get fractal.  A fractal is a geometric shape that can be split into billions of parts, each of which contains an exact copy of the whole.  The Science of Fractal allows phase conjugation and a unified field for waves of people.  Holy men call this ONENESS.\n\nFeatures 4 basic programs:\n\nBalance Energy:  Helps cleanse and balance the body’s electrical meridians for optimum energy availability and use.\n\nI Feel Good:  Helps increase endorphins and opening one’s heart to love, forgiveness, happiness, joy, positive change and good fortune.\n\nLibido Boost – Male:  Helps increase male desire, arousal, stamina, energy, erotic activation and loving regulation with one’s partner.  Enhances overall life-force.\n\nLibido Boost – Female:  Helps increase female desire, arousal, stamina, energy, erotic activation and loving regulation with one’s partner.  Enhances overall life-force.\n\nDIRECTIONS:  The algorithms are delivered through earphones sub-audibly with the music.  EAR BUDS MUST BE WORN to experience full benefit.  Place finger on screen to start program.  Release finger to stop.  A 3-minute program is recommended.  It is not advised to do more than 6 minutes on any program, as some users may be sensitive to subtle energy effects and feel light-headed.  Short daily use is recommended.\n\nNOTE:  Trinfinity8: Energy On-The-Go does not contain any subliminal messages or binaural beats.  This application contains pure information algorithms.\n\n**********************\n\n \n\nLearn more at:  www.trinfinity8.com"

Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

Share them by email, text, or social media. You can even print them through a connected printer!\r\nAdministrating the event is also simple. The list of ticket holders can be sorted alphabetically or by ticket number. Attendee’s contact information can be entered in the app to allow for easy ticket distribution. It also makes it easy for you to communicate with ticket holders in the future as needed.\r\n\r\nWith Event Ticket Hero Premium, you can use Dropbox to sync events and ticket lists between devices. This way, you can use a different device to scan tickets at the door than you used to create the tickets!\r\n\r\nDuring the event, tickets can be scanned for entrance and exit. Visual scanning feedback and optional audio feedback makes it easy to distinguish between valid and invalid entries. \r\nAll ticket scanning history is stored on the device scanning tickets. To ensure a ticket is only used once for entry, it is important that a single device is used to scan tickets at the door.\r\n\r\nThis also means that no internet access is required at the event! Even if your concert is in a basement or your private party is at a remote setting off the grid, you can be an Event Ticket Hero!"

Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

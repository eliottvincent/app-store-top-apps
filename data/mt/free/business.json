During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you.

      "label": "Shopping is always a fun experience. However, customer satisfaction and trust are essential ingredients for successful long-term customer-supplier relationships. Usually, customer satisfaction originates from a user’s comparison of post-purchase and post-usage evaluation of a product with the expectations held prior to purchase. Sometimes this practice may lead to fall into the counterfeit market trap. Today, unauthorised distributors, retailers and online shops, which may sell fake merchandise without scruples, fool more and more users. Validactor deals with critical issues by providing a powerful product authentication APP that helps users to check for original items even before purchasing.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nThe validation process is a very easy one-step task; it works with each kind of product that has been authenticated through the Validactor QR Codes by its manufacturer.\nYou have just to scan the QR Code on the product label and you’ll immediately get confirmation on the product authenticity in addition to other information, such as brand details, manufacturing date, expiry date and current market status.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nValidactor is unique in providing totally integrated and customisable solutions that enable manufacturers to authenticate and safely protect their products. Either you are a brand enthusiastic or a natural products buyer, you don't need to scratch label, scan bar code or manually input the PIN code to perform product authentication.

Validactor APP digital platform offers multi-dimensional features including:\n\n•\tDetailed product information\n•\tExtensive product flagging\n•\tProduct rating display\n•\tWidespread social sharing\n\nBy using the Validactor APP you’ll improve your purchasing experience other than contribute to enforce the following activities: \n\n•\tGet full control on distribution channels\n•\tPrevent brand theft\n•\tAvoid counterfeits in supply chain\n•\tPrevent product losses\n•\tRetrieve lost market share\n•\tEnhance customer loyalty with referral and reward programs"

For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

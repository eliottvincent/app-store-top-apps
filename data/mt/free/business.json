      "label": "Whether you’re working with teammates on a project or planning a weekend activity with loved ones, Microsoft Teams helps bring people together so that they can get things done. It’s the only app that has chats, meetings, files, tasks, and calendars in one place—so you can easily connect with people and bring plans to life. Get family and friends together to manage tasks at home or plan a surprise birthday party. Work with teammates via secure meetings, document collaboration, and built-in cloud storage. You can do it all in Microsoft Teams. \n\nEasily connect with anyone: \n• Meet securely with teammates, family, and friends. Set up a video meeting within seconds and invite anyone by sharing a link or calendar invite. \n• Chat 1-1 or in group chats with friends or colleagues. @mention people in chats to get their attention. \n• Dedicated channels help create a focused workspace for important projects. \n• Video call anyone directly in Teams or instantly convert a group chat to video call. \n• GIFs, emojis, and message animations make it easier to express yourself when words aren’t enough. \n\nAccomplish plans and projects together: \n• Task lists allow you to stay on top of work projects or plans with family and friends. Assign tasks, set due dates, and cross off completed tasks to keep everyone on the same page. \n• File sharing in chats makes it easier to coordinate on work assignments or personal projects.  \n• Cloud storage makes it easy to access shared documents and files on the go.  \n• Dashboard view neatly organizes all shared content—photos, files, tasks, links—so you don’t have to spend time looking for things*. \n• Screenshare, whiteboard, or breakout in virtual rooms to get most out of your work meetings. \n\nDesigned to give you peace of mind: \n• Securely collaborate with external partners for work assignments while maintaining control over your data. \n• Store important information such as subscription passwords in a digital Safe*. \n• Enterprise-level security and compliance you expect from Microsoft 365**. \n\n*Available when using Microsoft Teams with your personal account.  \n**Commercial features of this app require a paid Microsoft 365 commercial subscription or a trial subscription of Microsoft Teams for work.

Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

It is one of a series of apps designed for ASCII2-compatible, Bluetooth® UHF readers from Technology Solutions (UK) Ltd.\n\nUsing responsive, audible, signal-strength feedback and a dynamic graphical signal meter RFID Tag Finder allows you to rapidly sweep large areas and hone in on just the asset you are looking for. Alternatively, configure Tag Finder to only detect when the asset is very nearby - allowing rooms full of cages, boxes and racks to be rapidly and efficiently searched.Using the built-in, default configurations or a fully, user-specified operation, Tag Finder can be optimized for your asset environment.\n\nRFID Tag Finder can be configured for tags encoded using:\n\n∙ SGTIN-96\n∙ GRAI-96\n∙ ASCII\n∙ Hex\n\nTo make life even easier all the necessary encoding configuration can be achieved by simply scanning an RFID tag in the desired format.\n\nThe target asset identifier can either be entered manually or be scanned from a barcode.\nSGTIN-96 encoded assets can be specified using GS1 standard identifiers such as GTIN-8, GTIN-12 (UPC), GTIN-13, GTIN-14 or simply using the Item Reference number.\nGRAI-96 encoded assets can be targeted using GRAI codes or plain asset types.\n\nWith Hex or ASCII encoding selected a useful, in-built tag scanning screen generates a list of nearby tags, ranked by signal strength to quickly provide a target identifier when demonstrating or familiarising yourself with the operation of the App.\n\n\nTechnology Solutions (UK) Ltd (TSL) specialises in the design, development and manufacture of Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) and other multi-technology mobile device peripherals that are used to track products, assets, data or personnel. RFID devices are typically used in transport logistics, stock inventory control, and collection of personal data and attendance.\n\nRFID Tag Finder uses TSL's sophisticated, parameterised, ASCII protocol which provides developers with a powerful set of commands to carry out complex UHF RFID transponder operations in a simple, easy to grasp way. Using these simple pre-configured ASCII commands, any TSL ASCII2-compatible UHF RFID reader can be rapidly integrated into applications resulting in un-paralleled levels of productivity.\n\nPlease note that to explore the full capabilities of RFID Tag Finder requires the TSL 1128 Bluetooth UHF RFID Reader or other TSL ASCII2-compatible UHF reader."

Share them by email, text, or social media. You can even print them through a connected printer!\r\nAdministrating the event is also simple. The list of ticket holders can be sorted alphabetically or by ticket number. Attendee’s contact information can be entered in the app to allow for easy ticket distribution. It also makes it easy for you to communicate with ticket holders in the future as needed.\r\n\r\nWith Event Ticket Hero Premium, you can use Dropbox to sync events and ticket lists between devices. This way, you can use a different device to scan tickets at the door than you used to create the tickets!\r\n\r\nDuring the event, tickets can be scanned for entrance and exit. Visual scanning feedback and optional audio feedback makes it easy to distinguish between valid and invalid entries. \r\nAll ticket scanning history is stored on the device scanning tickets. To ensure a ticket is only used once for entry, it is important that a single device is used to scan tickets at the door.\r\n\r\nThis also means that no internet access is required at the event! Even if your concert is in a basement or your private party is at a remote setting off the grid, you can be an Event Ticket Hero!"

      "label": "Shopping is always a fun experience. However, customer satisfaction and trust are essential ingredients for successful long-term customer-supplier relationships. Usually, customer satisfaction originates from a user’s comparison of post-purchase and post-usage evaluation of a product with the expectations held prior to purchase.

Today, unauthorised distributors, retailers and online shops, which may sell fake merchandise without scruples, fool more and more users. Validactor deals with critical issues by providing a powerful product authentication APP that helps users to check for original items even before purchasing.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nThe validation process is a very easy one-step task; it works with each kind of product that has been authenticated through the Validactor QR Codes by its manufacturer.\nYou have just to scan the QR Code on the product label and you’ll immediately get confirmation on the product authenticity in addition to other information, such as brand details, manufacturing date, expiry date and current market status.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nValidactor is unique in providing totally integrated and customisable solutions that enable manufacturers to authenticate and safely protect their products. Either you are a brand enthusiastic or a natural products buyer, you don't need to scratch label, scan bar code or manually input the PIN code to perform product authentication. The intuitive Validactor APP interface will ease out your decision-making process by offering you a completely new approach to the purchasing experience. Validactor APP digital platform offers multi-dimensional features including:\n\n•\tDetailed product information\n•\tExtensive product flagging\n•\tProduct rating display\n•\tWidespread social sharing\n\nBy using the Validactor APP you’ll improve your purchasing experience other than contribute to enforce the following activities: \n\n•\tGet full control on distribution channels\n•\tPrevent brand theft\n•\tAvoid counterfeits in supply chain\n•\tPrevent product losses\n•\tRetrieve lost market share\n•\tEnhance customer loyalty with referral and reward programs"

Unfortunately, lots of software makes it worse by over-complicating things. Basecamp’s different.\n\nWhat makes Basecamp special?\n\nIt’s dialed in. For nearly two decades, we’ve continually refined a unique set of tools and methods to fundamentally reduce complexity, and make project management more of a joy and less of a chore. Perfected and pressure-tested by hundreds of thousands of teams on millions of projects, Basecamp’s the gold standard for a simpler, superior version of project management.\n\nBasecamp works because it’s the easiest place for everyone in every role to put the stuff, work on the stuff, discuss the stuff, decide on the stuff, and deliver the stuff that makes up every project. Not on separate platforms scattered in various places, but all intuitively organized in one centralized place where everyone can work together.\n\nBasecamp’s intentionally simple by design. It’s why teams that sometimes leave in search of “more power” end up slamming into the consequences of over-powered software: Complexity. Complexity doesn’t work. Basecamp does. It’s why those that leave end up coming back and sticking with us the second time around. You never know what you had until it’s gone."

Which apps can you use? It depends on what’s been created for you. Here are some examples you might see, or ones you can make yourself using the Power Apps website:\n\n• Campus app: Map your campus with icons for landmarks and facility details.\n• Event registration app: Record attendees as they arrive using barcodes or QR codes.\n• Expenses app: Let employees submit their expenses and upload photos of receipts.\n• Health clinic app: Let patients check in to appointments with just a few taps.\n• NFC reader app: Scan NFC tags on ID cards, equipment, packages, etc.\n• Performance app: Visualize data and get insights with interactive dashboards.\n• Sales app: See opportunities and leads, review comments, and approve for your P&L.\n• Space planning app: Take 3D measurements and manipulate objects in mixed reality.\n• Timesheet app: Collect, consolidate, and analyze shift data from employees.\n\nThis is just a handful of examples; the possibilities are endless. Build and share low-code apps for your work or school at the Power Apps website.\n\nTIPS\n\n• Swipe right to make an app a favorite, swipe left to add a shortcut to the home screen.\n• As an admin, mark an app as Featured, so that it stays pinned to the top of the apps list.\n• Some apps can work offline, and Power Apps will sync your data when you reconnect.\n\nAccessibility: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121429"

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

It also makes it easy for you to communicate with ticket holders in the future as needed.\r\n\r\nWith Event Ticket Hero Premium, you can use Dropbox to sync events and ticket lists between devices. This way, you can use a different device to scan tickets at the door than you used to create the tickets!\r\n\r\nDuring the event, tickets can be scanned for entrance and exit. Visual scanning feedback and optional audio feedback makes it easy to distinguish between valid and invalid entries. \r\nAll ticket scanning history is stored on the device scanning tickets. To ensure a ticket is only used once for entry, it is important that a single device is used to scan tickets at the door.\r\n\r\nThis also means that no internet access is required at the event!

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

      "label": "Want to improve employee engagement and performance? Looking for a way to inform meetings and employee evaluations? \n\n15Five is the leading employee communication platform for managers to gain insights into employee progress, and for employees to receive the feedback they need to succeed.\nThis brief, automated weekly process leads to meaningful conversations about everything from how to improve an employee’s role, to the creation of brilliant product innovations. With our new iOS app, have the most important conversations with your team or manager from anywhere!\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nOnce a week, employees answer several questions about their accomplishments from the previous week and provide other details about their progress. Managers can even pass-up answers to directors and executives, providing top to bottom visibility around triumphs, challenges, and great ideas. \n\nOur new iOS app allows you to enjoy the same great features as the web version: \n\nGoals & Accomplishments - Employees enter their goals for the upcoming week. Next week they check off the goals that they accomplished, while the ones that they missed are automatically marked with an x. Employees can add additional accomplishments at the bottom that were not contemplated the week before. Managers get a sense of progress at a glance. \n\nComments - Employee feedback is a two-way process. Managers can comment on answers directly in the app, spawning important conversations about everything from increasing revenue to improving company wide processes. \n\n@mentions - Responses to questions often involve more than one team member. Just @mention orther stake-holders to loop them in to the conversation and make decisions that much faster. \n\nFlag for follow-up - Don’t let important responses fall through the cracks. With this handy feature, you can come back later to provide an employee with support, realign someone around their goals, or talk through an innovative idea. \n\nThe 15Five app is perfect for remote teams to check-in every week, and for on-the-go managers and executives to know the pulse of their company from anywhere at any time. To use the app, you must already be a customer."

Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly.

Yes, WORK FROM ANYWHERE, WITHOUT ANY GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS #morepowertoYOU\n\n*****\n\nPROBLEM: Awesome tech (and non-tech talent) is found everywhere, but the right opportunities for them aren’t. Most of the jobs in the technology sector are for knowledge workers, meaning they are able to work from anywhere and everywhere, with just a computer and internet connection, and get things done.\n\nHowever, the irony is that, even though the companies are okay with employees working for them from home in the pandemic/corona period, as soon as the travel bans are lifted, they want people to return to the office for “culture”/“productivity” purposes [or even for reasons best known to them].\n\nSOLUTION: As we’re going to be stepping into 2023 soon, we found this practice very absurd, and hence, wanted to challenge the status quo, solve this very pressing problem for the greater good and put power back into the hands of the people [literally by creating this #ILRJ - I Love Remote Jobs app]. #noreturntooffice #ilrj #workfromanywhere #morepowertoYOU \n\nWhy we feel you’ll love using the #ILRJ - I Love Remote Jobs app:\n*******************************************************************\n\n- (FOREVER) FREE app available on Apple App Store\n\n- Very Safe App: Meaning NO INTRUSIVE ACCESS TO YOUR CAMERA, PHOTOS, MEDIA FILES, MICROPHONE, OR CONTACTS #peaceofmind \n\n- Easy & Secure registration thereby eliminating a whole lot of bots and fake sign-ups (meaning LESS COMPETITION FOR YOU) \n\n- Simple & Intuitive Navigation for effortless, PERSONALIZED USER EXPERIENCE \n\n- Job search need not be boring. Hence, we have gamified it and hope job seekers like you will find it very exciting enough and learn new things along the way.\n\n- Data Security - We make sure that all your information is handled with care (kept confidential) and utmost privacy \n\n- Unlock Jobs across 21 DIFFERENT CATEGORIES from COOLEST COMPANIES around the world in a couple of swipes, that are rigorously vetted to be SCAM-FREE, and LOCATION INDEPENDENT, meaning YOU CAN WORK FROM ANYWHERE #LikeABoss\n\nDownload the #ILRJ - I Love Remote Jobs app and experience it for yourself. We wish you luck and all the very best in finding your next awesome remote job! :)\n\nExplainer Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oacwM8t-8rQ\nContact us: https://contactus.iloveremotejobs.com/\nTerms of Services: https://iloveremotejobs.com/demo43/terms-of-service.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://iloveremotejobs.com/demo43/privacy-policy.html"

Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

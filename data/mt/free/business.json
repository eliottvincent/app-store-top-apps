      "label": "As part of the Indigo Attendance module, Indigo Mobile allows your employees to clock in and clock out of their shifts using the one device they’ve always got with them - their mobile. \n\nToday’s workforce is changing and is largely moving towards remote workers and flexible working hours and patterns. Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

The app automatically computes 3D point coordinates from 2D images of an object. Measurement errors smaller than 1mm can be achieved in a best case scenario.\n\nWhat can you do with this app?\n- Measure precise 3D coordinates\n- Measure rounded and skewed walls for custom-made kitchens or wardrobes\n- Measure boats to get 3D data for a custom made tarpaulin\n- Measure interior dimensions of vehicles to create custom made fixtures\n- Measure staircases for stairlift installation\n\nThe Linearis3D Photogrammetry app works with paper targets. This has three advantages:\n- Targets make precise measurements possible\n- Computation times are much quicker using targets\n- Targets almost always work. With target you can measure almost any object regardless of its surface.\n\nFor objects smaller than 1m x 1m x 1m you can achieve an accuracy better than 1mm. Be aware that accuracy depends on the size of the object, the angles from which the points are visible, the number of photographs and the condition of your iPhone. It is up to you to make sure the measurement results match your requirements.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION CONDITIONS\n\nYou can export projects with up to 15 images without a subscription. For larger projects or extra features please choose one the following options.\n\nTypes of subscriptions:\nStandard Package: 1 Month for Euro 9,99 in Germany, prices in other regions may vary due to exchange rates and differing tax regulations\nIt features export of 3D points, max. 30 images\n\nPower Package: 1 Month for Euro 29,99 in Germany, prices in other regions may vary due to exchange rates and differing tax regulations\nIt features improved precision and export as well as unlimited images\n\nStairs Package: 1 Month for Euro 67,99 in Germany, prices in other regions may vary due to exchange rates and differing tax regulations\nIt enables you to automatically measure stairs for stairlifts and export the result as a DXF file\n\nYour iTunes Account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed.\n\nThe subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou can go to your iTunes Account settings to manage your subscription ant turn off auto-renew.\n\nTerms of use:  https://www.linearis3d.de/oiha_sdf978h2/TermsAndConditions.html\nPrivacy statement: https://www.linearis3d.de/oiha_sdf978h2/privacy.html"

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

Whova revolutionizes event networking and significantly improves the ROI of attending events.\n\nYou can also use the Whova conference app to digitize and manage business cards you receive at events. Whova exceeds other business card reader apps like CamCard, CardMunch, ScanBizCards or Scannable etc. by automatically building full profiles using Whova's SmartProfile technology. This allows you to gain deep insights into your contacts' professional backgrounds, work experience, passions, and interests. You can also seamlessly connect with contacts online via LinkedIn and other platforms. Whova's business card scanning feature now supports cards in English, Chinese, and Korean.\n\nWhova is SOC2 Type II and PCI compliant.

We no longer have to wander around wondering if we will bump into the person we really would like to meet. “\n\n- “I could see who attended and easily follow up with the people after this entrepreneur/investor event”\n\n- “I have seen other event apps but neither of them provided such valuable information of the attendees. “\n\n- “This app has been fantastic for networking, announcements, agenda, etc., at this one-week conference!”\n\n- “Another great feature of the Whova app is the ability to share slides and documents electronically.”\n\n- \"Whova is an amazing app for keeping track of your connections and storing them in one easy-to-access place. I love the ability to connect with contacts via LinkedIn and the simplicity of emailing potential members.\"\n\nGet in touch:\n\nTo partner with Whova or simply to stay up-to-date with the latest news, please visit our website and follow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/whovasupport\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback!\nContact us at: support@whova.com\n\nAcknowledgements: Icons by Icons8"

      "label": "Okta Verify is a lightweight app that is used for 2-step verification so you can confirm your identity when you sign in to your Okta account. This gives you an extra layer of security so that you - and only you - can access your applications.\n\nWhen you sign in to Okta, you can use Okta Verify to obtain a temporary 6-digit code or to approve a request notification sent to your device (your organization must enable notifications to use this feature).\n\nOkta values your privacy. Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

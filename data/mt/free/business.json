Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

Visual scanning feedback and optional audio feedback makes it easy to distinguish between valid and invalid entries. \r\nAll ticket scanning history is stored on the device scanning tickets. To ensure a ticket is only used once for entry, it is important that a single device is used to scan tickets at the door.\r\n\r\nThis also means that no internet access is required at the event!

      "label": "Did you lose track of your time again? We can help. With a single tap, track and save your time with Toggl Track — anywhere you go.\n\nOr maybe you don't really want to use the pesky phone keyboard — we get it. That's why you can now use Siri to track your time with Toggl Track, no keyboard is needed.\n\nToggl Track also has you covered across all of your devices. Start tracking your hours in a browser, then stop it later on your phone or on your Apple Watch with our brand new watchOS app. All your tracked time is safely synced between your iPhone, Watch, desktop, and browser (if you want more of a Pomodoro timer experience).\n\nFEATURES:\n• Pomodoro mode\nEnjoy better focus and productivity by trying out the Pomodoro technique with our brand new Pomodoro mode. The idea behind the Pomodoro technique is that you can work more effectively when you work in timed, 25-minute increments (with breaks in between). Our built-in timer automatically tracks your time in 25-minute increments, with notifications, a full screen mode, and countdown timer to really help you stay focused and on task.\n\n• Reports\nDiscover what's taking up your time and get a snapshot of your day or week with Reports. Analyze your Reports in the app or export them to send the data to your clients (or analyze them further on our web app to see where your hours are going).\n\n• Sync\nKeeps your time seamlessly synced, safely saved, and ready to track on your account, on any device.\n\n• Calendar\nConnect your calendar app to Toggl Track to see all of your calendar events and time entries in the app itself (in the same view), receive notifications before the events start, and most importantly, instantly create time entries based on your calendar events!\n\n• Customize your time entries with projects, clients, and tags\nOrganize and add more details to your time entries by adding meta data on projects, clients, and tags. See exactly where your work hours are going and adjust your schedule and routines accordingly.\n\n• Siri\nToggl Track is compatible with Siri! Start a new time entry, stop it, or access your reports — all that with just a few words.\n\n• iOS Widgets\nStart (and stop) tracking from your iPhone Home Screen.\n\n• Apple Sign-in\nYou can now also sign into our Toggl Track app via your Apple ID.\n\n• Suggestions\nThe more you track, the better the data. The app will give you suggested time entries based on your tracking habits and previous time entries.\n\n• Shortcuts\nUse @ and # to quickly add projects and tags to your time entry and get back to work right away!\n\n• Auto-complete\nEasily find your older time entries and start tracking time on them again.\n\n• Manual Mode\nWant more control? Add and edit all of your time manually and make sure that every second of your time is accounted for. This feature is optional and it's accessible from the Settings menu.\n\n-----\n\n- But what if I'm offline?\nNo problem! You can still track your time through the app, and once you're back online, it will sync seamlessly with your account (and the rest of your devices). Your time is not going anywhere.\n\n- Is the app free?\nYes, Toggl Track on iOS is completely free for you to use.\n\n- Can I send you some feedback?\nYou betcha (and we'd love to hear from you)! You can send us feedback directly from the app. Just look for “Submit Feedback” in the Settings menu.\n\nYep, that's Toggl Track — a time tracking app so simple that you'll actually use it and get stuff done! See where your time goes, focus on important tasks, and boost your productivity. Whether you’re in an office or en route to one, stuck on a space mission to Mars, or just want to see how much time you're wasting on projects that aren't bringing you money — track your time anywhere you go."

      "label": "Keeping track of the hours you work has never been easier. Whether you're self-employed, a freelance artist or a private contractor, it's important to keep an accurate record of the time you spend on-the-clock.\n\nUnlike other complicated time clock utilities, Punch Time Clock requires zero setup or configuration to begin logging your time. Simply tap 'Clock in' and get to work. Tell the app when you start and end breaks, then finally clock out when you're finished. Review your Log to see a detailed list of completed shifts, make changes, or add and delete entries. At any time you're able to export the log for your personal records or send to a client or employer.\n\nYou're only as efficient as the tools you use. With intuitive functionality, all the features you need and none you don't, Punch helps you track your hours-worked without getting in the way.\n\nFeatures:\n\n:: FULLY EDITABLE LOGS ::\nCreate a shift from scratch. Adjust the time you clocked in yesterday. Add a break you forgot to log during Saturday's shift. You are in total control of your timesheets.\n\n:: LOG EXPORTING :: *\nSimply select a pay period, year, month or custom date range and Punch will list the matching entries in a nicely formatted table you can then email to yourself, a client, or the boss with a single tap! Attached to the email is a CSV spreadsheet file with the exported data which can be easily imported into your record keeping software of choice.\n\n:: CUSTOM PAY PERIODS ::\nPunch allows you to record your hours worked based on the frequency of your paychecks. Some people get paid weekly with their pay periods ending on Saturday, while others are paid every two weeks on Thursday. You can setup your pay schedule in the Settings screen. You only need to do this once.\n\n:: EARNINGS ESTIMATES :: *\nSet how much you're paid and what percentage you expect to be taxed and Punch automatically calculates your paychecks based on the hours you've worked for each pay period. You can also set optional overtime thresholds (both daily and weekly) that are paid at a different rate after a certain number of hours have been worked.\n\n:: MULTIPLE BREAKS PER SHIFT ::\nTwo lunch breaks, three smoke-breaks, or fifteen \"gotta-check-my-instagram\" breaks; Record all of your [completely justified] off-the-clock time.\n\n:: CUSTOM LABELS :: *\nWhether you work multiple jobs, manage different projects, or simply want to make note of what you accomplished, labeling entries is easy and effective.\n\n:: ENTRY NOTES :: *\nNotes are a great place can keep track of mileage, justify overtime worked, summarize what you accomplished, or just keep personal records regarding your shift.\n\n:: RETROACTIVE CLOCK-INS ::\nForgot to clock in? No problem. It's like the having your own time-machine. (Except, instead of influencing past events to alter the course of human history.. you're clocking in a few minutes earlier.)\n\n:: FUTURE CLOCK-OUTS ::\nIf you know what time you'll be calling it quits, the app will handle the rest. (See: Time Machine, mundane uses of)\n\n:: SMART SHIFT PERSISTENCE ::\nNever lose your progress.  Even if the app is closed or your device is restarted, tracking is uninterrupted and picks up where you left off.\n\n:: DARK MODE :: *\nRegardless of whether you think you're a ninja ... or just want to save your eyes from unnecessary eye-strain in dark rooms. Dark Mode is for you.\n\nPunch Time Clock will always be free to use, forever. All core features needed to track your time are unlocked with zero limitations. If you wish you support our app and its continued improvement, a Pro upgrade is available that will unlock extra features, denoted above with an asterisk (*), and increase your productivity even more. Your support is greatly appreciated!\n\nIf you have a moment and can leave us a short review & rating we would be extremely grateful! Please send us an email if you have any questions or comments. Thank you."

It can read and verify the authenticity of identity documents that have a chip, which includes most passports and many identity cards. Before being able to read the chip, the app first needs to scan the so-called Machine Readable Zone of the identity document since this contains the password needed to get access to the chip.\n\nThis app works client-only, meaning that the personal data from your identity document does not leave your phone."

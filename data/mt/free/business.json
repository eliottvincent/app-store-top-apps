      "label": "Whether you’re working with teammates on a project or planning a weekend activity with loved ones, Microsoft Teams helps bring people together so that they can get things done. It’s the only app that has chats, meetings, files, tasks, and calendars in one place—so you can easily connect with people and bring plans to life. Get family and friends together to manage tasks at home or plan a surprise birthday party. Work with teammates via secure meetings, document collaboration, and built-in cloud storage. You can do it all in Microsoft Teams. \n\nEasily connect with anyone: \n• Meet securely with teammates, family, and friends. Set up a video meeting within seconds and invite anyone by sharing a link or calendar invite. \n• Chat 1-1 or in group chats with friends or colleagues. @mention people in chats to get their attention. \n• Dedicated channels help create a focused workspace for important projects. \n• Video call anyone directly in Teams or instantly convert a group chat to video call. \n• GIFs, emojis, and message animations make it easier to express yourself when words aren’t enough. \n\nAccomplish plans and projects together: \n• Task lists allow you to stay on top of work projects or plans with family and friends. Assign tasks, set due dates, and cross off completed tasks to keep everyone on the same page. \n• File sharing in chats makes it easier to coordinate on work assignments or personal projects.  \n• Cloud storage makes it easy to access shared documents and files on the go.  \n• Dashboard view neatly organizes all shared content—photos, files, tasks, links—so you don’t have to spend time looking for things*. \n• Screenshare, whiteboard, or breakout in virtual rooms to get most out of your work meetings. \n\nDesigned to give you peace of mind: \n• Securely collaborate with external partners for work assignments while maintaining control over your data. \n• Store important information such as subscription passwords in a digital Safe*. \n• Enterprise-level security and compliance you expect from Microsoft 365**. \n\n*Available when using Microsoft Teams with your personal account.  \n**Commercial features of this app require a paid Microsoft 365 commercial subscription or a trial subscription of Microsoft Teams for work.

Your company must also have a subscription to Microsoft Intune. \n\nCompany Portal helps simplify the tasks you need to do for work: \n\n• Enroll your device to access corporate resources, including Office, email, and OneDrive for Business\n• Quickly reset the password to your work account if you should forget it\n• Find apps that will help you with your daily tasks as provided by your company\n• View and manage all your enrolled devices – and wipe them yourself if they get lost or stolen\n• Get help from your IT department with easy-to-find contact information\n\nA note about Intune: every organization has different access requirements, and will use Intune in ways that they determine will best manage their information. Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you.

Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

Simple to set up and simple to use, WaiterOne is a powerful tool for your hospitality business.\n\nWaiterOne is a suite of different apps and services running on Apple’s premium hard- and software. We have :\n\nWaiterOne for iPad\nWaiterOne Remote\nWaiterOne Online Dashboard\nWaiterOne KDS\n\nWaiterOne works stand-alone or as a server. Install it on your iPad and start using it right away. \nYour POS solution starts with this iPad version, heart and brain of the system, regulating all traffic from and to your devices (printers, iPods/iPhones, remote iPads, KDS, cloud). WaiterOne for iPad can, of course, be used for any normal command or data entry, but the real power and speed comes in when you start using your iPhone (or iPod) as an ordering device.\n\nWaiterOne Remote for iPhone and iPod touch is free of charge and will transform your iPhone or iPod touch into a waiter ordering system. \nWaiterOne Remote will be your waiters best friend. It's fast, stylish and hip. People will have a look at it and ask themselves : “is this really an iPod?”.\n\nWaiterOne Remote can also used on an iPad. Put it strategically in your bar or restaurant and serve you client faster. \n\nWaiterOne Online Dashboard is our first app that uses the ‘cloud’. With WaiterOne Dashboard you can consult your sales in real time from everywhere, whether your are next door shopping or on vacation on a tropical island. \n\nWaiterOne KDS, our Kitchen Display System for iPad and iPhone, instruct your chef or bartender what he have to prepare for your clients. Paperless, now also in your kitchen and bar.\n\nYES, it prints\n\nWaiterOne prints perfect on the ticket printers from Epson™, Citizen™, Star Micronics™ and many others ESC/POS compatible brands. Being a receipt printer with your restaurant logo at the bar, or a wifi POS printer in the kitchen. Although, in the beginning, the iPad was not made to be used with any printer at all, we were probably the first to print to POS printers. Should you have or want another ticket printer, it probably will have a Epson™ emulator mode, chances are great that it will print. \n\nWhen you’re shift is finished, at the end of the day, you can print out your hard day's work results on your POS printer or on your AirPrint compatible printer or if you’re connected to the internet, send it all to your email address. You could also take your POS solution with you at home, as it is an iPad, no? Now you can even check your results from a distance as you can use our Dashboard app by using the ‘cloud’.\n\nAnother benefit regarding normal PC hardware for your POS solution is that there are no moving parts in the iPad, no fans that will stop spinning and block your system in the middle of your service. You don’t have to invest in a server or an expensive database server neither. You don’t need high speed internet access, a backup plan or an expensive contract for using the ‘cloud’.\n\nThere is no other system that comes close to the speed, graphics, intuitive use, learning curve and cost of our solution. \n\nIf you don't have an iPad, you don't have WaiterOne, an easy to use, stunning POS solution for your restaurant or bar business."

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

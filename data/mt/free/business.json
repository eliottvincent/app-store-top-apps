Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

      "label": "Shopping is always a fun experience. However, customer satisfaction and trust are essential ingredients for successful long-term customer-supplier relationships. Usually, customer satisfaction originates from a user’s comparison of post-purchase and post-usage evaluation of a product with the expectations held prior to purchase. Sometimes this practice may lead to fall into the counterfeit market trap. Today, unauthorised distributors, retailers and online shops, which may sell fake merchandise without scruples, fool more and more users. Validactor deals with critical issues by providing a powerful product authentication APP that helps users to check for original items even before purchasing.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nThe validation process is a very easy one-step task; it works with each kind of product that has been authenticated through the Validactor QR Codes by its manufacturer.\nYou have just to scan the QR Code on the product label and you’ll immediately get confirmation on the product authenticity in addition to other information, such as brand details, manufacturing date, expiry date and current market status.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nValidactor is unique in providing totally integrated and customisable solutions that enable manufacturers to authenticate and safely protect their products. Either you are a brand enthusiastic or a natural products buyer, you don't need to scratch label, scan bar code or manually input the PIN code to perform product authentication. The intuitive Validactor APP interface will ease out your decision-making process by offering you a completely new approach to the purchasing experience. Validactor APP digital platform offers multi-dimensional features including:\n\n•\tDetailed product information\n•\tExtensive product flagging\n•\tProduct rating display\n•\tWidespread social sharing\n\nBy using the Validactor APP you’ll improve your purchasing experience other than contribute to enforce the following activities: \n\n•\tGet full control on distribution channels\n•\tPrevent brand theft\n•\tAvoid counterfeits in supply chain\n•\tPrevent product losses\n•\tRetrieve lost market share\n•\tEnhance customer loyalty with referral and reward programs"

Whether it’s a concert, or private event, be the Event Ticket Hero!\r\nWe collect no fees from ticket sales. Collect payment by cash or other means available to you, then use Event Ticket Hero to issue the tickets! \r\n\r\nSending tickets electronically to ticketholders has never been easier. Share them by email, text, or social media. You can even print them through a connected printer!\r\nAdministrating the event is also simple. The list of ticket holders can be sorted alphabetically or by ticket number. Attendee’s contact information can be entered in the app to allow for easy ticket distribution. It also makes it easy for you to communicate with ticket holders in the future as needed.\r\n\r\nWith Event Ticket Hero Premium, you can use Dropbox to sync events and ticket lists between devices. This way, you can use a different device to scan tickets at the door than you used to create the tickets!\r\n\r\nDuring the event, tickets can be scanned for entrance and exit. Visual scanning feedback and optional audio feedback makes it easy to distinguish between valid and invalid entries. \r\nAll ticket scanning history is stored on the device scanning tickets. To ensure a ticket is only used once for entry, it is important that a single device is used to scan tickets at the door.\r\n\r\nThis also means that no internet access is required at the event! Even if your concert is in a basement or your private party is at a remote setting off the grid, you can be an Event Ticket Hero!"

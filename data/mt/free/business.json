Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

When using MFA, you will first be prompted to enter your username and password. You will then be asked to either receive a push notification or a enter a verification code also known as Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) as a second factor to login. \nIf you request a push notification, all you have to do is click “Approve” once you receive the notification. You will then have access to your company’s resources. If a push notification comes through that you did not request, simply click “Deny.” This will prevent bad actors from accessing your account.\nAlternatively, if you choose TOTP to authenticate, you would need to use the six-digit code generated by JumpCloud Protect mobile app and enter the code within the requested application or JumpCloud’s User Portal to gain access.\nTOTP helps users avoid having to memorize passcodes and provides greater security compared to a user-created passcode. TOTP is also easier to use and more secure than authentication codes sent via SMS. TOTP does not require your mobile device to be connected to Wi-Fi or a cellular network to use."

      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected. For security reasons, LuxTrust do not accept rooted or jailbroken devices and cannot be held liable in case such devices are used.\nTo remain protect at all times, do not disclose your security codes, PINs, and passwords to anyone. \nIf you suspect that your device or credentials have been compromised, stop using the app and immediately notify LuxTrust by telephone at +352 24 550 550. Our colleagues from Helpdesk will offer you support and guidance. \n\nABOUT LUXTRUST\nLuxTrust is leading European electronic identity and trust services provider.

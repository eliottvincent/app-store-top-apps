      "label": "Never be without a schedule of California’s permanent disability values again.  The iComp Calculator by Haight Brown & Bonesteel, LLP displays the compensation rate and permanent disability value for any date of injury after 1983.  You input the average weekly earnings and it calculates the TTD rate and PD rate.  You input the percentage of permanent disability; the App calculates the number of weeks of payment, the lump sum value of permanent disability and, where appropriate, the life pension weekly rate for percentages up to 99.75%.  You can’t inadvertently use a permanent disability rate out of range for the date of injury, because the application shows the range permitted for each disability percentage and date.\n\nThis tool replaces all the charts and folders practitioners have had to carry around to obtain permanent disability values in California’s complex system.  The calculator is a short-cut that makes PD charts and tables obsolete.  And, it works off-line!   Try it free for 30 days, then purchase it for $4.99 if you want to continue to use it to save time and effort.\n\nNow, the App provides quick and easy assistance in calculating the number of days between any two dates.  When indemnity is paid between the two dates, the App calculates the sum of the benefits paid during multiple broken periods.  Calculating the total of indemnity benefits paid during several broken cycles, the temporary disability owed over broken periods of time, the percentage of permanent disability to be shared by multiple parties - all are part of the 2015 update.   \n\nCaution is of course required when using the App, and no legal opinion is expressed in providing this application or the results it returns.  Each user remains entirely and solely responsible for the proper use of the application, for confirming that the data used is accurate, and for confirming that the answers provided by the application conform to all the applicable provisions of the California Labor Code. Neither Haight Brown & Bonesteel LLP nor TZT&C LLC warrant neither the accuracy of the results nor the proper use of the application.  No liability will be assumed by the publisher, writer or sponsor of the application for its proper use or accuracy."

Share them by email, text, or social media. You can even print them through a connected printer!\r\nAdministrating the event is also simple. The list of ticket holders can be sorted alphabetically or by ticket number. Attendee’s contact information can be entered in the app to allow for easy ticket distribution. It also makes it easy for you to communicate with ticket holders in the future as needed.\r\n\r\nWith Event Ticket Hero Premium, you can use Dropbox to sync events and ticket lists between devices. This way, you can use a different device to scan tickets at the door than you used to create the tickets!\r\n\r\nDuring the event, tickets can be scanned for entrance and exit. Visual scanning feedback and optional audio feedback makes it easy to distinguish between valid and invalid entries. \r\nAll ticket scanning history is stored on the device scanning tickets. To ensure a ticket is only used once for entry, it is important that a single device is used to scan tickets at the door.\r\n\r\nThis also means that no internet access is required at the event! Even if your concert is in a basement or your private party is at a remote setting off the grid, you can be an Event Ticket Hero!"

      "label": "Shopping is always a fun experience. However, customer satisfaction and trust are essential ingredients for successful long-term customer-supplier relationships. Usually, customer satisfaction originates from a user’s comparison of post-purchase and post-usage evaluation of a product with the expectations held prior to purchase. Sometimes this practice may lead to fall into the counterfeit market trap. Today, unauthorised distributors, retailers and online shops, which may sell fake merchandise without scruples, fool more and more users. Validactor deals with critical issues by providing a powerful product authentication APP that helps users to check for original items even before purchasing.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nThe validation process is a very easy one-step task; it works with each kind of product that has been authenticated through the Validactor QR Codes by its manufacturer.\nYou have just to scan the QR Code on the product label and you’ll immediately get confirmation on the product authenticity in addition to other information, such as brand details, manufacturing date, expiry date and current market status.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nValidactor is unique in providing totally integrated and customisable solutions that enable manufacturers to authenticate and safely protect their products. Either you are a brand enthusiastic or a natural products buyer, you don't need to scratch label, scan bar code or manually input the PIN code to perform product authentication. The intuitive Validactor APP interface will ease out your decision-making process by offering you a completely new approach to the purchasing experience. Validactor APP digital platform offers multi-dimensional features including:\n\n•\tDetailed product information\n•\tExtensive product flagging\n•\tProduct rating display\n•\tWidespread social sharing\n\nBy using the Validactor APP you’ll improve your purchasing experience other than contribute to enforce the following activities: \n\n•\tGet full control on distribution channels\n•\tPrevent brand theft\n•\tAvoid counterfeits in supply chain\n•\tPrevent product losses\n•\tRetrieve lost market share\n•\tEnhance customer loyalty with referral and reward programs"

Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

      "label": "Business made simple\n\nThe SumUp App makes it simple to accept payments and manage your business. Use our free app together with a SumUp mobile card reader to get paid anywhere.\n\nOur app also makes it easy to manage your item catalog, build an online store, sell gift cards, issue invoices, send payment links, and more. These tools are intuitive and involve no binding contracts – all you pay is a fixed fee per transaction. So whether you need a mobile POS solution or you’re looking for new ways to boost your business, we’ve got you covered. \n\nCard payments\nDownload our app and pair your device with a SumUp Card Reader to take chip and contactless payments. With SumUp, you can accept credit cards and debit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay. We also make it simple to set sales tax rates, add tipping options, and issue refunds.\n\nItems \nCreate your own personalized item catalog. Use our payment app to add, edit, and delete items. Having your entire inventory at your fingertips makes transactions speedy and simple. You can also organize your items into categories, to make selling even easier.\n\nPayment Links\nThe flexible way to get paid online. Simply enter the amount you want to charge, create a link, and share it with your customer via social media, SMS, or email. The link will take the customer to a secure website where they can complete the transaction. It’s a great way to take cashless payments without a credit card reader. \n\nInvoices\nWith SumUp Invoices, you can generate professional, legally compliant, on-brand invoices in minutes. When your customer receives an invoice, they’ll have the option to pay securely online. Create and send as many invoices as you like with no service fees. There are also no costs for receiving payment by bank transfer – just a small fixed fee for card payments. \n\t\t\nGift Cards\nInterested in a new revenue stream that requires minimal effort? Open the SumUp App and you’ll find a gift card page for your business, ready to share. Your customers can buy digital gift cards for any amount, and personalize them by picking from a range of designs. You can manage the balance of every gift card you sell within the SumUp App."

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

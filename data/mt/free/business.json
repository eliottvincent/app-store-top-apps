During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

      "label": "Keeping track of the hours you work has never been easier. Whether you're self-employed, a freelance artist or a private contractor, it's important to keep an accurate record of the time you spend on-the-clock.\n\nUnlike other complicated time clock utilities, Punch Time Clock requires zero setup or configuration to begin logging your time. Simply tap 'Clock in' and get to work. Tell the app when you start and end breaks, then finally clock out when you're finished. Review your Log to see a detailed list of completed shifts, make changes, or add and delete entries. At any time you're able to export the log for your personal records or send to a client or employer.\n\nYou're only as efficient as the tools you use. With intuitive functionality, all the features you need and none you don't, Punch helps you track your hours-worked without getting in the way.\n\nFeatures:\n\n:: FULLY EDITABLE LOGS ::\nCreate a shift from scratch. Adjust the time you clocked in yesterday. Add a break you forgot to log during Saturday's shift. You are in total control of your timesheets.\n\n:: LOG EXPORTING :: *\nSimply select a pay period, year, month or custom date range and Punch will list the matching entries in a nicely formatted table you can then email to yourself, a client, or the boss with a single tap! Attached to the email is a CSV spreadsheet file with the exported data which can be easily imported into your record keeping software of choice.\n\n:: CUSTOM PAY PERIODS ::\nPunch allows you to record your hours worked based on the frequency of your paychecks. Some people get paid weekly with their pay periods ending on Saturday, while others are paid every two weeks on Thursday. You can setup your pay schedule in the Settings screen. You only need to do this once.\n\n:: EARNINGS ESTIMATES :: *\nSet how much you're paid and what percentage you expect to be taxed and Punch automatically calculates your paychecks based on the hours you've worked for each pay period. You can also set optional overtime thresholds (both daily and weekly) that are paid at a different rate after a certain number of hours have been worked.\n\n:: MULTIPLE BREAKS PER SHIFT ::\nTwo lunch breaks, three smoke-breaks, or fifteen \"gotta-check-my-instagram\" breaks; Record all of your [completely justified] off-the-clock time.\n\n:: CUSTOM LABELS :: *\nWhether you work multiple jobs, manage different projects, or simply want to make note of what you accomplished, labeling entries is easy and effective.\n\n:: ENTRY NOTES :: *\nNotes are a great place can keep track of mileage, justify overtime worked, summarize what you accomplished, or just keep personal records regarding your shift.\n\n:: RETROACTIVE CLOCK-INS ::\nForgot to clock in? No problem. It's like the having your own time-machine. (Except, instead of influencing past events to alter the course of human history.. you're clocking in a few minutes earlier.)\n\n:: FUTURE CLOCK-OUTS ::\nIf you know what time you'll be calling it quits, the app will handle the rest. (See: Time Machine, mundane uses of)\n\n:: SMART SHIFT PERSISTENCE ::\nNever lose your progress.  Even if the app is closed or your device is restarted, tracking is uninterrupted and picks up where you left off.\n\n:: DARK MODE :: *\nRegardless of whether you think you're a ninja ... or just want to save your eyes from unnecessary eye-strain in dark rooms. Dark Mode is for you.\n\nPunch Time Clock will always be free to use, forever. All core features needed to track your time are unlocked with zero limitations. If you wish you support our app and its continued improvement, a Pro upgrade is available that will unlock extra features, denoted above with an asterisk (*), and increase your productivity even more. Your support is greatly appreciated!\n\nIf you have a moment and can leave us a short review & rating we would be extremely grateful! Please send us an email if you have any questions or comments. Thank you."

Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

Today, unauthorised distributors, retailers and online shops, which may sell fake merchandise without scruples, fool more and more users. Validactor deals with critical issues by providing a powerful product authentication APP that helps users to check for original items even before purchasing.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nThe validation process is a very easy one-step task; it works with each kind of product that has been authenticated through the Validactor QR Codes by its manufacturer.\nYou have just to scan the QR Code on the product label and you’ll immediately get confirmation on the product authenticity in addition to other information, such as brand details, manufacturing date, expiry date and current market status.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nValidactor is unique in providing totally integrated and customisable solutions that enable manufacturers to authenticate and safely protect their products.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly.

This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

With a single tap, track and save your time with Toggl Track — anywhere you go.\n\nOr maybe you don't really want to use the pesky phone keyboard — we get it. That's why you can now use Siri to track your time with Toggl Track, no keyboard is needed.\n\nToggl Track also has you covered across all of your devices. Start tracking your hours in a browser, then stop it later on your phone or on your Apple Watch with our brand new watchOS app. All your tracked time is safely synced between your iPhone, Watch, desktop, and browser (if you want more of a Pomodoro timer experience).\n\nFEATURES:\n• Pomodoro mode\nEnjoy better focus and productivity by trying out the Pomodoro technique with our brand new Pomodoro mode. The idea behind the Pomodoro technique is that you can work more effectively when you work in timed, 25-minute increments (with breaks in between). Our built-in timer automatically tracks your time in 25-minute increments, with notifications, a full screen mode, and countdown timer to really help you stay focused and on task.\n\n• Reports\nDiscover what's taking up your time and get a snapshot of your day or week with Reports. Analyze your Reports in the app or export them to send the data to your clients (or analyze them further on our web app to see where your hours are going).\n\n• Sync\nKeeps your time seamlessly synced, safely saved, and ready to track on your account, on any device.\n\n• Calendar\nConnect your calendar app to Toggl Track to see all of your calendar events and time entries in the app itself (in the same view), receive notifications before the events start, and most importantly, instantly create time entries based on your calendar events!\n\n• Customize your time entries with projects, clients, and tags\nOrganize and add more details to your time entries by adding meta data on projects, clients, and tags. See exactly where your work hours are going and adjust your schedule and routines accordingly.\n\n• Siri\nToggl Track is compatible with Siri! Start a new time entry, stop it, or access your reports — all that with just a few words.\n\n• iOS Widgets\nStart (and stop) tracking from your iPhone Home Screen.\n\n• Apple Sign-in\nYou can now also sign into our Toggl Track app via your Apple ID.\n\n• Suggestions\nThe more you track, the better the data. The app will give you suggested time entries based on your tracking habits and previous time entries.\n\n• Shortcuts\nUse @ and # to quickly add projects and tags to your time entry and get back to work right away!\n\n• Auto-complete\nEasily find your older time entries and start tracking time on them again.\n\n• Manual Mode\nWant more control? Add and edit all of your time manually and make sure that every second of your time is accounted for. This feature is optional and it's accessible from the Settings menu.\n\n-----\n\n- But what if I'm offline?\nNo problem! You can still track your time through the app, and once you're back online, it will sync seamlessly with your account (and the rest of your devices). Your time is not going anywhere.\n\n- Is the app free?\nYes, Toggl Track on iOS is completely free for you to use.\n\n- Can I send you some feedback?\nYou betcha (and we'd love to hear from you)! You can send us feedback directly from the app. Just look for “Submit Feedback” in the Settings menu.\n\nYep, that's Toggl Track — a time tracking app so simple that you'll actually use it and get stuff done! See where your time goes, focus on important tasks, and boost your productivity. Whether you’re in an office or en route to one, stuck on a space mission to Mars, or just want to see how much time you're wasting on projects that aren't bringing you money — track your time anywhere you go."

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

      "label": "The BILL app simplifies business payments for companies of all sizes. Whether you’re focused on accounts payable, accounts receivable, or just looking for an easy way to collect payments from a customer, BILL streamlines tedious, manual processes—saving you 50% of the time spent paying and approving bills and helping you get paid 2x faster.\n\nRECEIVE PAYMENTS\nGet paid faster by your customers and other businesses using BILL. Track your incoming payments to know when you’ll be paid.\n\nAPPROVE BILLS ON THE GO\nNo need for your approvers to be in the office for a handwritten signature. Approvers can review, ask questions, and approve or deny a bill right from their phone.\n\nPAY EASILY, ELECTRONICALLY\nLeave check runs in the past. Payment options include domestic ACH, international wires in USD or local currency*, virtual card, or checks that we mail for you.\n\nMANAGE PAYMENTS IN ONE PLACE\nSee important action items—like pending approvals and payments—on one simple overview screen, so you’re always up to speed and on track.\n\n*Initial vendor setup from your desktop is required before sending international payments using the mobile app.\n\n\nWHAT CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING\n“The [BILL] mobile app gives me the ability to pay bills while I’m away from the office.”\n- Roberta Hopkins, CFO, Georgetown Visitation\n\n“Everyone at Spikeball uses the mobile app. Our employees submit their expense reports into [BILL] and they can easily track when they’ll get reimbursed. Our contractors use the mobile app to send bills to me. Now when I’m on vacation, I don’t need to take my computer with me since I can do everything I need with the [BILL] mobile app.”\n- Jurie Victor, Finance Manager, Spikeball"

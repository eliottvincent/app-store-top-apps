Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

      "label": "It’s free to try. Plan time, track attendance, schedule, and message with your mobile workforce. Employee Link schedules and tracks the time and GPS location of your crew's clock in and outs. It includes two unique apps in one. For the employee, a simple time clock app and for you, the employer, a powerful labor management app to simplify and increase the productivity of your business. Increase the productivity of your business and your workforce with the Employee Link hours tracker.\n\nAdd \"smart tasks\" to jobs then schedule your workforce on the shiftboard. Your crew will receive push notifications when they are added to a schedule and when their schedule is updated. Productivity increases when your workforce knows what they are working on and where and when they work in advance. Keep your crew informed by adding job notes and pictures to your scheduled tasks. The shiftboard displays a simple overview of schedule \"time-blocks\" for your entire workforce. It's fast and easy to plan your week of work and organize your crew at the same time. Employee Link is the homebase for your workplace schedules.\n \nSee when your employees are on the clock, if they arrived on time, and where their clock in and out happened with GPS. Get daily updates of your crew's timesheet organized by pay period. Choose between a detailed time log containing start, end, and lunch times, or simply the total hours worked for each shift. View overtime hours and export your timesheet as a pdf to email. The hours tracker gives you an update to date timesheet with total time worked to the day. It's a must for managing a mobile crew.\n \nThe Employee Link hours tracker is so simple to learn your whole crew will be able to clock in and start tracking time right away. With one click they can view tasks on their schedule and tap their task to mark it complete. Your crew can even add notes to describe the tasks they worked on. Increase productivity and decrease overtime by tracking attendance and break time length. \n \nMessage your entire crew at once with mobile workforce messaging. Set announcements to make sure everyone is aware of important messages. Alert your crew of last minute changes so everyone knows on time.\n \nPay day is simple with the gross pay calculator. Select an employee to see their total hours worked and gross pay for a pay period timesheet. With one click, mark workdays for an employee as ’paid’. Time tracking time with Employee Link keeps your timesheets organized and boosts the productivity of tasks on pay day.\n \nLog hours by job for additional job labor cost tracking. View all the hours logged under a specific job id or name and see the gross amount of wages you have paid over the course of the job. \n \nOrganize your workplace, schedule your workforce, clock your crew's hours, receive regular timesheet updates and export your timesheet by email to yourself or your accountant. Employee Link is the number one free hours tracker and schedule app. It's the homebase for your mobile workplace!\n \nAdditional In App Purchase Information\n \n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n \nPrivacy Policy\nhttps://morgantrudeau.github.io/employee-link-privacy-policy/\n \nTerms of Use\nhttps://morgantrudeau.github.io/employee-link-terms-of-use/"

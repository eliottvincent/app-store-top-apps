The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

Companies who are embracing this change want to be seen on the forefront, supporting employees who are unable to register for work at the office.\n\nIndigo Mobile is available as a tool to better manage remote workers on the go.\n\nFeatures:\n•\tShift/Roster Calendar: Allow employees to view their shifts from their phone.\n•\tClock In and Out: Allow employees to clock in and clock out of each shift directly from their phone.\n•\tGPS Location Capture: Monitor off-site employees’ locations when they clock in or out from a shift.\n•\tAccountability: Be in a position to be able to account for your team’s location, whether in the office or on a remote site. This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

JumpCloud Protect enables multi-factor authentication (MFA) or two-factor authentication (2FA) that ensures it is only you who is accessing the resources.\nMFA provides an extra layer of security on top of your username and password. When using MFA, you will first be prompted to enter your username and password. You will then be asked to either receive a push notification or a enter a verification code also known as Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) as a second factor to login. \nIf you request a push notification, all you have to do is click “Approve” once you receive the notification. You will then have access to your company’s resources. If a push notification comes through that you did not request, simply click “Deny.” This will prevent bad actors from accessing your account.\nAlternatively, if you choose TOTP to authenticate, you would need to use the six-digit code generated by JumpCloud Protect mobile app and enter the code within the requested application or JumpCloud’s User Portal to gain access.\nTOTP helps users avoid having to memorize passcodes and provides greater security compared to a user-created passcode. TOTP is also easier to use and more secure than authentication codes sent via SMS. TOTP does not require your mobile device to be connected to Wi-Fi or a cellular network to use."

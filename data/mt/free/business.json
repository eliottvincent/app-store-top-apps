Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

This is particularly important where incidents may occur and you may be responsible to account for your employees.\n•\tMultiple Profiles: Employees can use the app for different jobs they may have, by registering multiple profiles.\n•\tCosting Saving: Eliminate the need for costly punch/clock in devices on site at your premises.\n•\tSecurity: Activate manual punches for a selection of users when an employee forgets to punch through their mobile app, or is unable to punch due to for example, their mobile running out of battery."

      "label": "KPA EHS is a powerful yet flexible safety management app for reporting, training, alerts, tasks, inspections and more. Strategically improve safety, regulatory compliance and productivity.\n\nTOP KPA EHS APP FEATURES\n\n· View Open Tasks\n· Submit Reports\n· Analyze Real-Time Data\n· Access Training and Verify Completions\n· Send and Receive Push Notifications\n· Conduct Equipment Inspections\n· Access Safety and Regulatory Resources\n\nNEED HELP SIGNING IN? Contact your safety advisor at your company. They will provide you with a username and password.\n\nABOUT KPA EHS\n\nView Open Tasks Keeping up with schedules, job tasks, safety documentation and general record-keeping can be a struggle. KPA EHS can systemize safety and compliance requirements, including training needs, reports, evaluations and equipment inspections. An Open Task list allows specified employees to issue, receive, and confirm completion of tasks that need attention.\n\nSubmit Reports You can’t improve what you don’t measure or track. However, paper-driven reporting processes can be inefficient and time-consuming. Having accurate and timely reporting is critical for awareness and accident prevention.\n\nThe app streamlines accident, near-miss, and safety observation reporting by making collection and management processes easy and intuitive. Submit reports, include photos, videos or even a sketch, in the field, all from your smart phone or tablet.\n\nAnalyze Real-Time Data Past performance and current circumstances identify areas of improvement and vulnerabilities in the work environment. These become indicators to track, trend, and communicate prevention strategies to avoid future mishaps.\n\nYou’ll get instant data analysis, including trends, graphs, and summary reports for real-time awareness of existing conditions and areas in need of improvement.\n\nAccess Training and Verify Completion If you can’t demonstrate your employees are well informed and trained to do their jobs safely, you’re exposing your people to potentially deadly risks while putting your business on the line. Give your employees access to KPA’s award-winning safety and compliance training anywhere, anytime.\n\nEmployees can take training on the go via the mobile app, and safety managers and admins track training completions and renewal periods for each employee. KPA’s training library includes general OSHA-recommended safety training, industry-specific training, and fully customizable courses. Send and Receive Push Notifications\n\nCommunication is paramount to the success of any organization, but how can you confirm the message was delivered accurately and on time? Send and receive push notifications for critical reports and tasks.\n\nConduct Equipment Inspections The health and condition of tools and equipment is critical to the success and safety of any job. With the app, automatically schedule inspections of tools and equipment and document the results. Each asset is assigned a QR code. With the app, scan a QR code and it will show the equipment profile along with its inspection status. Team members can then easily conduct a quick inspection in seconds.\n\nAccess Safety and Regulatory Resources Up-to-date processes, policy, and procedures should remain accessible to employees at all times.\n\nWith the KPA EHS app, employees have easy access to all policy and procedures–even when off-line."

Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

Score 100% in the games and you can unlock an extra topic for free.\n\n\nWHY UTALK WORKS:\n\n1. LEARN FROM THE LOCALS: We record native speakers so you hear every word pronounced clearly. Mimic their pronunciation and compare your intonation with theirs. Practise until you get it right – you can even slow the audio down if it’s too fast.\n\n2. USEFUL EVERYDAY WORDS AND PHRASES. Topics take around two to three hours to complete. But you can dip in for just five minutes at a time or longer. With 60+ topics, that’s a total of 180 hours of learning.\n\n3. KEEPS YOU MOTIVATED: Check your scores on progress bars as you move through five progressively difficult games. To get full marks, you’ll have to know the words as well as your own language.\n\n\nWHO’S IT FOR? uTalk’s tried and trusted way to learn a new language has been developed over 30 years and is perfect for beginners.

      "label": "Learn something new in just 5 minutes, with daily bite-sized knowledge from books, articles, videos, podcasts & more. Over 1 million bright minds saved more than 14 million ideas in their personal library so far.\n\nIt's like your social media feed, if your social media feed had things that mattered :-)\n\nKnowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.\n\nIdeas are created by Deepstash members, called stashers. Whenever a stasher reads a book article or listens to a podcast and they find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, they will add an idea about it in Deepstash.\n\nA daily source of inspiring & life changing stories and ideas. Read articles, learn skills, get productivity tips and discover life hacks. The magic of Deepstash is that everything you do builds your knowledge library: be it contributing  your own ideas or collecting idea cards from other stashers. Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.\n\nPERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS\n\nChoose a few topics of interest (more than 4,000 topics to choose from) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.\n\nThe more you save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.\n\nBUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nYou can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.\n\nSearch and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes, which are basically collections of insights stocked up and ready to go for when you need them: a Powerpoint presentation, a new job interview, a date, a project at work, or negotiating your rent with the landlord.\n\nSHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nAdd your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.\n\nShare your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this. \n\nShare a link to ideas or just an image. We built special image formats for each social network (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and others) so your ideas will look their best.\n\nNO ADS. NO DISTRACTIONS\n\nThe Deepstash app is free and open to everyone. Get a clean reading experience and focus on the content instead of being distracted with annoying ads. Just get a quick free account (Facebook & Google login) and you’re good to go.\n\nGood for your career. \nGreat for your life. \nGive it a shot!\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://deepstash.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://deepstash.com/privacy-policy"

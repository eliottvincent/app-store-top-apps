      "label": "Why You Need This Driving Licence App:\nG1 ontario is the #1 app for G1 test prep so you'll pass the first time. It's the fastest way to prepare.\nDriving is awesome but passing the G1 test shouldn't be so complex. We make it easy for you to be fully prepared by providing easy-to-use tools to make studying effortless and fun. Rather than try to memorize boring facts and numbers, get comfortable answering exam-like questions that range from easy to knuckle-cracking hard. You won’t even notice you're studying; you’ll want to keep taking the tests until you pass them all.\n\nJoin the thousands of Ontario learner drivers who passed their G1 written test using this app. With G1, you’ll breeze through your exam and walk out of the DriveTest center, feeling like you just took a first-grade spelling test.\n\nTake your G1 ontario prep to the next level with the super-realistic Exam, Handbook, wrong answered question test, and more. Recommended by top driving schools and independent driving instructors.\n\nDownload it right now, be ready to ace your G1 exam tomorrow.\n\nWhat you’ll love about G1:\n\n• All 290 exam-like questions based on the Ontario Driver's Handbook and seen on the official exam.\n• The realistic G1 Exams is as close as it gets to the actual G1 driver's test experience. It mimics the experience of a real G1 test.\n• Re-Solve is a new type of test that's automatically made up of your missed questions from all your practice tests. You can go back and review the questions that you got wrong.\n• Passing Probability score is calculated in real time based on your activity and displays how you'd score on the official G1 test if you took it today.\n• Simple and fun to use: We’ve simplified the vague and complex language of driving rules so you can quickly master the concepts and answer the question correctly next time, no matter how it’s worded on the exam.\n• Works offline: no internet connection needed.\n\nG1 is the perfect practice app for beginners, but it also includes plenty of challenging G1 practice questions for renewal applicants and advanced drivers. Every question is based on the official Driver's Handbook issued by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario so you can be sure you're studying the most recent materials.\n\nOur users swear that most of the questions on the real G1 test are very similar (often identical) to those G1 offers. You’ll know exactly what to expect since our practice tests have the same scoring system as the actual G1 test.\n\n\"Really prepares you for the G1 test. I passed with flying colours and it’s the closest thing you can get to taking the actual test in advance. So worth it!\" - Terry G., Markham\n\n\"Just study with this every day for like 30 mins and when you write the actual exam you'll be fine.\" - Jaden Bediako, Team Canada, National basketball player\n\nYou'll be surprised how close the app is to the real thing!"

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

RANKED #1 APP FOR KIDS on APP Store in many countries. \n\nLet's come and play with me! \nThis new user-friendly wonderful Abby's Magic Laptop for Preschool and Toddlers welcomes you to the colorful world of exploration and learning! This adorable learn and play laptop teaches children letters, numbers, colors, shapes, animals, toys, fruits, musical instruments, and more. Kids will love switching between categories. Actions lead to learning!\n\nThe application offers you in total the possibility of choosing from 12(!) thematic categories. Children will be thrilled to play with this laptop and learn new things.  The numerous buttons the laptop offers invite exploration and enable children to determine their own pace of learning according to their individual needs.\n\nThe laptop includes two game modes: 'Let's Play!' and 'Let's Learn!' The switching between the modes is made easy by two large red buttons. Children typically do not experience problems learning to activate these two modes, but in case they do, we encourage parents to switch the mode\nfor their children.\n\n*Let's Play!*\nThe 'Let's Play!' mode is designed primarily for children unfamiliar with the objects included, or those who want to refresh and enhance their knowledge of the already acquired vocabulary. To activate the mode, simply press the 'Let's play!' button,  and choose a desired thematic category from one of the blue buttons in the upper half of the gaming space. For instance, after pressing a blue button with a picture of a ball, there are going to appear buttons with toys theme on the lower half of the gaming screen. When pressing the individual picture buttons then, the pictures are going to appear enlarged on the laptop monitor, the pronounced name and the written form of the word as well as its authentic sound and small animation follows afterwards.\n\n*Let's Learn!*\nDo you want some practice too? Don't forget to try the 'Let's Learn!' mode! To activate this mode, tap on the 'Let's Learn' button. Afterwards, choose one of the twelve thematic categories and let the challenge begin! When the category has been selected, an enthusiastic monkey Abby appears on the laptop monitor and gives tasks to a child. The task is always to select the picture of the correct item that she pronounced. Of course, after each correct answer, the cute monkey provides words of praise and\nencouragement.\n\nTo make the laptop more engaging, we also included four colorful buttons in the lower half of the game screen. These simulate the functions of a videophone and include such funny effects such as entertaining sound effects and melodies.\n\nThank you for selecting our app! We sincerely hope your children will enjoy it!\n\nYour 22learn team!"

Topics take around two to three hours to complete. But you can dip in for just five minutes at a time or longer. With 60+ topics, that’s a total of 180 hours of learning.\n\n3. KEEPS YOU MOTIVATED: Check your scores on progress bars as you move through five progressively difficult games. To get full marks, you’ll have to know the words as well as your own language.\n\n\nWHO’S IT FOR? uTalk’s tried and trusted way to learn a new language has been developed over 30 years and is perfect for beginners. But its wide-ranging language is also invaluable for intermediates looking to improve their vocabulary and pronunciation.\n\nHOW IT WORKS: Subscribe to everything on uTalk or buy individual languages or topics.

      "label": "Brainscape’s SMART FLASHCARDS foster hyper-efficient studying and strong habits to DOUBLE your learning speed, with the strongest implementation of spaced repetition and active recall of any flashcard app on the planet! (And probably in the universe, assuming some super intelligent alien species out there hasn’t beaten us to it.)\n\nWith a knowledge bank created by millions of global users and experts, you can FIND, MAKE, and SHARE flashcards anytime, anywhere, and on any device, while keeping all your content meticulously ORGANIZED and seamlessly IN SYNC across web, mobile, and all your devices.\n\nHow does it work? Brainscape’s intelligent study system has been designed in accordance with decades of proven cognitive science to help you learn faster and remember longer than with any other flashcard app. (And we don’t waste time on games. Our flashcards are for serious learners.)\n\nBrainscape distills any subject down into bite-sized facts (neatly organized into decks and classes), which are posed as question-and-answer pairs, compelling you to actively recall information from scratch. You then rate how well you know each concept on a scale of 1 to 5, and Brainscape determines the perfect time interval at which to repeat that flashcard again. \n\nIf you know the answer well, you’ll see that flashcard less often; if you don’t know it well, you’ll see it again and again, at frequent intervals, until it’s deeply ingrained into your brain. And it’s this totally unique combination of active recall, self-assessment (metacognition), and spaced repetition that is scientifically proven to significantly slash your required study time!\n\nWhere do all of Brainscape’s awesome flashcards come from? Three places:\n\nTHE WORLD’S TOP EXPERTS. Brainscape partners with top publishers, schools, and educators to create comprehensive collections of certified flashcards for a diverse array of subjects, from foreign languages (we are the best language-learning tool in the world) to high-stakes exams like the AP series, MBE (bar exam), Series 7, NCLEX, MCAT, and more.\n\nYOUR PEERS. Top students, professors, teachers, tutorpreneurs, and businesses around the world have created over 1 million subjects that are available to search on Brainscape’s Knowledge Genome.\n\nYOU! You can easily create and organize thousands of multimedia flashcards featuring text, images, and even audio files, both on Brainscape’s website AND within the app itself. You can also share your decks with your classmates and collaboratively develop content together. \n\nHow much does it cost? Creating and sharing great flashcards is FREE. (Woohoo!) And for unlimited access to ALL of Brainscape's user-generated and premium, expert-curated content, as well as optional features, like bookmarks and card reversibility, you can upgrade to Pro for $19.99 (monthly), $59.99 (every 6 months), or $95.99 (annually). Alternatively, you can unlock a LIFETIME of learning with Brainscape for a one-time cost of only $199.99 American dolla billz.\n \nThe fine print: The three recurring subscriptions (monthly, semiannual, and annual) will renew automatically within 24 hours before the end of the current period, unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the period. You can cancel auto-renewal any time by going to Account Settings, and the cancellation will apply after the active subscription period is complete. Go ahead and learn more about our Terms and Privacy Policy at brainscape.com/terms.\n\nWhat’s on the horizon? It’s our vision to empower everyone, everywhere to rise to the challenge of personalized forever-learning. And for this reason, we love hearing from our community of users: it’s through your feedback that we can continue to innovate our learning platform to be more convenient, efficient, and even fun and social to use!"

      "label": "Jamais dans l'histoire de l'humanité il n'y a eu autant d'êtres humains fuyant leur domicile, voire leur pays. En 2020, ce sont plus de 80 millions de personnes concernées. Elles vivent des expériences inconcevables, se retrouvent dans des situations précaires, ignorent quel sera leur avenir.\nFuir a également été l'une des seules possibilités pour celles et ceux qui ont survécu au projet d'extermination nazi. Avec la disparition des derniers témoins, il ne restera bientôt personne pour transmettre l'expérience vécue et tangible de la Shoah. Cela est d'autant plus regrettable que les témoignages constituent des sources d'information précieuses et touchantes pour les jeunes générations. A travers ces récits, l'histoire prend vie et visages.\nL'application \"Fuir la Shoah\" propose aux jeunes, dès l'âge de 14 ans, d'accéder à des ressources historiques uniques grâce à un support numérique basé sur des témoignages filmés et des documents authentiques. Elle peut être utilisée en classe ou individuellement.\nL'application est téléchargée gratuitement sur ordinateur, tablette ou smartphone. La bande-annonce familiarise l'utilisateur avec l'objet de l'application et lance la rencontre avec des témoins.Le cœur de l'application est constitué de cinq témoignages audiovisuels de personnes qui racontent leur histoire durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale et la façon dont elles ont réussi à réchapper de la Shoah. \nChaque histoire est singulière. Mises ensemble, elles couvrent une variété de parcours et de destinées. Elles traitent de la vie d'avant, du vécu pendant la Shoah (persécutions, fuite, rafles, déportation, enfants cachés, refuge en Suisse) et de la vie d'après.\nL'utilisateur visionne à choix un témoignage dont la durée est d'une vingtaine de minutes. Le récit est accompagné d'explications contextuelles succinctes. Il est divisé en quatre étapes chronologiques correspondant à autant de domaines thématiques. L'utilisateur choisit deux domaines qu'il souhaite approfondir.\nL'utilisateur poursuit son parcours en recueillant des informations complémentaires proposées dans l'application, analyse des documents, énonce des hypothèses, formule des constats. Il peut ainsi enrichir sa compréhension du témoignage entendu et s'exprimer à titre personnel. \nLe parcours est documenté par le biais d'un album numérique généré automatiquement et qui peut être envoyé par mail à une ou plusieurs personnes de son choix. L'album constitue une trace personnelle de la rencontre virtuelle avec un témoin. Aucune donnée n'est récoltée par un tiers.\nL'utilisation de l'application est facilité par des modalités simples et gratuites de téléchargement. Elle fonctionne hors ligne et ne requiert pas d'accès au réseau durant son utilisation. \nDu matériel pédagogique est à disposition sur le site Internet dédié à l'app."

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

It is the smartest way to perfect your English, and learn every word that matters while enjoying the process!\r\n\r\nWordUp helps you to build a MAP of your KNOWLEDGE. Every word you know, and every word you don't. All 25,000 useful English words are ranked in the order of IMPORTANCE, and USEFULNESS, based on how often they are used in real-world spoken English (extracted from thousands of movies, and TV shows).\r\n\r\nBy creating your Knowledge Map in WordUp, you constantly discover the most valuable next word to learn that you don't know yet, and focus on learning them in that order. It's the smartest way to spend your time learning!\r\n\r\nTo actually learn the words that you discover in your Knowledge Map, WordUp gives you everything you need, and more! From word definitions and pictures to tens of entertaining examples from movies, quotes, news, and more. So you get a good feel of how to use each word in context. There are also translations in more than 30 languages including French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, ...\r\n\r\nThe daily reviews then kick in. Like flashcards, the words will come back with games and challenges until you master them. It's called Spaced Repetition, and it's scientifically proven to help memorise them forever!\r\n\r\nWordUp is unlike any vocabulary builder app you've seen before. It is not another dictionary app, although it can be used as an English dictionary too. \r\n\r\nWordUp's novel approach to language learning and expanding your vocabulary will leave you feeling confident and empowered. Whether you are new to English, are preparing for an English exam (IELTS, TOEFL, etc), or are a native English speaker, you will find WordUp helpful and entertaining. Just give it a try and see for yourself!"

Score 100% in the games and you can unlock an extra topic for free.\n\n\nWHY UTALK WORKS:\n\n1. LEARN FROM THE LOCALS: We record native speakers so you hear every word pronounced clearly. Mimic their pronunciation and compare your intonation with theirs. Practise until you get it right – you can even slow the audio down if it’s too fast.\n\n2. USEFUL EVERYDAY WORDS AND PHRASES. Topics take around two to three hours to complete. But you can dip in for just five minutes at a time or longer. With 60+ topics, that’s a total of 180 hours of learning.\n\n3. KEEPS YOU MOTIVATED: Check your scores on progress bars as you move through five progressively difficult games. To get full marks, you’ll have to know the words as well as your own language.\n\n\nWHO’S IT FOR? uTalk’s tried and trusted way to learn a new language has been developed over 30 years and is perfect for beginners.

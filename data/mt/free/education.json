Un balayage (swipe) à droite ou à gauche vous permettra de passer à la carte suivante.\n\nLes mots ainsi que leur traduction sont prononcés (en italien et en français) afin que vous puissiez bénéficier de la mémoire auditive. Par la même occasion, vous pourrez perfectionner votre accent en italien.\n\nCette liste de plus de 40 000 mots, est subdivisée en 2 listes Italien-Français et Français-Italien, puis par ordre alphabétique (première lettre du mot).\n\nEn plus du vocabulaire courant (verbes, noms, adjectifs communs), elle contient du vocabulaire plus spécifique: termes techniques, noms propres, argot. Etant donné son étendue, elle peut aisément s’adresser à des personnes parlant déjà couramment l’italien, souhaitant se perfectionner.\n\nVous avez la possibilité d’ajouter des mots à votre liste personnelle (vocabulaire que vous ne maitrisez pas) en vue de la rejouer plus tard.\n\nCette application est gratuite mais est financée par les publicités qui s’affichent. Nous vous remercions d’autoriser cette application à suivre vos activités dans les apps et sur les sites webs d’autres sociétés. Cela vous pemettra d’éviter d’être dérangé par des publicités non ciblées."

GLOBE Clouds allows observers to make regular observations of the Earth’s cloud cover and compare them to NASA satellite observations. With GLOBE Mosquito Habitat Mapper, users locate mosquito habitats, observe and identify mosquito larvae, and reduce the potential threat of mosquito borne disease. GLOBE Land Cover is designed to allow users to document what is on the land (trees, grass, buildings, etc.). GLOBE Trees asks users to estimate a tree’s height by taking pictures of trees with their device and answering a few questions. Additional capabilities may be added. \r\n\r\nBy using the GLOBE Observer app, you are joining the GLOBE community and contributing important scientific data to NASA and GLOBE, your local community, and students and scientists worldwide. The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program is an international science and education program that provides students and the public worldwide with the opportunity to participate in data collection and the scientific process, and contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the Earth system and global environment."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "La nuova App ti accompagna all'interno del Museo in un percorso di visita unico, dove il segreto del Cenacolo è svelato attraverso una curata narrazione che si focalizza sugli aspetti storico artistici e sulle peculiarità conservative dell’opera, aiutando il visitatore a comprendere il senso delle scelte operate da Leonardo sia dal punto di vista tecnico che compositivo. All’interno del Refettorio, la visita è arricchita da innovative esperienze in realtà aumentata. Il percorso Al Cenacolo Vinciano si sblocca in automatico quando, acquistato il biglietto ed attivato il Bluetooth, ti troverai all’interno del Museo o nell’area Biglietteria.\nLa sezione Storie, invece, è dedicata ad approfondimenti che aiutano a contestualizzare l’opera dal punto di vista storico – artistico grazie a schede di testo corredate da un accurato apparato iconografico che comprende video e immagini a 360°. \nAlle famiglie con bambini è dedicato un percorso specifico, con due video di presentazione dell’opera e quattro giochi interattivi.\nInfine, per permettere di ampliare la conoscenza dell’opera di Leonardo e la vastità della sua impronta sul territorio lombardo in generale e sulla città di Milano in particolare, sono stati predisposti gli itinerari leonardeschi: attraverso una mappa si potranno localizzare i luoghi dove Leonardo ha lavorato o dove sono conservate le sue opere e visualizzarne le informazioni essenziali.\n\nLa nuova app del Cenacolo Vinciano è pensata per tutti: in otto lingue, con percorsi di visita inclusivi e completamente fruibili grazie alle tracce audio e alle trascrizioni integrali. Inoltre, grazie alla collaborazione con l’Associazione Nazionale Subvedenti (ANS) nell’ambito del progetto DescriVedendo abbiamo realizzato una audio descrizione dell’Ultima Cena che renda accessibile il capolavoro leondardesco anche alle persone con ridotta o nulla capacità visiva. All’interno del Refettorio è presente un beacon che ti consentirà di ascoltare l’audio descrizione dell’Ultima Cena: attiva il bluetooth quando sei nel Museo.\n\nNella cultura open-content sostenuta dal Polo Museale abbiamo reso tutto questo accessibile gratuitamente. Abbiamo scelto di permetterti di sbloccare i contenuti del percorso di Visita del Cenacolo solo dall’interno del Museo, perché tu possa scoprirli nel contesto dove questi hanno più significato, e beneficiare dell’esperienza completa che abbiamo progettato per te."

Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

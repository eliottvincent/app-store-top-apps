      "label": "Learn French, Spanish, Russian, German, Italian, Portuguese and Thai!\n\nGet addicted to learning Spanish with the most fun way to learn a language! Instead of wasting time on an addictive game, why not learn a language using an addictive game? This is the first ever app to learn Spanish that is designed like an actual video game with online play. Meant for people of all ages and beginners to advanced students.\n\nTrap your first beast!\nTo survive Langlandia and advance in the institution, you must have a strong beast. Will it be a ferocious polar bear? A noble lion? A tiger? A wolf? A giant snake? Another? Or will you get lucky and get one of the mythical beasts like a yeti or even a dragon.\n\nYou will trap your baby beast and grow with him as he becomes more powerful and you become smarter (in Spanish). You are a team and will need him to get back home from this mysterious island.\n\n1v1 Online Battles (PvP):\nBattle with friends or other students online in the 1v1 arena league to see who is best learning the language.\n\nTournaments, Clan Wars, Weekly Event Competitions, Challenges, Online Boss Battles, Online Exam Competitions:\nCompete with other students for prizes and motivate yourself to master the language.\n\nThe Spanish words you will learn:\n• The Most Common Spanish Words - The most useful and most commonly used words are taught, so you can pick up the language as fast as possible.\n• Numbers - Learn to count to 100 million.\n• Verbs - Learn to conjugate verbs including past, future and present tenses(conjugation, the biggest part of Spanish grammar).\n• Sentences - Learn the most commonly used sentences and the sentences that are the building blocks to more complex sentences so you can start to build any sentence you want.\n• Grammar - Learn and practice grammar rules to get a deep understanding of the language.\n• Everything You Need - Everything is taught that you need to start speaking the Spanish.\n\nVocabulary Practice for All These Words:\nUsing flash card education, you can study the words you will need before the battle(audio is included).\n\nPronunciation:\nAudio - The words are included with audio and repeated as you battle, so you will very quickly pick up how to perfectly say the words.\n\nReading Practice:\nLanglandia includes 20+ books, half of them relating to the world of Langlandia. Don't know what the word means? Just click on it and it will be translated for you. You will be able to go to town and answer questions from the books you read in Spanish and if you answer correct, you may get a potion or a point to use on your beast. \n\nThousands of hours of gameplay:\nLanglandia is free and you can access all vocabulary in the game just by advancing through the game.\n\nAs you graduate grades in the institution:\nGet new words, books and sentences by taking your well trained beast and beating the teachers of the institution.\n\nGood for all levels of Spanish:\nIs your Spanish level high? Play the game on hard where the extremely quick battles will train your brain to understand words quickly. This is a necessary skill to be able to understand and speak (people won't slow down their speech just because you aren't a native speaker). All other Spanish levels are perfect for Langlandia.\n\nDifferent levels (Easy, Normal, Hard):\nYou can enjoy different levels of battles in Langlandia. Want some relaxed battles that aren't too difficult? Go for a walk in the meadow. Want something a little more challenging that you can collect more XP from? Go explore the forest. Are you feeling confident with the vocabulary and your beast? Enter the caves at hard difficulty for maximum XP.\n\nYou can play offline:\nYou can play offline as much as you want and all of your progress will automatically be saved.\n\nGood for all ages!\n\nTired of Spanish learning apps that are boring?  Download Langlandia now!\n_______________________________\n\nTerms & Conditions: https://opnations.wixsite.com/langlandia/terms-and-conditions\n\nSupport: langlandiagame@gmail.com"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "ENGINO is perhaps the only construction system that originated directly from Education. Originally inspired by teachers for the Design and Technology classroom, it evolved to an award winning product which covers from Structures to Mechanisms, Renewable energy and even Robotics Control.  The patented geometry of the ENGINO components allows connectivity to all directions of the 3D space with a simple snap-fit method, making it very easy even for children at the age of Primary Schools to build complex models. The 3D model viewer application has been created to allow easy access to new models developed by the ENGINO team and gradually the users themselves. All ENGINO sets have printed step by step instructions for the main models but many additional models can be created. With the new generation of technology where smart phones and tablets have become a part of every-day life, it is essential to enable the users to see new model ideas on these devices. The model viewer has an extensive library of models, continually updated, from cars to motorbikes, planes, helicopters, trucks, cranes and many more! The user can select which model to view and once this is loaded to the application, then the user can rotate the model to see it from various angles, he can zoom in to observe connecting details and most importantly he can explode the model and see how each part connects to the other one."

The Museum has placed more than 700 Bluetooth beacons throughout its 45 permanent halls. These tiny beacons give off signals that your phone can detect (when Bluetooth is enabled). Your phone calculates your position based on detecting three of these beacons simultaneously. This triangulation is not always perfect, especially in certain areas like large, multi-level halls, meandering walkways, or stairwells. Your phone should be able to detect the hall that you are in and provide turn-by-turn directions, but sometimes the “blue dot” is not exactly in the right place. In some rare cases it will even be missing. Moving to another area and waiting a few moments will usually fix the issue.\n\nThe Museum’s free AMNH-GUEST Wi-Fi also varies in strength throughout the complex. Certain materials and large exhibits (i.e. the Blue Whale) either absorb or reflect the radio signals used by Wi-Fi, further complicating this technology. If you experience difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi in a particular part of the Museum, you can usually fix the issue by moving a short distance away.\n \nWe’d Love to Hear From You!\nYour feedback is important and will help us improve your Museum experience.

      "label": "If you want to grow your leadership skills but don't have time to read every book or sift through endless blog posts, you're in the right place.\n\nBUNCH is an AI leadership coach that enables you to get 1% better every day in just 2 minutes a day. Curious? Here's what you need to know:\n\n****Leadership is a mindset, not a title****\nWhether you're leading yourself, a team, or an entire company, you have what it takes to be a great leader. Once you've got the mindset, you just need the tools. That's where BUNCH comes in!\n\n****Become the leader YOU want to be****\nNo two leaders are alike. That's why BUNCH uses psychology & AI to create a completely unique learning journey tailored for your leadership style, your role, and your interests - so you can build the skills that matter to you and your team.\n\n****Straight to the point with no fluff****\nEach day you'll get a bite-sized leadership tip that distills one key concept that's relevant for you, inspired & vetted by real-world leaders. They're designed to understood and remembered - like getting a summary of the best blog post you ever read.\n\n****Learn, act, reflect, repeat****\nTrue, stable growth comes from improving 1% every day. Get your tip, take action, and see how it goes. There is no try, only do!\n\n****Top 5 signs you should get BUNCH****\n=> You love to learn but don't have time to read every book or comb through every HBR article\n=> You want to empower those around you to do their best work but don’t know how\n=> You’re frustrated with your team: missed deadlines, re-work, slow progress\n=> You keep running into the same problems on project after project\n=> It feels like there’s always too much work and not enough time\n\nJoin a movement alongside 40,000+ other leaders. Here’s what they’re saying:\n\n\"After using BUNCH for a few months, I find it to be a helpful tool with constantly new and updated tips on leadership, it is eye opening for me in fields I have not explored before. I can recommend it to anyone responsible for a team's performance. Added bonus is that it comes with a community of leaders I can discuss related-topics with, and get specific advice.\" - Nader Alexan, CTO @ Airteam\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH user for months now, and there aren't many services that I'm this excited about! I genuinely believe it can be the lever to catapult your career or business - especially if you don't have time to read all the latest management books and HBR articles, but you still need to lead people in your work.\" - Srđan Stanić, Software Engineer at Gravitus\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH beta tester since the very beginning. Over the last year I've watched the app and the content grow into a truly meaningful product experience. Leaders at all levels can benefit from adopting the 2-minute daily habit. I love binging on tips in my free time, and often share content with my team.\" - Merissa Silk, Head of Product @ fundingport\n\n\"I almost dislike how popular BUNCH is becoming because as a beta user, it always felt like my own personal secret weapon! The coach makes it easy to have a moment of reflection each day, and having met the team behind it, I know they’re serious about their mission and vision to enable anyone to be a better leader.\" - Javier Gutiérrez Boronat, Agile Coach & Entrepreneurship Facilitator\n\n“Bunch gave me a template for how to call out team members who’ve gone above and beyond. The team loves it, and It’s really helped them gain a sense of what excellence looks like in their role.” - Cynthia Gordon, Customer Experience Leader @ [monday.com](http://monday.com/)\n\nReady to take the lead? Try it for a couple of weeks and let us know what you think!\n\n—\nData Protection: [https://www.bunch.ai/data-protection](https://www.bunch.ai/data-protection)\nTerms and Conditions: [https://www.bunch.ai/terms-conditions](https://www.bunch.ai/terms-conditions)"

Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words.

      "label": "\"3D Engineering Animations\" provides information, visualization and animations on 3D models, which can be downloaded within the app. A 3D interactive model helps to visualize working mechanisms from all sides. Models can be rotated, enlarged and panned. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\n1. Enable/disable 3D parts to see the parts which exactly you want to view.\r\n2. Information of each 3D models' parts and other mechanism available through Animation Dictation and Search Engine.\r\n3. Download 3D Models from Online Library and visualize them anytime. Some of the 3D Models in the Online Library:\r\n   a) V6 Engine (Automobile)\r\n   b) Arduino (Electronics)\r\n   c) Planetary Gearbox (Automobile)\r\n   d) Wind Turbine (Energy)\r\n   e) Car Suspension (Automobile)\r\n   f) Car Steering (Automobile)\r\n   g) Gear Transmission (Automobile)\r\n   h) Pneumatic Gripper (Hydraulics)\r\n   i) Stop Valve (Hydraulics)\r\n   j) Radial Engine (Aeronautics)\r\n   k) Watt Governor (Mechanical)\r\n   l) Differential System (Automobile)\r\n   m) Clutch Pad (Automobile)\r\n   n) Airbus (Visualization)\r\n   o) Planetary Gearbox (Automobile)\r\n   p) Lathe (Industrial), etc. (More content added every month)\r\n4. \"Animations + Dictation of information related to the model\" of 3D Models.\r\n5. Rotation, Pan and Scale Sensitivity of the 3d model can be controlled.\r\n6. Eagle's Eye Mode: Can see through the objects for skeletal view of an object.\r\n\r\nUsage and Navigation:\n1. Rotate the scene by dragging your finger over the model.\r\n2. Zoom the model in and out by pinching with your fingers.\r\n3. Pan the model by swiping two fingers over the model.\r\n4. Toggle check/uncheck the part to enable/disable them.\r\n5. Reset the camera to get the initial view of the model.\r\n6. Internet Connection is mandatory to download models. Downloaded models can be viewed in Offline Mode.\r\n\r\nNote: App is supported in 6 Languages(+ dictation):\r\n1. English\r\n2. Spanish\r\n3. Russian\r\n4. German\r\n5. Portuguese\r\n6. Japanese\r\n\r\nNote: A 3D Model size ranges from 2-5 MB. Otherwise, internet connection is required for TTS information which hardly takes 1 KB per session. So, only downloading models use up little data; visualizing pre-downloaded models take negligible data, if internet connected.\r\n\r\nThis is a must have app for students who are interested in learning/visualizing different structures in 3D animations."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

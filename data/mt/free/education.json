RANKED #1 APP FOR KIDS on APP Store in many countries. \n\nLet's come and play with me! \nThis new user-friendly wonderful Abby's Magic Laptop for Preschool and Toddlers welcomes you to the colorful world of exploration and learning! This adorable learn and play laptop teaches children letters, numbers, colors, shapes, animals, toys, fruits, musical instruments, and more. Kids will love switching between categories. Actions lead to learning!\n\nThe application offers you in total the possibility of choosing from 12(!) thematic categories. Children will be thrilled to play with this laptop and learn new things.  The numerous buttons the laptop offers invite exploration and enable children to determine their own pace of learning according to their individual needs.\n\nThe laptop includes two game modes: 'Let's Play!' and 'Let's Learn!' The switching between the modes is made easy by two large red buttons. Children typically do not experience problems learning to activate these two modes, but in case they do, we encourage parents to switch the mode\nfor their children.\n\n*Let's Play!*\nThe 'Let's Play!' mode is designed primarily for children unfamiliar with the objects included, or those who want to refresh and enhance their knowledge of the already acquired vocabulary. To activate the mode, simply press the 'Let's play!' button,  and choose a desired thematic category from one of the blue buttons in the upper half of the gaming space. For instance, after pressing a blue button with a picture of a ball, there are going to appear buttons with toys theme on the lower half of the gaming screen. When pressing the individual picture buttons then, the pictures are going to appear enlarged on the laptop monitor, the pronounced name and the written form of the word as well as its authentic sound and small animation follows afterwards.\n\n*Let's Learn!*\nDo you want some practice too? Don't forget to try the 'Let's Learn!' mode! To activate this mode, tap on the 'Let's Learn' button. Afterwards, choose one of the twelve thematic categories and let the challenge begin! When the category has been selected, an enthusiastic monkey Abby appears on the laptop monitor and gives tasks to a child. The task is always to select the picture of the correct item that she pronounced. Of course, after each correct answer, the cute monkey provides words of praise and\nencouragement.\n\nTo make the laptop more engaging, we also included four colorful buttons in the lower half of the game screen. These simulate the functions of a videophone and include such funny effects such as entertaining sound effects and melodies.\n\nThank you for selecting our app! We sincerely hope your children will enjoy it!\n\nYour 22learn team!"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Explorer is automatically set to the language of your device.\n \nMap and Turn-by-Turn Directions\nGet directions to exhibits and amenities, including shortest and accessible routes.\n \nGet Recommendations for What to See\nExplorer recommends exhibits based on interests you select—and sorts them by how close they are to your location.\n \nLearn More About the Museum’s Exhibits \nGo behind the scenes and dive deeper with videos, fun quizzes, and more.\n \nFind the Nearest Restroom \nExplorer provides you the shortest route to restrooms, shops, exits, and more.\n\nHow does Explorer know where you are? The Museum has placed more than 700 Bluetooth beacons throughout its 45 permanent halls. These tiny beacons give off signals that your phone can detect (when Bluetooth is enabled). Your phone calculates your position based on detecting three of these beacons simultaneously. This triangulation is not always perfect, especially in certain areas like large, multi-level halls, meandering walkways, or stairwells. Your phone should be able to detect the hall that you are in and provide turn-by-turn directions, but sometimes the “blue dot” is not exactly in the right place. In some rare cases it will even be missing. Moving to another area and waiting a few moments will usually fix the issue.\n\nThe Museum’s free AMNH-GUEST Wi-Fi also varies in strength throughout the complex. Certain materials and large exhibits (i.e. the Blue Whale) either absorb or reflect the radio signals used by Wi-Fi, further complicating this technology. If you experience difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi in a particular part of the Museum, you can usually fix the issue by moving a short distance away.\n \nWe’d Love to Hear From You!\nYour feedback is important and will help us improve your Museum experience.

      "label": "LearnEnglish Sounds Right is the British Council’s FREE pronunciation chart for learners and teachers of English worldwide.\n\nLEARNERS OF ENGLISH\nDo you have difficulty with the sounds and pronunciation of the English language, or with understanding the symbols of the phonemic alphabet? With LearnEnglish Sounds Right on your phone or tablet you can practise anywhere and anytime. Just tap a sound and you will hear it. Tap the downward arrow sign and listen to three example words with that sound.\n\nTEACHERS OF ENGLISH\nDo you use phonemic script in class to help your students with their pronunciation? With LearnEnglish Sounds Right installed on your class set of devices, or your students’ own devices, you can teach the individual sounds and symbols easily.\n\n* The pure vowels are arranged the same way as in the IPA chart: according to mouth shape (left to right, lips wide / round – top to bottom, jaw closed / open).\n\n* The diphthongs are grouped in rows according to their second sound.\n\n* The consonants are arranged from left (front of mouth) to right (back of mouth). The top two rows of consonants are paired (top row – unvoiced, second row – voiced). When you tap a plosive consonant, the schwa (ə) appears. This is because the plosives were recorded with a schwa for clarity.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using this chart!\n\nPlease contact us at learnenglish.mobile@britishcouncil.org if you have any comments or ideas for future versions.\n\nGet more great English learning apps from the British Council at:\nhttp://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/apps"

      "label": "eduroam is a global service for the academic community, facilitating access to internet connectivity when roaming. Find out more at https://www.eduroam.org\n \nThis eduroam Companion app has been created by Jisc, the UK’s national research and education network provider, to assist eduroam’s international community of users in making best use of the service. It documents the location of eduroam venues worldwide, allowing users to locate their nearest access location.\n \nUsers can use the map screen to explore eduroam venues close to them or to plan network access for upcoming trips. The interface allows searching for a specific venue or listing all venues on the current map view. Further details for each venue can be displayed, and if desired the app will create a route to navigate you to a chosen venue.\n \nPlease note that this companion app displays the data gathered by the central eduroam service, so any queries or requests for inclusion should in the first instance go to them   via the URL above. We’d be really grateful for any reviews or suggestions for the app itself, however.\n \nJisc is grateful for the assistance of Miro and colleagues in the Geant eduroam service management team in deploying core infrastructure to support this major update."

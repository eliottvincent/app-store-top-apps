Look through the eyes of your iPhone or iPad* to see a high-tech window into the whole visible universe.\n\nAll you have to do is point your AR enabled device* at the sky and Star Chart will tell you exactly what you are looking at.\n\nUsing state of the art GPS technology, an accurate 3D simulation of the visible universe, and a great deal of technical wizardry, Star Chart calculates – in real time - the current location of every star, planet and moon visible from Earth and shows you precisely where they are; even in broad daylight!\n\nWant to know what that bright star is called? Point your device* at it – you might just find out it’s a planet!\n\nWant to know what the night sky looks like to people on the other side of the earth? Well just point your device down!\n\nWant to know where your star sign is in the sky? Star Chart will tell you all this and more.\n\n\nStar Charts features include:\n- Just point and view. When you hold your device up to the sky, Star Chart will automatically start tracking your movements to match the sky *.\n\n- Alternatively, look around the sky using finger gestures – perfect for armchair astronomers!\n\n- In a single app of less than 30MB, Star Chart dynamically scales its visuals and capabilities across all iOS devices to meet the high end capabilities of a retina display iPad while also running smoothly on the earliest iPhones and iPods.\n\n- Accurately depicts all the visible stars of the northern and southern hemispheres - a total of approximately 120,000 stars!\n\n- Fly to and explore all the planets of the solar system, their moons and the sun all rendered in beautiful 3D with state of the art visual effects. \n\n- Using the powerful Time Shift feature, simply tap the time button and smoothly shift up to 10,000 years forward or backward in time.\n\n- Displays all 88 constellations, with constellation imagery based on the beautiful artwork by 17th century astronomer Johannes Hevelius.\n\n- Includes the complete Messier catalogue of 110 exotic deep sky objects.\n\n- Tap on anything in the sky and get the facts on what you are looking at, including distance and brightness.\n\n- Very powerful zoom function, lets you view the sky in extra detail, using intuitive finger gestures.\n\n- Fully configurable. Star Chart displays only the sky objects that you are interested in.\n\n- Allows you to view the sky underneath the horizon. So now you can see where the sun is, even at night!\n\n- Manually set your location to find out what the sky looks like from anywhere in the world.\n\n- Supports dynamic device orientation viewing. Allows you to view the night sky whilst holding your iPhone/iPad* at any angle.\n\nSo point your iPhone/iPad* at the sky and see what's out there!\n\n------------\n* Augmented Reality mode is available on devices that include a built-in compass. Manual scrolling is supported on all other devices.\n\n------------\nStar Chart is published by Escape Velocity Ltd and developed by Escapist Games Ltd.

However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words.

      "label": "The actress Sandra Hüller and many other voices guide you around the exhibitions at the JMB. The architect Daniel Libeskind talks about the ideas behind his design for the spectacular museum building. Personal stories and interviews, images, videos and games introduce you to the highlights and hidden gems of the exhibitions and provide a wide range of views of Jewish history and Jewish life today in Germany.\n\n\n\nThere is currently a choice of five tours on specific themes – What are the Museum Highlights? Discover 13 Lives, or find out more about 13 Objects. The tour What is …? provides answers to frequently asked questions about Judaism. The ensemble’s unique Architecture is also explored in a dedicated tour. But perhaps you prefer to find things out for yourself. Simply key in the numbers to make your own choice and decide on what to see next; an interactive map provides guidance. With audio instructions for available tactile experiences, inclusive audio descriptions of exhibits and transcripts of all audio contributions, the app permits a visit with virtually no accessibility problems.\n \n\n\nFeatures of the JMB App\n•\tMultimedia provision (audio, video, image & text) with more than 100 points of interest\n•\tNumber entry\n•\tGames and other interactive applications\n•\tInteractive map for your guidance \n•\tEntirely Screenreader-compatible\n•\tLanguages: German, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian and Hebrew\n\n\nNote\nIf you wish to use the JMB app, we recommend you opt for headphones and stream the data in the exhibition to avoid waiting for content to download. To ensure a smooth performance, iOS version 13.x or higher is recommended.\n\nIn case of technical problems, to make a suggestion or a critical comment, please get in touch with visit@berlin.de and include information about your device and operating system. We look forward to receiving your feedback!"

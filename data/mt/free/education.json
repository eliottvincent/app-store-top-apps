      "label": "Brainscape’s SMART FLASHCARDS foster hyper-efficient studying and strong habits to DOUBLE your learning speed, with the strongest implementation of spaced repetition and active recall of any flashcard app on the planet! (And probably in the universe, assuming some super intelligent alien species out there hasn’t beaten us to it.)\n\nWith a knowledge bank created by millions of global users and experts, you can FIND, MAKE, and SHARE flashcards anytime, anywhere, and on any device, while keeping all your content meticulously ORGANIZED and seamlessly IN SYNC across web, mobile, and all your devices.\n\nHow does it work? Brainscape’s intelligent study system has been designed in accordance with decades of proven cognitive science to help you learn faster and remember longer than with any other flashcard app. (And we don’t waste time on games. Our flashcards are for serious learners.)\n\nBrainscape distills any subject down into bite-sized facts (neatly organized into decks and classes), which are posed as question-and-answer pairs, compelling you to actively recall information from scratch. You then rate how well you know each concept on a scale of 1 to 5, and Brainscape determines the perfect time interval at which to repeat that flashcard again. \n\nIf you know the answer well, you’ll see that flashcard less often; if you don’t know it well, you’ll see it again and again, at frequent intervals, until it’s deeply ingrained into your brain. And it’s this totally unique combination of active recall, self-assessment (metacognition), and spaced repetition that is scientifically proven to significantly slash your required study time!\n\nWhere do all of Brainscape’s awesome flashcards come from? Three places:\n\nTHE WORLD’S TOP EXPERTS. Brainscape partners with top publishers, schools, and educators to create comprehensive collections of certified flashcards for a diverse array of subjects, from foreign languages (we are the best language-learning tool in the world) to high-stakes exams like the AP series, MBE (bar exam), Series 7, NCLEX, MCAT, and more.\n\nYOUR PEERS. Top students, professors, teachers, tutorpreneurs, and businesses around the world have created over 1 million subjects that are available to search on Brainscape’s Knowledge Genome.\n\nYOU! You can easily create and organize thousands of multimedia flashcards featuring text, images, and even audio files, both on Brainscape’s website AND within the app itself. You can also share your decks with your classmates and collaboratively develop content together. \n\nHow much does it cost? Creating and sharing great flashcards is FREE. (Woohoo!) And for unlimited access to ALL of Brainscape's user-generated and premium, expert-curated content, as well as optional features, like bookmarks and card reversibility, you can upgrade to Pro for $19.99 (monthly), $59.99 (every 6 months), or $95.99 (annually). Alternatively, you can unlock a LIFETIME of learning with Brainscape for a one-time cost of only $199.99 American dolla billz.\n \nThe fine print: The three recurring subscriptions (monthly, semiannual, and annual) will renew automatically within 24 hours before the end of the current period, unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the period. You can cancel auto-renewal any time by going to Account Settings, and the cancellation will apply after the active subscription period is complete. Go ahead and learn more about our Terms and Privacy Policy at brainscape.com/terms.\n\nWhat’s on the horizon? It’s our vision to empower everyone, everywhere to rise to the challenge of personalized forever-learning. And for this reason, we love hearing from our community of users: it’s through your feedback that we can continue to innovate our learning platform to be more convenient, efficient, and even fun and social to use!"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

The most powerful you can do is become who you came here to be, and unbecome the way you've been taught to be. Human Design is a new science that gives you your unique roadmap to becoming that real version of self and from there, everything flows. There is a reason why following other people's plans and advice doesn't 100% work for you - because you were designed differently than them.

      "label": "Vroom! Vroom! The truck engine starts! The new season of the Wheel Cup Competition has begun! Dear little race car drivers, jump into your favorite monster truck and join the battle for the championship!\n\n3 themed maps and 18 uniquely shaped levels\n\nListen! Hear the gears turning and the machines roaring.\nWelcome to the abandoned assembly factory! There are steel frames that may collapse at any time, conveyor belts that block your movement, and piles of industrial raw materials that have been there for years. There’s also said to be a big-faced cat lurking about, and it will catch you if it sees you!\n\nWatch out! See the flickering lights and the swinging magic mining picks.\nThis is the lava mine that was left deserted several years ago. You’ll see rubies scattered throughout the lava. There are rugged and bizarre railroad tracks that crisscross the mine. Make sure you step on the gas pedal to break through the piles of rocks ahead!\n\nAha! Feel the scorching summer sun and cooling sea breeze on your body.\nWe are now arriving at the scenic seaside town. Here you will find temples of ancient civilizations, and mystery relics that nobody has ever stepped on. You can even discover the treasures left by the one-eyed old captain. But beware, a giant Monster Octopus is watching carefully. If it gets angry, it will stir up stormy waves with its long tentacles.\n\n3 legendary Boss battles are waiting for you\nDo ordinary opponents no longer pose a threat to you? Try the challenge of the hidden maps and obtain trucks from the legendary Boss. Whether it is the Giant Excavator in the assembly factory, the Sleeping Fiery Dragon in the lava mine, or the Monster Octopus at the seaside town, they are all first-class masters. They are gearing up and waiting for new challengers! Are you confident you can beat them?\n\n12 cool monster trucks to upgrade and modify\n\nChoose freely from 12 totally different vehicles! The blue heavy truck, the exclusive shark truck, and more! Tap to select your favorite one to take part in the competition! Feel like your car is not fast enough? Hurry to use the gold coins obtained in the races and give your car a top-to-bottom tune-up. Shock absorber springs with better performance, tires with higher grip, and engines with more horsepower—these custom modifications will all help move you a step ahead of everyone else!\n\nGain useful boosters to move forward\n\nCollect gold coins to upgrade your monster trucks. Press the emit button to prevent opponents from advancing, gain shields to defend against attacks, and collect energy to keep accelerating. The more boosters you've got, the more chances you have to win!\n\nKey Features\n• 3 themed maps: abandoned assembly factory, deserted lava mine, and scenic seaside town\n• 12 cool, different shaped monster trucks\n• Upgrade monster trucks with multiple combinations and variations\n• Enhanced race experience with optimized AI opponents \n• Advanced booster system: Attack, Acceleration, and Defense\n• Brand new roadblocks and route designs\n• No internet needed to play\n• No third-party advertising\n\nAbout Yateland\nYateland crafts apps with educational value, inspiring preschoolers across the globe to learn through play!

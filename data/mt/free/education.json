From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Features:\n\n- designed for mariners, travellers, yachtsmen, pleasure cruisers and anyone who enjoys spending time around the waterfront.\n- 104 levels and 35 challenges teaching and training maritime flag signalling and the International Code of Signals (ICS).\n- 6 chapters including Letters, Numbers, Words, Substitutes, Single Flag Meanings and Abbreviations.\n- effective and fun teaching and training strategy: learn and train first with ease and then challenge yourself with pressure.\n- calculated amount of repetition for smooth and efficient memorization and progress.\n- explore all the letters, numbers, substitutes and abbreviations at your own pace on the Explore screen.\n- info screen offering detailed explanation of how to make the most of the app.\n- absolutely no ads.\n- works completely offline.\n\n--------\n\nAbout Maritime Academy\n\nThe app teaches maritime flag signalling (generally flaghoist signalling), which is the principal means other than radio by which ships communicate to each other or to shore.\n\nVirtually all signalling by non-naval vessels is now organized under the International Code of Signals (whether by flaghoist, semaphore, signal lamp, or other means), which specifies a standard set of flags and codes and is the most recent evolution of a wide variety of maritime flag signalling systems. Naval vessels generally use an extended set of flags and their own codes.\n\n--------\n\nTeaching method\n\nThe two key teaching and training concepts are progressive introduction and focused repetition. The learning material is categorized into chapters and then broken down into manageable units (levels) to ensure efficient learning and training.\n\n--------\n\nLearning material\n\nIn general, the learning progresses from single-flag content to multi-flag content. That is to say, from letters & numbers to words & substitutes, and then to single flag meanings & abbreviations. The content is arranged for optimal efficiency and we strongly recommend you to go through the levels in this order.\n\n- Letters (8 levels + 4 challenges)\n- Numbers (3 levels + 1 challenge)\n- Words (30 levels)\n- Substitutes (1 level)\n- Single Flag Meanings (8 levels + 4 challenges)\n- Abbreviations (54 levels + 26 challenges)\n\n--------\n\nLevels and challenges\n\nIn short, a level focuses on introducing and training new letters/numbers/abbreviations, while a challenge tests what you’ve learnt. In the learning screen, the knowledge you should focus on is highlighted and in the training screen, you will practice by answering a few questions (like a quiz game). In a challenge, you must make less than 3 mistakes to pass it.\n\n--------\n\nTraining types\n\nThere are three training types, that is to say, key, typing and button.\n\n- In Letters & Numbers levels, you need to press the keys of the keyboard on the screen to answer the questions.\n- In Words & Substitutes levels, you need to type whole words to answer the questions.\n- In Single Flag Meanings & Abbreviations levels, you need to choose the correct meaning by clicking on a button.\n\n--------\n\nThe Explore screen\n\nThe Explore screen allows users to check out the International Flags and Pennants of the 26 letters of the English Alphabet, numbers (0-9), substitutes (3), as well as the International Code of Signals including 25 single flag meanings and 201 most frequently used abbreviations. Simply click on the blocks to start exploring.\n\n--------\n\nDownload Maritime Academy now and start learning the signal flags!\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.dong.digital/maritimeacademy/privacy/\nTerms of Use: https://www.dong.digital/maritimeacademy/tos/"

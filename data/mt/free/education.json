Get a map, turn-by-turn directions to exhibits and amenities, customized recommendations for what to see, and more! \n \n“A great aid to anyone seeing the museum for the first or 40th time.” - The New York Times\n \nAvailable in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Explorer is automatically set to the language of your device.\n \nMap and Turn-by-Turn Directions\nGet directions to exhibits and amenities, including shortest and accessible routes.\n \nGet Recommendations for What to See\nExplorer recommends exhibits based on interests you select—and sorts them by how close they are to your location.\n \nLearn More About the Museum’s Exhibits \nGo behind the scenes and dive deeper with videos, fun quizzes, and more.\n \nFind the Nearest Restroom \nExplorer provides you the shortest route to restrooms, shops, exits, and more.\n\nHow does Explorer know where you are? The Museum has placed more than 700 Bluetooth beacons throughout its 45 permanent halls. These tiny beacons give off signals that your phone can detect (when Bluetooth is enabled). Your phone calculates your position based on detecting three of these beacons simultaneously. This triangulation is not always perfect, especially in certain areas like large, multi-level halls, meandering walkways, or stairwells. Your phone should be able to detect the hall that you are in and provide turn-by-turn directions, but sometimes the “blue dot” is not exactly in the right place. In some rare cases it will even be missing. Moving to another area and waiting a few moments will usually fix the issue.\n\nThe Museum’s free AMNH-GUEST Wi-Fi also varies in strength throughout the complex. Certain materials and large exhibits (i.e. the Blue Whale) either absorb or reflect the radio signals used by Wi-Fi, further complicating this technology. If you experience difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi in a particular part of the Museum, you can usually fix the issue by moving a short distance away.\n \nWe’d Love to Hear From You!\nYour feedback is important and will help us improve your Museum experience.

Features you'll find on the app includes text-to-speech, pdf-to-speech, web content to speech and image to speech by scanning documents. It uses a narrator’s voice to dictate the content that it’s been given to read aloud. \n\nThe non-premium (free) version of VIIO makes use of a normal voice generator, while it’s premium version has a natural-reader for a better experience. We have a variety of features that help differentiate us from a normal text-to-speech (TTS)  app, read-to-me app, scan to read app, speak-for-me app, book-reader app or text reader. \n\nVIIO can be used to read text copied from other note taking apps like Evernote, Notability, goodnotes, oneNote and oneDrive. If the text can’t be copied like in the case of apps like Scribd and Goodreads, you can use a screenshot to get the text and pass it to the app. VIIO also lets you convert any documents, PDF, web content and images of text into some sort of audiobook. \n\nVIIO is very helpful to those suffering from reading disabilities such as Dyslexia, ADHD and Anxiety\n\nTerms of Use - https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

The interface allows searching for a specific venue or listing all venues on the current map view. Further details for each venue can be displayed, and if desired the app will create a route to navigate you to a chosen venue.\n \nPlease note that this companion app displays the data gathered by the central eduroam service, so any queries or requests for inclusion should in the first instance go to them   via the URL above.

Parallel - Live SIMULATES live feeds and provides a gamified learning experience to improve speech and engagement.\n\nFor managers of influencers and professors of communication, you may have your students record their speaking session. They can be sent to you for further analysis along with our report. This makes learning fun while feeling clout, fame, or hype associated with engaged simulated live environments. \n\nThe environment is completely controlled and does not require internet to use. We are not affiliated with any other social media platforms. We are an educational game aimed at improving your ability to speak."

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

These two theorems are not rationalistic when we see Geetha as the base.  Dvaitha Theorem is as true as the statement “there is a tree on the earth without the roots” and Advaitha Theorem is as true as the statement “there is a tree without the earth and roots.  So, we can easily determine that these two theorems are unscientific and irrational as per Bhagavad Geetha-Purushottama Prapti Yoga, 16, 17 verses.  \n\n     These two verses are condemning both the Advaitha and Dvaitha Theorems in a single blow.  These two verses teaching us the real divine theorem called “The Thraitha Theorem”. Not only those two verses but the entire notion of BhagavadGeetha is fully dependent on “The Thraitha Theorem” only.  \n       \n      Dvaitha and Advaitha Theorems came out recently in Kaliyuga, whereas The “Thraitha Theorem” got revealed by Bhagavan Sri Krishna [Messenger of GOD] in the end of DwaparaYuga itself.  But because of Maya [Ignorance], it was not understood till now.  Also Dvaitha and advaitha Theorems came out because of Maya only.  Even today we are seeing the “Peethas” of Dvaitha and Advaitha Theorems. \n\n       But unfortunately no where we are listening the name “Thraitham” or we are not seeing anyone who is preaching Thraitham.  \n\n   Our true Guru, Sri Sri Sri Acharya Prabodhananda Yogeeswarulu, originated the “Thraitha Siddhantham” for us.\n\n    “Thraitha Theorem” means the theorem of three souls, they are 1. Jeevatma [Mortal soul], 2. Atma [Immortal Soul], 3. Paramatma [Absolute Soul]. Bhagavad Geetha exists according to “Thraitham” and “Thraitham” exists according to Bhagavad Geetha. These two are inseparable pair. \n\n    The three lines that exists on a human palm, the three lines that exists on Eeswara Lingam are representing Thraitham only.  \n\n     This Thraitha Siddhantha Bhagavad Geetha reveals us the great Divine Theorem called “Thraitha Theorem”. By reading this “Thraitha Siddhantha Bhagavad Geetha”, one can gain the real notion of “Bhagavan Sri Krishna” and will find the path to attain the Liberation."

RANKED #1 APP FOR KIDS on APP Store in many countries. \n\nLet's come and play with me! \nThis new user-friendly wonderful Abby's Magic Laptop for Preschool and Toddlers welcomes you to the colorful world of exploration and learning! This adorable learn and play laptop teaches children letters, numbers, colors, shapes, animals, toys, fruits, musical instruments, and more. Kids will love switching between categories. Actions lead to learning!\n\nThe application offers you in total the possibility of choosing from 12(!) thematic categories. Children will be thrilled to play with this laptop and learn new things.  The numerous buttons the laptop offers invite exploration and enable children to determine their own pace of learning according to their individual needs.\n\nThe laptop includes two game modes: 'Let's Play!' and 'Let's Learn!' The switching between the modes is made easy by two large red buttons. Children typically do not experience problems learning to activate these two modes, but in case they do, we encourage parents to switch the mode\nfor their children.\n\n*Let's Play!*\nThe 'Let's Play!' mode is designed primarily for children unfamiliar with the objects included, or those who want to refresh and enhance their knowledge of the already acquired vocabulary. To activate the mode, simply press the 'Let's play!' button,  and choose a desired thematic category from one of the blue buttons in the upper half of the gaming space. For instance, after pressing a blue button with a picture of a ball, there are going to appear buttons with toys theme on the lower half of the gaming screen. When pressing the individual picture buttons then, the pictures are going to appear enlarged on the laptop monitor, the pronounced name and the written form of the word as well as its authentic sound and small animation follows afterwards.\n\n*Let's Learn!*\nDo you want some practice too? Don't forget to try the 'Let's Learn!' mode! To activate this mode, tap on the 'Let's Learn' button. Afterwards, choose one of the twelve thematic categories and let the challenge begin! When the category has been selected, an enthusiastic monkey Abby appears on the laptop monitor and gives tasks to a child. The task is always to select the picture of the correct item that she pronounced. Of course, after each correct answer, the cute monkey provides words of praise and\nencouragement.\n\nTo make the laptop more engaging, we also included four colorful buttons in the lower half of the game screen. These simulate the functions of a videophone and include such funny effects such as entertaining sound effects and melodies.\n\nThank you for selecting our app! We sincerely hope your children will enjoy it!\n\nYour 22learn team!"

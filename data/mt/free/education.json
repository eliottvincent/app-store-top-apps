Download today so you can watch Robert and his team of hand-picked advisors as they help you not only survive, but thrive, in this current economy.  Through these exclusive videos you’ll learn how to apply the Rich Dad philosophy in your own personal life and can begin building your own wealth and success.\n \nAbout Rich Dad:\nThe philosophy of Rich Dad was built from a simple lesson learned by Robert Kiyosaki at an early age. He had two dads – one rich and one poor.\nRobert's poor dad, his natural father, was highly educated, the head of the Hawaiian school system, and enjoyed a decent salary. Yet, he constantly complained about having being broke and continually said, \"I can't afford it.\"\nRobert's rich dad, his best friend's father, was a high-school dropout building a business. He wasn’t wealthy. Yet, he constantly enjoyed the finer things in life and always asked, \"How can I afford it?\"\nThe contrast between Robert's two dads taught him a great lesson. Robert realized his poor dad's outlook suppressed his dreams and closed his mind to the possibility of financial freedom. He died penniless and full of regret.\nHis rich dad's outlook elevated his dreams and opened his mind to life's possibilities. He achieved great wealth, financial freedom, and enjoyed life to the fullest.\nBoth were good and highly capable men. But only one lived richly.\nThroughout his life, Robert's rich dad taught him many valuable, financial lessons. Sometimes Robert listened. Sometimes he had to learn the hard way. But by applying these lessons, Robert became financially free and retired.\nHowever, Robert wasn't content with retirement. Fueled by the passion to share his financial wisdom with others, Robert created his board game, CASHFLOW®, based on his belief that people learn best through simulation. Robert Kiyosaki is also the author of the #1 personal finance book of all time, Rich Dad Poor Dad. Through his teachings you can get on the right path to becoming financially free. Now, through this app you can watch him as he travels around the World spreading his knowledge of financial literacy.\n\nWhat you get:\nIn the Fall of 2008, Robert and his team held a special 3-day live event in Scottsdale, Arizona entitled How To Predict The Future. This intense, sold-out educational event brought together students and experts from around the world. At the event, the team of presenters covered information including:\nHow to predict the future by learning from past cycles and events\nThe importance of the Mandrake Mechanism of money creation and how to benefit from it\nHow to design your future using the PERT technique\nWe’ve included over 4 hours of highlight footage from the event that will reveal strategies you can apply to predict the future and transform your life.\nWarning: This footage may contain adult language. Viewer discretion is advised.\nYou will also get:\n·       Access to video from Robert and his team of advisors.\n·       Access to video Replays of Rich Dad Live Stream events\n·       SPECIAL BONUS:   A FREE Introduction to Rich Dad Coaching so you can work with one of Roberts hand-picked Coaches to increase your monthly income!

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain.

To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy.

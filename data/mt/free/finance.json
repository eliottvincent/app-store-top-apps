This is a one time process since once you enrol one card all your Bank of Valletta cards, that may be used for online purchases will be automatically enrolled to the 3D Secure app.\nDuring the enrolment process you will set an authentication passcode that will be used to authenticate you online purchases via the app - alternatively you can choose to set up biometric authentication by means of fingerprint, if your device supports the feature.  \n\nOnce the one-time enrolment process is complete, you are set to start shopping online:\n\nWhen checking out purchases over a certain amount, at certain merchants, the payment screen will ask you to authenticate the purchase;  \nSimultaneously you will receive a push notification on your smart device which will prompt you to access the BOV 3D Secure app to authenticate the transaction either by passcode (established during enrollment) or biometrically, by means of your fingerprint. \nThe app will then advise that authentication is successful and you will be able to tap the \"proceed\" button on the payment screen to complete your purchase.\nIf you are in an area of no reception, or your device is not connected to an internet/data service, the payment screen will prompt you to scan a QR Code which will automatically launch the BOV 3D Secure app on your phone and following authentication a 6 digit code will be displayed. This code is to be inserted in the designated field on the payment screen. Following that simply tap the \"proceed\" button on the payment screen to complete your purchase.\n\nImportant information\nBank of Valletta will not contact you because you are using the app. So please stay alert to emails, text messages or phone calls that appear to be from us. Criminals may try to trick you into giving them sensitive personal or account information.  Any suspicious communications or transactions should always be reported to Bank of Valletta immediately by calling the number on the reverse of your card, thus enabling immediate remedial action to be taken as necessary."

Oversee and manage each of your employee cards and freeze and unfreeze at a tap of the screen - all from your wamo dashboard. \n \nMultiple payments \nWe’ve made payments as easy as you’ve always thought they should be. No hardware needed. \n \nGet paid or pay via payment links, QR codes, regular transfers or through free wamo-to-wamo in-app payments (think peer-to-peer payments but for business, hooray!).

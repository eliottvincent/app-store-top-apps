      "label": "None of the usual business bank account limits apply.\nFor businesses of all sizes - from freelancers to start-ups, to SMEs and corporations - wamo makes it easy to manage every aspect of your business finances from one place. \n\nLimitless accounts \nOpen your wamo business account in minutes and create as many sub-accounts as you like. It’s the best way to streamline your finances. Use sub-accounts to manage and budget for your teams, projects and business expenses. Each sub-account can be connected to a physical and/or virtual Visa debit card issued and managed by you. \n \nChoose between GBP and Euros, exchange currencies between sub-accounts and send and receive money when you want with SEPA and Swift. \n \nFlexible cards \nIssue as many Visa debit cards as you and your team need. Use visual cards for speed and security and physical cards for carrying and withdrawals. \n \nThe poor, over-used single business card that gets passed around the office, can go OOO for good. Oversee and manage each of your employee cards and freeze and unfreeze at a tap of the screen - all from your wamo dashboard. \n \nMultiple payments \nWe’ve made payments as easy as you’ve always thought they should be. No hardware needed. \n \nGet paid or pay via payment links, QR codes, regular transfers or through free wamo-to-wamo in-app payments (think peer-to-peer payments but for business, hooray!). Wherever your customer is and however they want to pay, wamo makes it possible. Never be limited by the kinds of payments you can accept ever again. \n \nComing soon: Future and recurring payments and oversee all incoming and outgoings from your wamo dashboard. \n \nQR tech \nYou can take payments instantly by having your customer scan the QR code on your phone that comes with your wamo business account. But with wamo, you don’t even need a phone to take a payment - wamo QR stickers can be placed anywhere for your customers to simply scan and pay, instantly. \n \nPlace your digital QR code on your website or on your social media posts to make it easy for your customers to scan and pay online. \n \nNo cards, no cash, no machines, no integrating payment systems. Just money in your account, instantly. \n \nDo what you love and let wamo take care of the rest."

      "label": "The future is web3. The now of web3…well that’s not always so friendly. This is especially true with the current web3/crypto wallet experience. It doesn’t feel very personal or helpful. It can be clumsy, frustrating, and it doesn’t always feel safe figuring it out on your own. \n \nWelcome to Easy. We are reimagining the wallet because we believe that web3 can be easier, safer and more fun if we all go it together. With a focus on community, we created the first web3 social wallet. We asked ourselves, what if our wallet was built for people, not protocols? What if our wallet shared our excitement for web3 discovery and enabled exploration? What if our wallet proactively helped keep us safe? What if we could reduce the need for multiple wallets with a single wallet that works across blockchains? And what if it was so thoughtfully designed and intuitively easy that we would love using it?\n\nWe believe a wallet can be all that, and more. And since we couldn’t find one that was all of the above, we built our own. Easy, the social wallet for you, your friends and communities.\n\nNow that you know the origin story, here are some of Easy's super powers:\n\n- Easy is a social experience. We help you explore web3 by connecting you with your friends and the communities you love. \n- Easy promotes discovery with a highly personalized feed based on real-time blockchain activity that keeps you looped in on what’s dropping, who’s aping in, and how floor prices are moving.\n- Easy features a community-sourced rating system, called Signal, that protects you from scams and other risks that are all-too-common in web3. Signal is there for you right at the moment of transaction, when you need it most. \n- Easy is a multi-chain wallet, currently supporting Ethereum and Polygon, with more chains to come soon. \n- And Easy lets you create your own beautifully-designed profile featuring an easily curated Showcase and Mosaic Gallery of your favorite NFTs.\n\nTo be honest, Easy is much more than a wallet – we’re  your web3 backpack. Plenty of space for everything about web3 that excites you. Organize it, show it off to friends and carry it around with you wherever you go. \n\nGet ready for the first wallet you’re going to love. Download Easy and let’s discover web3 together."

Selbstverständlich können Sie auch die klassische Variante mit Eingabe der IBAN für Ihre Überweisung nutzen. \nSie verwenden für die Überweisungen Ihre selbst festgelegte Fidor Freigabe PIN.\n\nMit Sicherheit ein gutes Gefühl\n\nDie Fidor Smart Banking App nutzt zu Ihrer Sicherheit das sogenannte „Device Binding“. Das bedeutet, dass Sie Ihre mobilen Bankgeschäfte nur über ein einzelnes mobiles Endgerät durchführen können. So ist sichergestellt, dass niemand auf einem zweiten Gerät Zugang zu Ihrer Fidor Smart Banking App erlangt. \nAußerdem benötigen Sie Ihre Email-Adresse und Ihr Passwort, um sich in die App einzuloggen.\nSie selbst legen fest, wie lange Sie eingeloggt bleiben möchten (Auswahl im App-Menü). Standardmäßig ist ein Timeout von einer Minute eingestellt. Das heißt, dass Sie eine Minute lang eingeloggt bleiben und danach Ihre Zugangsdaten erneut eingeben müssen.\n\nIhre Kontobewegungen immer im Blick\n\nDie App informiert Sie auf Wunsch über Kontobewegungen, Kartenaktivitäten, Überweisungen & Daueraufträgen mit Push-Benachrichtigungen. Sie erhalten in der App die Information darüber, welche Aktivität auf Ihrem Fidor Smart Girokonto bzw. Ihrem Fidor Smart Geschäftskonto stattgefunden hat.\n\n\nHaben Sie Fragen zum Banking?

Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

This is a one time process since once you enrol one card all your Bank of Valletta cards, that may be used for online purchases will be automatically enrolled to the 3D Secure app.\nDuring the enrolment process you will set an authentication passcode that will be used to authenticate you online purchases via the app - alternatively you can choose to set up biometric authentication by means of fingerprint, if your device supports the feature.  \n\nOnce the one-time enrolment process is complete, you are set to start shopping online:\n\nWhen checking out purchases over a certain amount, at certain merchants, the payment screen will ask you to authenticate the purchase;  \nSimultaneously you will receive a push notification on your smart device which will prompt you to access the BOV 3D Secure app to authenticate the transaction either by passcode (established during enrollment) or biometrically, by means of your fingerprint. \nThe app will then advise that authentication is successful and you will be able to tap the \"proceed\" button on the payment screen to complete your purchase.\nIf you are in an area of no reception, or your device is not connected to an internet/data service, the payment screen will prompt you to scan a QR Code which will automatically launch the BOV 3D Secure app on your phone and following authentication a 6 digit code will be displayed. This code is to be inserted in the designated field on the payment screen. Following that simply tap the \"proceed\" button on the payment screen to complete your purchase.\n\nImportant information\nBank of Valletta will not contact you because you are using the app. So please stay alert to emails, text messages or phone calls that appear to be from us. Criminals may try to trick you into giving them sensitive personal or account information.  Any suspicious communications or transactions should always be reported to Bank of Valletta immediately by calling the number on the reverse of your card, thus enabling immediate remedial action to be taken as necessary."

      "label": "The Bitcoin.com Wallet, trusted by millions, is an easy-to-use, multichain, self-custodial crypto wallet that puts you in full control of all your crypto holdings.\n\nIt allows you to:\n\n- Buy Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), and select ERC-20 tokens quickly and easily via credit card, Apple Pay, and more.\n- Sell BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, and select ERC-20 tokens into your local currency (in select regions).\n- Send, receive, and swap between BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, USDT, USDC, and a huge range of ERC-20 tokens.\n- Access DeFi apps that enable use cases like earning interest on your crypto, borrowing and lending, participating in NFT marketplaces, synthetic assets, and more.\n\nOther key features include:\n\nSELF-CUSTODIAL\n\nYour cryptoassets are ultra-secure because only you can access them. Self-custodial means not even Bitcoin.com has access to your funds, and you can easily port your assets to another crypto wallet whenever you want. No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password. Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

It’s the best way to streamline your finances. Use sub-accounts to manage and budget for your teams, projects and business expenses. Each sub-account can be connected to a physical and/or virtual Visa debit card issued and managed by you. \n \nChoose between GBP and Euros, exchange currencies between sub-accounts and send and receive money when you want with SEPA and Swift. \n \nFlexible cards \nIssue as many Visa debit cards as you and your team need. Use visual cards for speed and security and physical cards for carrying and withdrawals. \n \nThe poor, over-used single business card that gets passed around the office, can go OOO for good. Oversee and manage each of your employee cards and freeze and unfreeze at a tap of the screen - all from your wamo dashboard. \n \nMultiple payments \nWe’ve made payments as easy as you’ve always thought they should be. No hardware needed. \n \nGet paid or pay via payment links, QR codes, regular transfers or through free wamo-to-wamo in-app payments (think peer-to-peer payments but for business, hooray!). Wherever your customer is and however they want to pay, wamo makes it possible. Never be limited by the kinds of payments you can accept ever again. \n \nComing soon: Future and recurring payments and oversee all incoming and outgoings from your wamo dashboard. \n \nQR tech \nYou can take payments instantly by having your customer scan the QR code on your phone that comes with your wamo business account. But with wamo, you don’t even need a phone to take a payment - wamo QR stickers can be placed anywhere for your customers to simply scan and pay, instantly. \n \nPlace your digital QR code on your website or on your social media posts to make it easy for your customers to scan and pay online. \n \nNo cards, no cash, no machines, no integrating payment systems. Just money in your account, instantly. \n \nDo what you love and let wamo take care of the rest. \n\nWe do contactless menu too!\nWho said QR code menus are clunky by nature? Not us! Get the zippiest, smartest contactless menu into your establishment now. What makes our contactless menu different? Customers can order, tip and pay from the same place and from the comfort of their phones. It’s completely brilliant! Want to increase your table spend by 22%, tips by 40%, and save 15 minutes per table? Contact us to book a menu tour."

Tricount's terms and conditions are available at https://tricount.com/en/terms\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\ncreate a tricount, share your link with friends ... et voilà!\n\nTricount makes sorting out and divvying your group expenses very easy when you organize activities (for example: ski trip, citytrip, holidays with a classroom, flatmates etc.)\n\nGone are the days of the old excel file: an easier and effective solution exists to breakdown the costs, sharing expense reports, list tickets and spending. Tricount does the accounting and balances the cost for your group expenses.\n\nIt lets you breakdown the budget of a group and track expenses during a trip or any occasion with friends. It can be used by couples, between colleagues, roommates & flatmates. It is a simple yet powerful tool to figure out who owes what to whom and balance spendings : I owe you, you owe me (IOU) ... so easy!\n\nCreate your group expenses on your mobile (even offline), during your group activity. Send everyone the link (a la Doodle), and your friends too can add their own expense or see your changes.\n\nTricount then tells you who should pay what to whom to balance the group.\n\nVery useful for any activity with friends and colleagues: holiday, city-trip, flat sharing & flatmates, week-ends, everyday lunch with colleagues, parties, etc. In your couple, you can create a tricount to know who has paid what this month, or on holiday.\nThe app exists for most mobile devices, and on the web! All currencies are accepted, even bitcoins if you want."

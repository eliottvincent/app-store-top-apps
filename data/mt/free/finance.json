It’s the best way to streamline your finances. Use sub-accounts to manage and budget for your teams, projects and business expenses. Each sub-account can be connected to a physical and/or virtual Visa debit card issued and managed by you. \n \nChoose between GBP and Euros, exchange currencies between sub-accounts and send and receive money when you want with SEPA and Swift. \n \nFlexible cards \nIssue as many Visa debit cards as you and your team need. Use visual cards for speed and security and physical cards for carrying and withdrawals. \n \nThe poor, over-used single business card that gets passed around the office, can go OOO for good. Oversee and manage each of your employee cards and freeze and unfreeze at a tap of the screen - all from your wamo dashboard. \n \nMultiple payments \nWe’ve made payments as easy as you’ve always thought they should be. No hardware needed. \n \nGet paid or pay via payment links, QR codes, regular transfers or through free wamo-to-wamo in-app payments (think peer-to-peer payments but for business, hooray!). Wherever your customer is and however they want to pay, wamo makes it possible. Never be limited by the kinds of payments you can accept ever again. \n \nComing soon: Future and recurring payments and oversee all incoming and outgoings from your wamo dashboard. \n \nQR tech \nYou can take payments instantly by having your customer scan the QR code on your phone that comes with your wamo business account. But with wamo, you don’t even need a phone to take a payment - wamo QR stickers can be placed anywhere for your customers to simply scan and pay, instantly. \n \nPlace your digital QR code on your website or on your social media posts to make it easy for your customers to scan and pay online. \n \nNo cards, no cash, no machines, no integrating payment systems. Just money in your account, instantly. \n \nDo what you love and let wamo take care of the rest."

When banking online, use pushTAN, an advanced, mobile security procedure.\n\nIT'S THAT EASY\n• When banking online with iPhone, iPad or computer, place your payment orders and send them.\n• The S-pushTAN app always shows the details of the order. Just check the order data and release the order by swiping.\n• Usable for all orders with TAN release. Whether transfers, submitting or changing standing orders, securitie or service orders and much more.\n\nLET'S GO AFTER ACTIVATION BY YOUR SPARKASSE\nYou can start with the S-pushTAN app if you are registered for the pushTAN procedure and have got your personal registration letter.\n\n1 - Apply for the pushTAN procedure or switch from your previously used procedure at the online branch of your Sparkasse.\n2 - Download the S-pushTAN app to your iPhone or iPad for free.\n3 - As soon as you have received the registration letter from your Sparkasse, start setting up the S-pushTAN app. \n\nSAFETY\n• The S-pushTAN app communicates exclusively encrypted via tested interfaces and ensures secure data transfer according to German online banking requirements.\n• Access to S-pushTAN is protected by a password you have chosen and optionally by Touch ID or Face ID.\n• The app automatically locks after a short period of time, which means that your data is secured as much as possible even if the iPhone or iPad gets lost.\n• The German TÜV confirms these highest safety standards every year anew.\n\nWORTH TO KNOW\n• In order to be able to use pushTAN, you need an activation by your Sparkasse and a registration letter for the first setup.\n• In order to use the current version of the app, you need iOS from version 13 on your iPhone or iPad.\n• If your iPhone or iPad is jailbroken, S-pushTAN is not executable on it. The important high security standards for the mobile banking we offer cannot be guaranteed on manipulated devices.\n• Please do not deny S-pushTAN any of the requested permissions when setting it up, as these are necessary for the smooth functioning of the app.\n• You get the app for free, but its use can cause costs. Please note the given information of your Sparkasse.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe take the protection of your data very seriously. It is regulated in the privacy policy.

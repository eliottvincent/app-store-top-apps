Download the Coffee Fellows app now and take part in our loyalty program.\nLearn more about the Coffee Fellows brand at https://www.coffee-fellows.com\n\nCoffee Lovers \n\nThe secret recipe of our excellent coffee consists in the know-how and the passion in the preparation. We don't have coffee from machines - every cup of espresso, café crème or cappuccino is lovingly prepared by hand by our baristas with the portafilter machine, making it a true taste experience. It is the art of our baristas to adjust the degree of grinding of our grinders as well as the temperature and brewing time of the coffee machine perfectly to our blend every day.\n\nA Big Family\n\nCoffee Fellows is a coffee shop concept made in Germany. Since the sale of the first coffee to today with over 240 branches, Coffee Fellows has been run as a family business by Kathrin and Stefan Tewes. The two attach great importance to a trusting, personal relationship with their franchise partners. A direct exchange, mutual support and fair give and take are the order of the day at Coffee Fellows. In our opinion, this relationship of trust is the basis of the long-term success of the concept.\n\nIn the coffee shops themselves, the whole family is often involved in the coffee business. Thus, Coffee Fellows is a family business on many different levels. Coffee Fellows not only prepare delicious coffee specialties for families , but also for families. From young to old, the whole family is welcome in our cafés."

The next step seemed obvious, we started searching for a new bigger place to move to. In September 2004, we opened our newly refurbished restaurant in Ta' Xbiex Yacht Marina, and sixteen years later we still call it home! Our appetizing food and passionate team are what made our restaurant one of Malta's most popular casual restaurants.

Using patented software algorithms, the MEATER® app will give you cook time estimates, and guide you towards the juiciest steak, chicken, turkey, fish or other cut of meat that you've ever cooked.\n\nIt’s time to break free from the kitchen or grill and let the MEATER® app monitor your food for you. When your food is ready, you'll receive audio and visual notifications on your smart device. This way, you can stop watching your food cook, giving you more time to focus on the things that matter the most to you.\n\n* Unlike other smart meat thermometers, MEATER® is completely wireless! All of the electronics are contained inside the MEATER® probe, eliminating the need for any external wires.\n\n* Easily connect up to four MEATER® probes at once to cook every steak exactly the way each person likes them.\n\n* The smart Guided Cook™ system lets you know how long to cook your food, when to remove it from heat, and how long to let it rest.

      "label": "CAUTION: CONTAINS WEIRD & WILD FLAVORS\n\nThere is a new way to take the BeanBoozled Challenge. This app lets users play the game (remotely and in person), capture photos, find retailers and order online. \n\nBeanBoozled is a game of risk with two different challenging ways to play. Are you brave enough? \n\nThe original BeanBoozled:  Ten delicious Jelly Belly jelly bean flavors (like Juicy Pear or Pomegranate) have been paired up with ten lookalikes in weird and wild flavors (like Booger or Old Bandage). Will it be Buttered Popcorn or Rotten Egg? Peach or Barf? There’s only one way to find out! \n\nThe BeanBoozled Fiery Five Challenge asks how hot can you handle? Five progressively hot jelly beans range from smoldering Sriracha to scorching Carolina Reaper. Can you handle the heat?\n\nWhat is the BeanBoozled App?\n• Take the game anywhere! Take turns spinning the BeanBoozled wheel in the app to see what flavor you’ll have to try next.\n• The app comes with a video sharing function so you can challenge your friends – wherever they are – in real time. You don’t need to physically be together to play BeanBoozled! Just use the built-in “Challenge A Friend” feature to play with your friend remotely. The app will send an invitation to your friend to play, and once they accept, you’re sharing the same spinner and playing the game together.\n• Take photos while you play in the “Challenge A Friend” mode, or 6-second GIFs of the crazy faces your friends make. Add photo frames and share them to your social media channels.\n• When you run out of a flavor, simply tell the app and the spinner will continue play without landing on what you’re missing.\n• Need more BeanBoozled jelly beans? Search for a store near you with our built-in Store Locator, or use the option to buy online.\n• Not sure what the jelly bean flavors are? Consult the handy flavor menu in the app for a helpful guide.\n\nA Few Tips…\n• DO have a trash can handy at all times. Trust us – you’ll need it.\n• If you're playing BeanBoozled Fiery Five, have some milk, ice cream, rice or honey handy to extinguish the burn.\n• DO NOT let wimps or crybabies play this game. (OK- maybe let them play after all. It can be fun to watch!)\n• DO Make up your own rules. This is BeanBoozled where anything goes! Your imagination is your only limit.\n\nPlaying with your food has never been this much fun!"

Download the Coffee Fellows app now and take part in our loyalty program.\nLearn more about the Coffee Fellows brand at https://www.coffee-fellows.com\n\nCoffee Lovers \n\nThe secret recipe of our excellent coffee consists in the know-how and the passion in the preparation. We don't have coffee from machines - every cup of espresso, café crème or cappuccino is lovingly prepared by hand by our baristas with the portafilter machine, making it a true taste experience. It is the art of our baristas to adjust the degree of grinding of our grinders as well as the temperature and brewing time of the coffee machine perfectly to our blend every day.\n\nA Big Family\n\nCoffee Fellows is a coffee shop concept made in Germany. Since the sale of the first coffee to today with over 240 branches, Coffee Fellows has been run as a family business by Kathrin and Stefan Tewes. The two attach great importance to a trusting, personal relationship with their franchise partners. A direct exchange, mutual support and fair give and take are the order of the day at Coffee Fellows. In our opinion, this relationship of trust is the basis of the long-term success of the concept.\n\nIn the coffee shops themselves, the whole family is often involved in the coffee business. Thus, Coffee Fellows is a family business on many different levels. Coffee Fellows not only prepare delicious coffee specialties for families , but also for families. From young to old, the whole family is welcome in our cafés."

Quickly search for a food (eggs, chicken, strawberries, anything!) and feel confident in exactly how to prepare it for baby.\n\nWith a paid subscription, you can record baby's progress with a digital food log, track baby's favorite foods, make a list of foods you'd like to try later, and track any foods baby has had a reaction to which you can share with doctors and caregivers.  \n\nThis app will be a crucial tool to help you to raise a healthy, happy eater, avoid picky eating, and enjoy family meals!"

      "label": "Weekly updated with new tasty, nutritious and easy recipes that hopefully will help inspire a healthy and sustainable way of eating!\r\n\r\nWelcome to my app! My name is Jenny, and I am the creator of the EatMorePlants app. My own journey towards a plant-based diet started some years ago. I was suffering from constant lack of energy (fatigue), as well as frequent and recurring minor illnesses. Being introduced to the whole-food, plant-based diet changed my way of living. The transition provided me with so many benefits. I felt both my energy level and health significantly improved. The idea that others may benefit of a plant-based diet the same way as I did, inspired me to create the EatMorePlants app.\r\n\r\nThe plant-based lifestyle has a wide variety of advantages that extend beyond you. The future of sustainable living and the future of our ecosystem will partly depend on our ability to adapt a more plant-based diet, and to do that we need great recipes at hand.\n\nI believe balance is key. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Do the best you can, whenever you can!\r\n\nRECIPES:\r\nThe app is filled with 100+ delicious vegan plant-based recipes, using easy-to-find ingredients, that will nourish your body, but never compromise on taste! I prefer to keep food as simple and whole as possible. keep it as whole as possible. New recipes every week!\r\n\r\n\nMEAL PLANS:\r\nIf you are new to the plant-based lifestyle it is crucial that you know where to find all the essential nutrients you need. In collaboration with a certified nutritionist we have created specified weekly meal plans for you to follow.\r\n\r\nSHOPPING LIST:\r\nTo make shopping as easy as possible, every ingredient you select in a recipe can be added to an automatically generated shopping list. You can also shuffle the list to categorize all your ingredients by where they are located in the grocery store or by recipe. You can also add your own items to the shopping list, be it a toothbrush or a cactus.\r\n\r\nAPP FEATURES:\r\n- 100+ delicious plant-based recipes.\r\n- All recipes show calculated nutrition information.\r\n- Filter your recipes by gluten-free, nut-free, oil-free or soy-free.\r\n- Adjust the number of servings needed.\r\n- Weekly meal plans developed in cooperation with certified nutritionist.\r\n- Automatic generated shopping list for your planned meals.\r\n- Save your favourite recipes so you easily find them next time.\r\n- Browse tons of categories like pasta & noodles, baked & stuffed, wraps & burgers.\r\n- No-screen sleep when you’re viewing a recipe.\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIPTION\r\nThe app is free for you to download and use. As a non-premium user, you will get access to shopping lists, numerous recipes & nutrition information, filtering options and more.\r\n\r\nAn ongoing subscription is required to access all app features including weekly meal plans developed in cooperation with certified nutritionists. You can choose a monthly or yearly subscription. A subscription is only going to cost you a cup of coffee a month. Prices may slightly vary, depending on your country and currency.

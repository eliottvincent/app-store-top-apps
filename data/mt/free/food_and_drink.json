Download the Coffee Fellows app now and take part in our loyalty program.\nLearn more about the Coffee Fellows brand at https://www.coffee-fellows.com\n\nCoffee Lovers \n\nThe secret recipe of our excellent coffee consists in the know-how and the passion in the preparation. We don't have coffee from machines - every cup of espresso, café crème or cappuccino is lovingly prepared by hand by our baristas with the portafilter machine, making it a true taste experience. It is the art of our baristas to adjust the degree of grinding of our grinders as well as the temperature and brewing time of the coffee machine perfectly to our blend every day.\n\nA Big Family\n\nCoffee Fellows is a coffee shop concept made in Germany. Since the sale of the first coffee to today with over 240 branches, Coffee Fellows has been run as a family business by Kathrin and Stefan Tewes. The two attach great importance to a trusting, personal relationship with their franchise partners. A direct exchange, mutual support and fair give and take are the order of the day at Coffee Fellows. In our opinion, this relationship of trust is the basis of the long-term success of the concept.\n\nIn the coffee shops themselves, the whole family is often involved in the coffee business. Thus, Coffee Fellows is a family business on many different levels. Coffee Fellows not only prepare delicious coffee specialties for families , but also for families. From young to old, the whole family is welcome in our cafés."

Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead?

No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends\n\nWhy purchase new ingredients when you can focus on what you already have?\n\nHere’s how it works:\n• For Supercook to do its magic, it needs to know all the ingredients you have at home.\n• Visit the pantry page in the SuperCook app and choose from a list of 2000+ ingredients broken down into categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, and many more. \n• Start adding ALL the ingredients you have at home to your SuperCook pantry – including oils, spices, and yes - even that old bottle of Worcestershire sauce in the back of the fridge!\n• Sit back and watch SuperCook work its magic by finding recipes that match your ingredients.\n\nSuperCook’s Unique App Features:\n \n--Customized Recipe Ideas--\nWe’ve consolidated over 11 million recipes from 18,000 recipe websites, in 20 languages to create the largest recipe collection ever.   This knowledge was fed into an AI system that learnt the intricacies of all ingredients and how they can be mixed together.\n\nAll you have to do is build your pantry on the app – and you’re ready to make delicious meals without ever leaving your house!\n\nSuperCook will find you any recipe you need, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a midnight snack.  \n\n--Easily Add Your Ingredients--\nSave time and money with an intelligent pantry. SuperCook’s voice dictation mode allows you to quickly add ingredients to your in-app pantry by simply saying them out loud.\n\nJust open your fridge, click the microphone button, and start listing everything inside. The app will automatically add the ingredients to your pantry for a quick and easy way to find recipes!\n \n--Automatic Recipe Recommendations--\nThe app will automatically find you recipes to make with what’s in your fridge – so all those lost ingredients in the back of your cupboard now have a place on your table.  It’s that simple!\n\nWhen you run out of an ingredient, simply open the SuperCook app and remove it from your pantry -  and all the recipe ideas will adjust accordingly.\n \n--Get Creative in the Kitchen--\nSuperCook inspires new ideas and activities in the kitchen for new cooks, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike.\n\nWith over 11 million recipes available in 20 different languages, SuperCook promises that you’ll never cook the same thing twice (unless you want to, of course!).\n\n--What's on the menu ?--\nThe menu page is where you'll find all your recipe ideas.  Why is it called menu?  Because just like the menu in a restaurant, everything on the menu page is available to you now.  SuperCook instantly analyzes 11 million recipes and finds the ones that match your unique ingredients.\n\nMost likely your menu page will contain thousands of recipes, but don't worry, we've broken them down into helpful categories like soups and stews, appetizers and snacks, salads, entrees, desserts and more.\n\n--Reduce food waste--\nMost people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. SuperCook is one of the best ways to reduce food waste in the home.   It finds recipes that use as many of your ingredients as possible, so nothing goes to waste.    SuperCook makes food waste prevention fun and easy, just open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe.   We help you use what you have, so nothing goes to waste!"

      "label": "FourSix makes brewing pour over coffee easy.\n\nThere are countless ways to brew coffee. For coffee enthusiasts, sometimes these methods can get... complicated. And following a more complex recipe can be difficult, especially in the morning when you haven't had your coffee yet.\n\nPart calculator, part timer, FourSix is designed to take a complicated method for pour over and make it simple and easy, even if you're still not completely awake. Named after the 4:6 method invented by Tetsu Kasuya, FourSix will create a custom pulse pour recipe based on 2 simple questions - Do you like your coffee sweeter or brighter? And how strong do you like your coffee? Instantly, you'll see how each pulse-pour will break down, and how they affect your final cup. When you're ready to start, simply follow along with the Timer telling you exactly how much to pour and when. Not only will you get a great cup of coffee, but you'll be able to do it again the next morning.\n\nTo use FourSix, you'll need a Hario V60 and a scale that measures in grams. Additional helpful tools include a pouring kettle with a narrow spout and a thermometer to test water temperature.\n\nIf you like FourSix, but want even more control over the recipe, you'll want FourSix Pro. A one-time, in-app purchase gives you extra settings so you can dial in your perfect brew exactly how you like. Plus, you'll be supporting future development and more new features to come."

      "label": "THE BASICS: \n1. Yummy and healthy recipes, using natural ingredients.\n2. I love to replace „bad“ ingredients of classic recipes - for example cane sugar or white flour - with more healthy alternatives. Therefore we can still eat dessert. But we get important nutrients, vitamins and minerals at the same time. The result? Food and sugar cravings will say goodbye and you’ll start feeling happy with your healthy diet. \n3. Quick & easy! I know, it’s not possible to spend hours in the kitchen every day. Most recipes are therefore quick, easy & ideal for take-away.\n4. All recipes are perfect for a fit lifestyle. Huge amounts of fats or sugar (alternatives) are therefore not part of the Pam app. It’s my job to have a flat tummy & toned thighs.. and that’s not even that hard!\n5. Take responsibility! If you want to feel amazing, you have to know about what you eat, the quality of the ingredients and how your dish was prepared. You should not give the responsibility about your health to somebody else. That means: less processed foods, more homemade meals!\n\nGET READY FOR:\n• A big selection of recipes - with monthly updates.\n• Special „search“ filters, so you can find the food that YOU enjoy. High protein, no nuts, low carb or vegan? Simply select your preferences.\n• Blog articles and helpful tips on: food knowledge, cooking & fitness tricks, motivation, personal topics and much more.\n• Direct access to all of my workout videos, incl. search filters to find the right video for your goal.\n• Meal & Workout Plan: structure your week of meals and workouts with the intuitive planner feature. Not sure where to start? Just add my „Pam Plan“!\n• Shopping List: add all ingredients of a recipe or have fun writing your own list.\n• Notifications: enable if you want to be notified whenever I publish new content.\n\nRECIPES\n• All recipes are created by me, my brother or my mom!\n• 95% for a fit lifestyle, 5% by my brother Dennis & 100% delicious.\n• Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Sweets, Drinks & Snacks.\n• The recipes are perfect for everyday use, including meal prep ideas. But luckily we also have the time to bake a cake or muffins now and then!\n• Filter according to your dietary needs: vegan, lactose free, gluten free, low calorie, without nuts,  etc.\n• Easy step-by-step cooking instructions.\n• Calories & macros included with every recipe.\n• Type in the number of portions you want to cook. The amounts of ingredients will change accordingly.\n• Meal Planner: structure your week with the meal planner tool. If you feel overwhelmed, you can also copy my „Pam Meal Plan“.\n• Shopping List: make sure you have all ingredients by using the shopping list. Want to replace the apples with pears? No problem.\n\nWORKOUTS\n• Direct access to all my workouts videos.\n• Filter according to your training needs: difficulty level, workout type and focus area.\n• Workout Planner: structure your week of exercise with the workout planner tool. If you want, you can also copy my „Pam Workout Plan“.\n\nBLOG\n• Exclusive articles on fitness, lifestyle & food knowledge. Carbs, protein, fats, sugar .. understand how to nourish your body! I also share articles on cooking tips, meal prep ideas and motivation, to help you stay on track.\n• New podcast episodes with my brother, personal topics & insights on what’s going on behind the curtains.\n\nMEMBERSHIP OPTIONS\n• Free: The app is free to try out, with a selection of free content.\n• Premium: Choose between a monthly or yearly subscription plan to unlock premium recipes and blog content. The first week is free and you can cancel your subscription any time.\n• My Cookbook: unlock all recipes and articles of my last bestseller „You Deserve This“.\n\nI would love to welcome you in the Pam App!\n\nLots of love,\nPam"

Download the Coffee Fellows app now and take part in our loyalty program.\nLearn more about the Coffee Fellows brand at https://www.coffee-fellows.com\n\nCoffee Lovers \n\nThe secret recipe of our excellent coffee consists in the know-how and the passion in the preparation. We don't have coffee from machines - every cup of espresso, café crème or cappuccino is lovingly prepared by hand by our baristas with the portafilter machine, making it a true taste experience. It is the art of our baristas to adjust the degree of grinding of our grinders as well as the temperature and brewing time of the coffee machine perfectly to our blend every day.\n\nA Big Family\n\nCoffee Fellows is a coffee shop concept made in Germany. Since the sale of the first coffee to today with over 240 branches, Coffee Fellows has been run as a family business by Kathrin and Stefan Tewes. The two attach great importance to a trusting, personal relationship with their franchise partners. A direct exchange, mutual support and fair give and take are the order of the day at Coffee Fellows. In our opinion, this relationship of trust is the basis of the long-term success of the concept.\n\nIn the coffee shops themselves, the whole family is often involved in the coffee business. Thus, Coffee Fellows is a family business on many different levels. Coffee Fellows not only prepare delicious coffee specialties for families , but also for families. From young to old, the whole family is welcome in our cafés."

      "label": "Found a recipe on the internet that looks great? Yum! Add it to Whisk and start creating your personal cookbook. Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com. We want to make sure your Whisk experience is the best it can be!"

Whether your approach is baby-led feeding, chunky or smooth purées, or a combination of both, the Baby & Toddler Food Cookbook is a complete guide to introducing your infant to solid foods.\n\n From thin purées all the way to finger foods and beyond, the meals in this baby food app can be tailored to fit your baby’s needs and comfort level.\n This app will take much of the stress out of deciding which foods to give your baby and knowing when and how to prepare them.\n Whether you're introducing solids for the first time, or are a seasoned pro, these app will simplify weaning and make it more enjoyable for everyone.\n\n With recipes from purees to solids, the Baby & Toddler Food Cookbook simplifies the weaning process for you.\n In addition to easy and delicious recipes, Baby & Toddler Food Cookbook also includes information on:\nWeaning your baby and transitioning to solid foods\nTime-saving food preparation tips\nFreezing and reheating your homemade baby food\nTricks on finding the hidden nutrition in everyday food\nPurees, smoothies, finger foods—Choose from more than 50 recipes that will take your little one from purees to solid foods.\nFamily fare—Take dinner to the next level with recipes designed to be enjoyed by your child but shared with the whole family.\n\n What if you could skip the tiny jars and pouches of bland baby food in favor of a more natural, flavor-filled, and family-friendly transition to solid foods? Baby-led feeding (also known as baby-led weaning) is just that. Feeding your baby a variety of healthy, wholesome solid foods, rather than relying solely on purees, is thought to promote motor skills and establish lifelong healthy eating habits.\n\n There are so many milestones with a new baby—smiling, sitting up, sleeping through the night, but one of the most exciting and rewarding is when a baby begins her transition to solid foods. Watching her take her first bites is like a little miracle. She’s being introduced to a wonderful world of flavor, initiated into a human act that will hopefully bring her sustenance and joy her entire life. It all begins with the first bites in the high chair.\n\n Times have changed. Both the flavor and texture of baby foods have been given an upgrade, thanks to recent evidence highlighting the importance of a quick progression between textures and an early exposure to a variety of tastes.\n\n Help your child grow with the healthy, homemade, organic foods inside this baby app.\n\n So come join us now!\n\n- Subscription length: 1 month\n- Free trial: 3 days\n- Price for the subscription after free trial: $1.99\n- Subscription type: auto-renewable\n- Subscription length: 6 months\n- Price for the subscription: $9.99\n- Subscription length: 12 months\n- Price for the subscription: $17.99\n- Payment will be charge to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period\n\n- Privacy: http://lupu.digitallabs.ro/StretchingPrograms/Privacy/\n- Terms: http://lupu.digitallabs.ro/StretchingPrograms/Terms/\n- Contact: http://lupu.digitallabs.ro/StretchingPrograms/Contact/"

      "label": "This App helps you understand kids' nutrition needs and mealtime behavior and provides ideas for serving a variety of foods. It is a must-have app for parents with toddlers and kids from 2 to 7 years old. Created by board-certified professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nWe know how feeding kids can be challenging and exhausting. So we work hard to make it a little easier for you. \r\n\r\n\nOur recipes are easy, delicious, and a great way to add variety to the meals you serve your family. Sometimes changing your mindset and simply offering food in a pressure-free way can minimize mealtime stress. \r\n\r\nThis app features recipe ideas for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks for kids and the whole family. \r\n\r\n\nOur cookbook is constantly being updated with new and seasonal recipes to offer you plenty of options, including vegetarian, vegan, and allergen-free recipes.\r\n\r\n\nYou can filter recipes according to allergens you wish to avoid, dietary preferences, ingredients, prep time, lunchbox-friendly, and more. \r\n\r\nSave your favorite recipes, so you can quickly find ideas for what to cook!\r\n\r\n\nThe fun food ideas section is a free guide with easy activities for creatively offering each food. It is an A to Z food library you can consult according to available foods or ones you want to offer. So if you have no idea how to help your child learn to like broccoli our app gives easy and fun suggestions to help your child be more likely to try it. \r\n\r\n\nOur monthly meal plans are linked to the direct recipe and easy to follow. They can serve as inspiration when you run out of ideas on what to eat. The meal plans are updated monthly with new recipes and seasonal foods so that you can always start the month with fresh ideas.\r\n\r\n\nKids Meals App also features a range of manuals to help establish peaceful meal times with your kids. \r\n\r\n“Division of Responsibility” - A guideline to reduce stress at meals, allowing kids to eat according to their bodies needs for growth. In this guide, you will learn your role as a parent/caregiver and your kid’s role at mealtime.\r\n\r\n“Eating Schedule and Routines” - One of the first things pediatric dietitians recommend is that families implement a predictable meal routine or meal schedule.

Around 20 months, many little ones go through developmental stages in which they show increased fussiness and food refusal with unfamiliar foods.We show you how to make meals more attractive and give tips on how to navigate selective eating. \r\n\r\n“Vegetarian and Vegan Diets” - Families will have resources to build well-planned plant-based diets and understand how to meet nutrient needs for multiple stages in life, including toddlerhood. In addition, there are many vegetarian and vegan recipes in our app.\r\n\r\n“Sensory Aspects” - There are many factors other than behavior that can affect selective eating. In this guide we give tips to help with the sensory aspects related to food refusal and help you understand eating as a sensory-motor experience. \r\n\r\n\nHaving recipes, meal plans, fun food ideas and activities, guides, and strategies right in the palm of your hand is why you should download this app right now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\nFor any questions, message us on our Instagram @KidsMealsApp! \r\n\r\n\nTerms of Use and Privacy Policy: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E9IC-Zz0Yovz8I0yTrfMLAGaIV-eXu0l?usp=sharing"

We will update both apps as we release new firmware updates. \n\nThe Acaia Updater app will display and download all current firmware and information for the above models mentioned including firmware number and release notes. The Acaia Updater will replace the Pearl Model S Updater, Lunar Updater, Orion Updater, and Cinco Updater apps.\n\nYou can visit our blog to see what we have introduced, along with other information that might be useful.\n\nhttp://acaia.co\n\nUnder our Support/FAQ, you can also find more helpful information about how to update and troubleshoot.\n\nContact us through the app or email support@acaia.co if you experience any issues."

Access, customize, and control your grinder through this one interface and take your coffee to the next level. Use the app to tailor your grinding experience: adjust the grinding speed (600-1500 RPM), change the Orbit button’s actions, save profiles for grind by weight or grind by time, and more.\n\nFeatures: \n- Connect and Grind: A suite of immediate actions including a sliding RPM bar for burr control, initiating grind on demand, and enabling reverse burr.\n- RPM Presets: Three highly customizable RPM presets for your grinder. \n- Grinder Status: Button functions, total motor running time information, Orbit serial number, Orbit firmware version, and the power usage of your last grinding session. \n- Orbit Button Action: Customize your grinder’s main button and its actions to suit your workflow including pulse, clean, and pause\n- Auto Settings: Automatically start and stop your grinding depending on if your grinder is connected to a scale, clean sequences, and set your Orbit to switch off after being left idle to save on energy.\n- Advanced Settings: Clear your paired scale connection, reset your grinder to default, toggle your scale connection permissions. \n\nAbout the Presets\nOne of the key features of the companion app is the ability to adjust your grinder with finite detail. Even when not connected to your grinder, you can set three grinding programs by both speed and target weights. In a dedicated section, choose your target weight, enable RPM profiling, and receive readings from previous sessions. Receive data about every grind you perform.\n\nGrinder Connection\nTurn on the Orbit by plugging it into a power source and switching the main button on the back of the platform to on. Press the front button of the Orbit. On the Orbit App select “connect to Orbit” to connect. \n\nPurchase the Orbit and discover other Acaia products by visiting our official website at https://www.acaia.co\nNeed any help?

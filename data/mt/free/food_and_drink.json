Download the Coffee Fellows app now and take part in our loyalty program.\nLearn more about the Coffee Fellows brand at https://www.coffee-fellows.com\n\nCoffee Lovers \n\nThe secret recipe of our excellent coffee consists in the know-how and the passion in the preparation. We don't have coffee from machines - every cup of espresso, café crème or cappuccino is lovingly prepared by hand by our baristas with the portafilter machine, making it a true taste experience. It is the art of our baristas to adjust the degree of grinding of our grinders as well as the temperature and brewing time of the coffee machine perfectly to our blend every day.\n\nA Big Family\n\nCoffee Fellows is a coffee shop concept made in Germany. Since the sale of the first coffee to today with over 240 branches, Coffee Fellows has been run as a family business by Kathrin and Stefan Tewes. The two attach great importance to a trusting, personal relationship with their franchise partners. A direct exchange, mutual support and fair give and take are the order of the day at Coffee Fellows. In our opinion, this relationship of trust is the basis of the long-term success of the concept.\n\nIn the coffee shops themselves, the whole family is often involved in the coffee business. Thus, Coffee Fellows is a family business on many different levels. Coffee Fellows not only prepare delicious coffee specialties for families , but also for families. From young to old, the whole family is welcome in our cafés."

      "label": "THE BASICS: \n1. Yummy and healthy recipes, using natural ingredients.\n2. I love to replace „bad“ ingredients of classic recipes - for example cane sugar or white flour - with more healthy alternatives. Therefore we can still eat dessert. But we get important nutrients, vitamins and minerals at the same time. The result? Food and sugar cravings will say goodbye and you’ll start feeling happy with your healthy diet. \n3. Quick & easy! I know, it’s not possible to spend hours in the kitchen every day. Most recipes are therefore quick, easy & ideal for take-away.\n4. All recipes are perfect for a fit lifestyle. Huge amounts of fats or sugar (alternatives) are therefore not part of the Pam app. It’s my job to have a flat tummy & toned thighs.. and that’s not even that hard!\n5. Take responsibility! If you want to feel amazing, you have to know about what you eat, the quality of the ingredients and how your dish was prepared. You should not give the responsibility about your health to somebody else. That means: less processed foods, more homemade meals!\n\nGET READY FOR:\n• A big selection of recipes - with monthly updates.\n• Special „search“ filters, so you can find the food that YOU enjoy. High protein, no nuts, low carb or vegan?

But luckily we also have the time to bake a cake or muffins now and then!\n• Filter according to your dietary needs: vegan, lactose free, gluten free, low calorie, without nuts,  etc.\n• Easy step-by-step cooking instructions.\n• Calories & macros included with every recipe.\n• Type in the number of portions you want to cook. The amounts of ingredients will change accordingly.\n• Meal Planner: structure your week with the meal planner tool. If you feel overwhelmed, you can also copy my „Pam Meal Plan“.\n• Shopping List: make sure you have all ingredients by using the shopping list. Want to replace the apples with pears? No problem.\n\nWORKOUTS\n• Direct access to all my workouts videos.\n• Filter according to your training needs: difficulty level, workout type and focus area.\n• Workout Planner: structure your week of exercise with the workout planner tool. If you want, you can also copy my „Pam Workout Plan“.\n\nBLOG\n• Exclusive articles on fitness, lifestyle & food knowledge. Carbs, protein, fats, sugar .. understand how to nourish your body! I also share articles on cooking tips, meal prep ideas and motivation, to help you stay on track.\n• New podcast episodes with my brother, personal topics & insights on what’s going on behind the curtains.\n\nMEMBERSHIP OPTIONS\n• Free: The app is free to try out, with a selection of free content.\n• Premium: Choose between a monthly or yearly subscription plan to unlock premium recipes and blog content.

Using patented software algorithms, the MEATER® app will give you cook time estimates, and guide you towards the juiciest steak, chicken, turkey, fish or other cut of meat that you've ever cooked.\n\nIt’s time to break free from the kitchen or grill and let the MEATER® app monitor your food for you. When your food is ready, you'll receive audio and visual notifications on your smart device. This way, you can stop watching your food cook, giving you more time to focus on the things that matter the most to you.\n\n* Unlike other smart meat thermometers, MEATER® is completely wireless! All of the electronics are contained inside the MEATER® probe, eliminating the need for any external wires.\n\n* Easily connect up to four MEATER® probes at once to cook every steak exactly the way each person likes them.\n\n* The smart Guided Cook™ system lets you know how long to cook your food, when to remove it from heat, and how long to let it rest. Simply select the type of meat, cut, and cook you want in the MEATER® app, then sit back and relax as perfect results are achieved.\n\n* For veteran chefs, fully customizable cooking and alert options are available to give you total control over your cooking experience.\n\n* Access your complete cooking history with ‘Previous Cooks’ so you can repeat your favorites whenever you want.\n\nCook smarter with MEATER®!

Paired with the Anova Oven app, you’ll enjoy a fully connected cooking experience and the most advanced features of the Oven.\n\nBreak out of your everyday cooking routine with inspiration from the step-by-step recipes developed specifically for the Anova Precision Oven. With the connected app, you can start cooking with a single button press and the Wi-Fi enabled Oven will preheat to your recipe’s recommended settings. As your food cooks, you’ll be able to keep an eye on your timers and food probe readings remotely, and notifications will alert you when it’s time for the next hands-on step. \n\nIf you want to cook freestyle, you can create your own multi-stage cooking programs in the app. Define the oven settings for each stage of cooking and the transitions between stages to build stress-free, no-compromise recipes for all of your favorite foods. Your cook history is stored automatically so you can replay your past cooks, or share your recipes with the community.  \n\nFeatures:\n- Explore our library of recipes created specifically for the Anova Precision Oven. These recipes span meals, cuisine types, and cooking techniques to educate and inspire you to create your own new dishes.\n- Learn step-by step techniques by following along with clear photos and easy-to-read instructions from top recipe creators. \n- Start cooking any recipe with a single tap. The cook settings are sent to your oven directly.\n- Monitor your cook by watching real time temperature and timer readings. View the oven’s temperature and steam settings, and even monitor the core temperature of your food when using the included food probe. \n- Go freestyle with manual cooking. You can start cooking from the app, or from the oven itself, without relying on specific recipes. \n- Make adjustments on the fly. If dinner is ready but you’re not, add a holding stage to your cook so your food remains at its best. \n- Create multi-stage recipes. Most foods have more that one cooking goal, like achieving juicy meat and crispy skin. Separate your cooking into multiple oven stages to optimize for each goal, like the pros do. With full control over oven functions and the ability to transition automatically based on timer or probe targets, true multi-stage, combi cooking is finally available for home cooks. \n- View your cook history. It’s like having a DVR for your Oven — recipes and manual cooking sessions are automatically saved to your history, making it easy to revisit your favorites."

The next step seemed obvious, we started searching for a new bigger place to move to. In September 2004, we opened our newly refurbished restaurant in Ta' Xbiex Yacht Marina, and sixteen years later we still call it home! Our appetizing food and passionate team are what made our restaurant one of Malta's most popular casual restaurants. Our promise is to keep serving you with the very same passion, dedication and loyalty we began with."

Please consult your doctor to find out what is the best approach for you.\n\nWe show you how much cholesterol is in your food and you will find lots of recipes.\n\n Cholesterol Fat Table helps you to:\n\n* figure out the cholesterol content in food \n* improve your health\n* find healthy recipes and food\n* discover low cholesterol diets\n* prevent heart diseases\n\nThe app consists of an easy to use table which shows the cholesterol content of more than 2500 groceries (most are contained in the free version. Some are only available via the Premium subscription).\n\nAlso the app has a database of more than 500 hundred recipes. Start cooking now (some vegan, some low carb, some suitable for interval fasting)\n\nAccording to wikipedia:\n“Since all animal cells manufacture cholesterol, all animal-based foods contain cholesterol in varying amounts. Major dietary sources of cholesterol include red meat, egg yolks and whole eggs, liver, kidney, giblets, fish oil, and butter.”\n“In 2016, the United States Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) recommended that Americans eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible, because most foods that are rich in cholesterol are also high in saturated fat”\n\nPremium Subscription\nYou can access most cholesterol values using the free version of the app. If you want to unlock all cholesterol values contained in the app you can purchase our paid Premium subscription.\n\n\nTerms of Use: https://bytes-and-pixels.de/en/cholesterol-coach/terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy Policy: https://bytes-and-pixels.de/en/cholesterol-coach/privacy-policy"

      "label": "Found a recipe on the internet that looks great? Yum! Add it to Whisk and start creating your personal cookbook. Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com. We want to make sure your Whisk experience is the best it can be!"

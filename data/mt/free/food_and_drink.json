Download the Coffee Fellows app now and take part in our loyalty program.\nLearn more about the Coffee Fellows brand at https://www.coffee-fellows.com\n\nCoffee Lovers \n\nThe secret recipe of our excellent coffee consists in the know-how and the passion in the preparation. We don't have coffee from machines - every cup of espresso, café crème or cappuccino is lovingly prepared by hand by our baristas with the portafilter machine, making it a true taste experience. It is the art of our baristas to adjust the degree of grinding of our grinders as well as the temperature and brewing time of the coffee machine perfectly to our blend every day.\n\nA Big Family\n\nCoffee Fellows is a coffee shop concept made in Germany. Since the sale of the first coffee to today with over 240 branches, Coffee Fellows has been run as a family business by Kathrin and Stefan Tewes. The two attach great importance to a trusting, personal relationship with their franchise partners. A direct exchange, mutual support and fair give and take are the order of the day at Coffee Fellows. In our opinion, this relationship of trust is the basis of the long-term success of the concept.\n\nIn the coffee shops themselves, the whole family is often involved in the coffee business. Thus, Coffee Fellows is a family business on many different levels. Coffee Fellows not only prepare delicious coffee specialties for families , but also for families. From young to old, the whole family is welcome in our cafés."

No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore.

Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com.

Looking for a meal that will make your tummy and your baby happy? \n\nWe’re here to make your pantry into a one-stop shop of healthy and delicious foods that will give your baby the best start to life.\n\nQUICK TIPS FOR FOODS TO EAT WHEN PREGNANT:\n\n- Dairy products, especially yogurt, are a great choice. They help you meet increased protein and calcium needs.\n- Legumes are super sources of folate, fiber, and many other nutrients. Folate is a very important nutrient during pregnancy.\n- Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of beta carotene, which your body transforms into vitamin A.

      "label": "The Anova Precision® Oven is the first combi oven with pro-level features designed specifically for the home cook. Paired with the Anova Oven app, you’ll enjoy a fully connected cooking experience and the most advanced features of the Oven.\n\nBreak out of your everyday cooking routine with inspiration from the step-by-step recipes developed specifically for the Anova Precision Oven. With the connected app, you can start cooking with a single button press and the Wi-Fi enabled Oven will preheat to your recipe’s recommended settings. As your food cooks, you’ll be able to keep an eye on your timers and food probe readings remotely, and notifications will alert you when it’s time for the next hands-on step. \n\nIf you want to cook freestyle, you can create your own multi-stage cooking programs in the app. Define the oven settings for each stage of cooking and the transitions between stages to build stress-free, no-compromise recipes for all of your favorite foods. Your cook history is stored automatically so you can replay your past cooks, or share your recipes with the community.  \n\nFeatures:\n- Explore our library of recipes created specifically for the Anova Precision Oven. These recipes span meals, cuisine types, and cooking techniques to educate and inspire you to create your own new dishes.\n- Learn step-by step techniques by following along with clear photos and easy-to-read instructions from top recipe creators. \n- Start cooking any recipe with a single tap. The cook settings are sent to your oven directly.\n- Monitor your cook by watching real time temperature and timer readings. View the oven’s temperature and steam settings, and even monitor the core temperature of your food when using the included food probe. \n- Go freestyle with manual cooking. You can start cooking from the app, or from the oven itself, without relying on specific recipes. \n- Make adjustments on the fly. If dinner is ready but you’re not, add a holding stage to your cook so your food remains at its best. \n- Create multi-stage recipes. Most foods have more that one cooking goal, like achieving juicy meat and crispy skin. Separate your cooking into multiple oven stages to optimize for each goal, like the pros do. With full control over oven functions and the ability to transition automatically based on timer or probe targets, true multi-stage, combi cooking is finally available for home cooks. \n- View your cook history. It’s like having a DVR for your Oven — recipes and manual cooking sessions are automatically saved to your history, making it easy to revisit your favorites."

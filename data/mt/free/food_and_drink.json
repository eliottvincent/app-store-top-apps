Download the Coffee Fellows app now and take part in our loyalty program.\nLearn more about the Coffee Fellows brand at https://www.coffee-fellows.com\n\nCoffee Lovers \n\nThe secret recipe of our excellent coffee consists in the know-how and the passion in the preparation. We don't have coffee from machines - every cup of espresso, café crème or cappuccino is lovingly prepared by hand by our baristas with the portafilter machine, making it a true taste experience. It is the art of our baristas to adjust the degree of grinding of our grinders as well as the temperature and brewing time of the coffee machine perfectly to our blend every day.\n\nA Big Family\n\nCoffee Fellows is a coffee shop concept made in Germany. Since the sale of the first coffee to today with over 240 branches, Coffee Fellows has been run as a family business by Kathrin and Stefan Tewes. The two attach great importance to a trusting, personal relationship with their franchise partners. A direct exchange, mutual support and fair give and take are the order of the day at Coffee Fellows. In our opinion, this relationship of trust is the basis of the long-term success of the concept.\n\nIn the coffee shops themselves, the whole family is often involved in the coffee business. Thus, Coffee Fellows is a family business on many different levels. Coffee Fellows not only prepare delicious coffee specialties for families , but also for families. From young to old, the whole family is welcome in our cafés."

Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com. We want to make sure your Whisk experience is the best it can be!"

Looking for a meal that will make your tummy and your baby happy? \n\nWe’re here to make your pantry into a one-stop shop of healthy and delicious foods that will give your baby the best start to life.\n\nQUICK TIPS FOR FOODS TO EAT WHEN PREGNANT:\n\n- Dairy products, especially yogurt, are a great choice. They help you meet increased protein and calcium needs.\n- Legumes are super sources of folate, fiber, and many other nutrients. Folate is a very important nutrient during pregnancy.\n- Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of beta carotene, which your body transforms into vitamin A. Vitamin A is important for the growth and differentiation of cells in your growing baby.\n- Salmon contains the essential omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are important for brain and eye development in your growing baby. It’s also a natural source of vitamin D.\n- Whole eggs are incredibly nutritious and a great way to increase your overall nutrient intake. They also contain choline, an essential nutrient for brain health and development.\n- Broccoli and leafy greens contain most of the nutrients that you’ll need. They’re also rich in fiber, which may help prevent or treat constipation.\n- Lean meat is a good source of high-quality protein. Beef and pork are also rich in iron, choline, and B vitamins, all of which are important nutrients during pregnancy.\n- Berries contain water, carbs, vitamin C, fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, and plant compounds. They may help you increase your nutrient and water intake.\n- Whole grains are packed with fiber, vitamins, and plant compounds. They’re also rich in B vitamins, fiber, and magnesium.\n- Avocados contain high amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids, fiber, folate, and potassium. They may help relieve leg cramps, too.\n- Dried fruit may be highly beneficial for pregnant women since they’re small and nutrient-dense. Just make sure to limit your portions and avoid candied varieties, to prevent excess sugar intake.\n- Drinking water is important as your blood volume increases during pregnancy. Adequate hydration may also help prevent constipation and urinary tract infections.\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\n- You can subscribe for a PRO account\n- Subscription option are 1-week with a 3-day trial, 1-month and 1-year.\n- Subscription automatically renews for the same price and duration period as the original \"one week\", \"one month\", \"one-year\" package unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nTerms of use: http://nikita.wtf/privacy"

      "label": "CAUTION: CONTAINS WEIRD & WILD FLAVORS\n\nThere is a new way to take the BeanBoozled Challenge. This app lets users play the game (remotely and in person), capture photos, find retailers and order online. \n\nBeanBoozled is a game of risk with two different challenging ways to play. Are you brave enough? \n\nThe original BeanBoozled:  Ten delicious Jelly Belly jelly bean flavors (like Juicy Pear or Pomegranate) have been paired up with ten lookalikes in weird and wild flavors (like Booger or Old Bandage). Will it be Buttered Popcorn or Rotten Egg? Peach or Barf? There’s only one way to find out! \n\nThe BeanBoozled Fiery Five Challenge asks how hot can you handle? Five progressively hot jelly beans range from smoldering Sriracha to scorching Carolina Reaper. Can you handle the heat?\n\nWhat is the BeanBoozled App?\n• Take the game anywhere! Take turns spinning the BeanBoozled wheel in the app to see what flavor you’ll have to try next.\n• The app comes with a video sharing function so you can challenge your friends – wherever they are – in real time. You don’t need to physically be together to play BeanBoozled! Just use the built-in “Challenge A Friend” feature to play with your friend remotely. The app will send an invitation to your friend to play, and once they accept, you’re sharing the same spinner and playing the game together.\n• Take photos while you play in the “Challenge A Friend” mode, or 6-second GIFs of the crazy faces your friends make. Add photo frames and share them to your social media channels.\n• When you run out of a flavor, simply tell the app and the spinner will continue play without landing on what you’re missing.\n• Need more BeanBoozled jelly beans? Search for a store near you with our built-in Store Locator, or use the option to buy online.\n• Not sure what the jelly bean flavors are? Consult the handy flavor menu in the app for a helpful guide.\n\nA Few Tips…\n• DO have a trash can handy at all times. Trust us – you’ll need it.\n• If you're playing BeanBoozled Fiery Five, have some milk, ice cream, rice or honey handy to extinguish the burn.\n• DO NOT let wimps or crybabies play this game. (OK- maybe let them play after all. It can be fun to watch!)\n• DO Make up your own rules. This is BeanBoozled where anything goes! Your imagination is your only limit.\n\nPlaying with your food has never been this much fun!"

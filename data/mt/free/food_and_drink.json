Download the Coffee Fellows app now and take part in our loyalty program.\nLearn more about the Coffee Fellows brand at https://www.coffee-fellows.com\n\nCoffee Lovers \n\nThe secret recipe of our excellent coffee consists in the know-how and the passion in the preparation. We don't have coffee from machines - every cup of espresso, café crème or cappuccino is lovingly prepared by hand by our baristas with the portafilter machine, making it a true taste experience. It is the art of our baristas to adjust the degree of grinding of our grinders as well as the temperature and brewing time of the coffee machine perfectly to our blend every day.\n\nA Big Family\n\nCoffee Fellows is a coffee shop concept made in Germany. Since the sale of the first coffee to today with over 240 branches, Coffee Fellows has been run as a family business by Kathrin and Stefan Tewes. The two attach great importance to a trusting, personal relationship with their franchise partners. A direct exchange, mutual support and fair give and take are the order of the day at Coffee Fellows. In our opinion, this relationship of trust is the basis of the long-term success of the concept.\n\nIn the coffee shops themselves, the whole family is often involved in the coffee business. Thus, Coffee Fellows is a family business on many different levels. Coffee Fellows not only prepare delicious coffee specialties for families , but also for families. From young to old, the whole family is welcome in our cafés."

Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com.

Looking for a meal that will make your tummy and your baby happy? \n\nWe’re here to make your pantry into a one-stop shop of healthy and delicious foods that will give your baby the best start to life.\n\nQUICK TIPS FOR FOODS TO EAT WHEN PREGNANT:\n\n- Dairy products, especially yogurt, are a great choice. They help you meet increased protein and calcium needs.\n- Legumes are super sources of folate, fiber, and many other nutrients. Folate is a very important nutrient during pregnancy.\n- Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of beta carotene, which your body transforms into vitamin A. Vitamin A is important for the growth and differentiation of cells in your growing baby.\n- Salmon contains the essential omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are important for brain and eye development in your growing baby. It’s also a natural source of vitamin D.\n- Whole eggs are incredibly nutritious and a great way to increase your overall nutrient intake. They also contain choline, an essential nutrient for brain health and development.\n- Broccoli and leafy greens contain most of the nutrients that you’ll need. They’re also rich in fiber, which may help prevent or treat constipation.\n- Lean meat is a good source of high-quality protein. Beef and pork are also rich in iron, choline, and B vitamins, all of which are important nutrients during pregnancy.\n- Berries contain water, carbs, vitamin C, fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, and plant compounds. They may help you increase your nutrient and water intake.\n- Whole grains are packed with fiber, vitamins, and plant compounds. They’re also rich in B vitamins, fiber, and magnesium.\n- Avocados contain high amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids, fiber, folate, and potassium. They may help relieve leg cramps, too.\n- Dried fruit may be highly beneficial for pregnant women since they’re small and nutrient-dense. Just make sure to limit your portions and avoid candied varieties, to prevent excess sugar intake.\n- Drinking water is important as your blood volume increases during pregnancy. Adequate hydration may also help prevent constipation and urinary tract infections.\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\n- You can subscribe for a PRO account\n- Subscription option are 1-week with a 3-day trial, 1-month and 1-year.\n- Subscription automatically renews for the same price and duration period as the original \"one week\", \"one month\", \"one-year\" package unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nTerms of use: http://nikita.wtf/privacy"

      "label": "A connected cooking experience - Hestan Cue is a video-guided cooking system that automatically controls temperature and time, every step of every recipe. Our smart cookware, induction burner (sold here https://www.hestancue.com/product/hestancue) and recipe app all communicate with each other using Bluetooth® technology and embedded sensors — automatically adjusting the cooking temperature and time as you proceed through each recipe. Hestan Cue is your coach in the kitchen, walking you through each recipe step with video guidance. Try new dishes. Learn new skills. Elevate your cooking without fear of overcooking or underwhelming. Cue doesn’t cook for you – It helps you cook better food, more often.  \n\nVIDEO-GUIDED RECIPES\nHestan Cue is the most dynamic cookbook ever written.  The recipes within our app are created by world renowned chefs.  From the best grilled cheese on Earth to black bass with dill and caviar emulsion, Cue walks you through each step with video guidance.  So even if you’ve never julienned an apple, you’ll see exactly what to do.  And we’re continually updating with new recipes to elevate your cooking - step by step, dish by dish.  \n\nCOOK WITH CONFIDENCE \nHestan Cue automatically controls the vital variables: time and temperature.  As you proceed through the recipe, Cue dials in the optimum cooking temperature for each step.  From porterhouse to duck breast, just tell Cue how well done you like any particular cut, and it automatically adjusts to your preference - so you can always count on that just-right sear and doneness.  \n\nMIX & MATCH\nCue also gives you creative control to cook meals around the ingredients you have on hand.  Select a main ingredient and pair it with the sauce of your choice.  Keep it simple or make it special.  \n\nPRECISION TEMPERATURE CONTROL\nWhat temperature is “med-high”? Or “high”? With Cue, you get the exact temperature you need at that exact moment.  Crispy salmon skin is best seared at 435 degrees.  Cue eliminates the guesswork through each step of every recipe.  Take your skills to the next level and cook up your own creations with Cue’s freestyle mode where you can manually set and maintain specific temperatures using the app.     \n\nCOOKING UP THE FUTURE\nHestan Smart Cooking is inspired by the kitchen of the future - and those who want to cook in it.  We continue developing and devising new tech-enabled products to take us there.  But we’re also obsessed with making the right tool for the job, not just using technology for technology's sake.  When we combine science and culinary craftsmanship thoughtfully, it makes the art of cooking more enjoyable.  Our goal is to help you cook better and inspire you to cook more often."

Download Gluten Free Scanner now! \n\n\nHow to use Gluten Free Scanner?\n\n- Download the app\n- Enable access to your camera\n- Scan a barcode\n- Find out within seconds if the food product is gluten free\n\n\nWhat is a gluten free diet?\n\nA gluten free diet is an eating plan that excludes foods containing gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and triticale (a cross between wheat and rye). A gluten free diet is essential for managing signs and symptoms of Coeliac disease (also known as celiac disease) and other medical conditions associated with gluten. A gluten free diet is also popular among people who haven't been diagnosed with a gluten related medical condition. The claimed benefits of the diet are improved health, weight loss and increased energy\n\n\nWhat is coeliac disease?\n\nCoeliac disease is a condition where your immune system attacks your own tissues when you eat gluten. This damages your gut (small intestine) so you are unable to take in nutrients. Coeliac disease can cause a range of symptoms, including diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating. Coeliac disease is caused by an adverse reaction to gluten, which is a dietary protein found in 3 types of cereal:\n\n- wheat\n- barley\n- rye\n\nGluten is found in any food that contains those cereals, including:\n\n- pasta\n- cakes\n- breakfast cereals\n- most types of bread\n- certain types of sauces\n- some ready meals\n- In addition, most beers are made from barley.\n\n\nWhat causes coeliac disease?\n\nCoeliac disease is an autoimmune condition. This is where the immune system (the body's defence against infection) mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In coeliac disease, the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them. This damages the surface of the small bowel (intestines), disrupting the body's ability to take in nutrients from food. It's not entirely clear what causes the immune system to act this way, but a combination of genetics and the environment appear to play a part.\n\nTreating coeliac disease\n\nThere's no cure for coeliac disease, but following a gluten free diet should help control symptoms and prevent the long-term complications of the condition. Even if you have mild symptoms, changing your diet is still recommended because continuing to eat gluten can lead to serious complications. This may also be the case if tests show that you have some degree of coeliac disease even if you do not have noticeable symptoms. It's important to ensure that your gluten free diet is healthy and balanced. An increase in the range of available gluten free foods in recent years has made it possible to eat both a healthy and varied gluten-free diet."

Whether your approach is baby-led feeding, chunky or smooth purées, or a combination of both, the Baby & Toddler Food Cookbook is a complete guide to introducing your infant to solid foods.\n\n From thin purées all the way to finger foods and beyond, the meals in this baby food app can be tailored to fit your baby’s needs and comfort level.\n This app will take much of the stress out of deciding which foods to give your baby and knowing when and how to prepare them.\n Whether you're introducing solids for the first time, or are a seasoned pro, these app will simplify weaning and make it more enjoyable for everyone.\n\n With recipes from purees to solids, the Baby & Toddler Food Cookbook simplifies the weaning process for you.\n In addition to easy and delicious recipes, Baby & Toddler Food Cookbook also includes information on:\nWeaning your baby and transitioning to solid foods\nTime-saving food preparation tips\nFreezing and reheating your homemade baby food\nTricks on finding the hidden nutrition in everyday food\nPurees, smoothies, finger foods—Choose from more than 50 recipes that will take your little one from purees to solid foods.\nFamily fare—Take dinner to the next level with recipes designed to be enjoyed by your child but shared with the whole family.\n\n What if you could skip the tiny jars and pouches of bland baby food in favor of a more natural, flavor-filled, and family-friendly transition to solid foods? Baby-led feeding (also known as baby-led weaning) is just that. Feeding your baby a variety of healthy, wholesome solid foods, rather than relying solely on purees, is thought to promote motor skills and establish lifelong healthy eating habits.\n\n There are so many milestones with a new baby—smiling, sitting up, sleeping through the night, but one of the most exciting and rewarding is when a baby begins her transition to solid foods. Watching her take her first bites is like a little miracle. She’s being introduced to a wonderful world of flavor, initiated into a human act that will hopefully bring her sustenance and joy her entire life. It all begins with the first bites in the high chair.\n\n Times have changed. Both the flavor and texture of baby foods have been given an upgrade, thanks to recent evidence highlighting the importance of a quick progression between textures and an early exposure to a variety of tastes.\n\n Help your child grow with the healthy, homemade, organic foods inside this baby app.\n\n So come join us now!\n\n- Subscription length: 1 month\n- Free trial: 3 days\n- Price for the subscription after free trial: $1.99\n- Subscription type: auto-renewable\n- Subscription length: 6 months\n- Price for the subscription: $9.99\n- Subscription length: 12 months\n- Price for the subscription: $17.99\n- Payment will be charge to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period\n\n- Privacy: http://lupu.digitallabs.ro/StretchingPrograms/Privacy/\n- Terms: http://lupu.digitallabs.ro/StretchingPrograms/Terms/\n- Contact: http://lupu.digitallabs.ro/StretchingPrograms/Contact/"

      "label": "This App helps you understand kids' nutrition needs and mealtime behavior and provides ideas for serving a variety of foods. It is a must-have app for parents with toddlers and kids from 2 to 7 years old. Created by board-certified professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nWe know how feeding kids can be challenging and exhausting. So we work hard to make it a little easier for you. \r\n\r\n\nOur recipes are easy, delicious, and a great way to add variety to the meals you serve your family. Sometimes changing your mindset and simply offering food in a pressure-free way can minimize mealtime stress. \r\n\r\nThis app features recipe ideas for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks for kids and the whole family. \r\n\r\n\nOur cookbook is constantly being updated with new and seasonal recipes to offer you plenty of options, including vegetarian, vegan, and allergen-free recipes.\r\n\r\n\nYou can filter recipes according to allergens you wish to avoid, dietary preferences, ingredients, prep time, lunchbox-friendly, and more. \r\n\r\nSave your favorite recipes, so you can quickly find ideas for what to cook!\r\n\r\n\nThe fun food ideas section is a free guide with easy activities for creatively offering each food. It is an A to Z food library you can consult according to available foods or ones you want to offer. So if you have no idea how to help your child learn to like broccoli our app gives easy and fun suggestions to help your child be more likely to try it. \r\n\r\n\nOur monthly meal plans are linked to the direct recipe and easy to follow. They can serve as inspiration when you run out of ideas on what to eat. The meal plans are updated monthly with new recipes and seasonal foods so that you can always start the month with fresh ideas.\r\n\r\n\nKids Meals App also features a range of manuals to help establish peaceful meal times with your kids. \r\n\r\n“Division of Responsibility” - A guideline to reduce stress at meals, allowing kids to eat according to their bodies needs for growth.

Around 20 months, many little ones go through developmental stages in which they show increased fussiness and food refusal with unfamiliar foods.We show you how to make meals more attractive and give tips on how to navigate selective eating. \r\n\r\n“Vegetarian and Vegan Diets” - Families will have resources to build well-planned plant-based diets and understand how to meet nutrient needs for multiple stages in life, including toddlerhood. In addition, there are many vegetarian and vegan recipes in our app.\r\n\r\n“Sensory Aspects” - There are many factors other than behavior that can affect selective eating. In this guide we give tips to help with the sensory aspects related to food refusal and help you understand eating as a sensory-motor experience. \r\n\r\n\nHaving recipes, meal plans, fun food ideas and activities, guides, and strategies right in the palm of your hand is why you should download this app right now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\nFor any questions, message us on our Instagram @KidsMealsApp! \r\n\r\n\nTerms of Use and Privacy Policy: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E9IC-Zz0Yovz8I0yTrfMLAGaIV-eXu0l?usp=sharing"

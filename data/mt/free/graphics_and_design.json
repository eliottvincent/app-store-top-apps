It’s so much easier to edit your home screen with so many ideas. I wish they could add widgets that come with it. I told all my friends to get it it’s soooo good. Overall it’s the best app i’ve found so far to make your home screen aesthetic.\n\n\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nPREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION (weekly or annual subscription):\n- Get access to all the features\n- Get premium content updates\n- No ads\n\n\n\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- The account​ will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nYou can read our Privacy policy and Terms of Use at https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/50448913 https://www.iubenda.com/terms-and-conditions/50448913"

Capture and detect colors simply by pointing the camera at the object. The app identifies the color name and color code of the selected area on the screen.\n\n– Color Palette Generator. The application algorithm creates harmonious color palettes and you can adjust color values to your liking. Or you can generate a color palette that complements any color you input.\n\n– Color Harmonies. For each color you collect, the app creates color combinations that go well with a base color (based on color theory and color wheel harmonies). Grab a pre-defined color palette and adjust color values to your liking.\n \nAre you colorblind, unable to distinguish certain color hues, or simply want to know What color is it? It is a simple-to-use app for identifying colors for you!\n \nEasily save, share, duplicate, remove and edit already saved palettes. The app supports the most common color models as RGB, HEX, LAB, HSV, HSL, CMYK and color formats – .PNG, .SVG, .ACO, .ASE, .GPL.\n \nWhether you’re creating visual graphics, painting digitally, designing logos or interfaces, trying to match the brand color theme – being able to select the right color or palette quickly is important. Color Picker AR is a helpful all-in-one color tool for any artist that works with color palettes."

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

The Maltese adaptation has been led to by a working group of professional advisors including psychologists, IT experts and other professionals in the field. Amendments from the original app have been initiated to make the app most relevant to the Maltese context, including vital feedback from young people in Malta facilitated through a number of focus groups. There has also been key collaboration with the key providers of state mental health services in Malta to ensure the app will appropriately address all relevant needs and provides the contact details to all appropriate services.\n\nThe freely accessible app is a mental health promotion and suicide app mobile phone application which will be available both in English and Maltese. It seeks to address the mental health needs of a range of young people in Malta (particularly in the 16-24 age group), providing those from all social settings with access to an app which can support them in mood identification, monitoring, management and modification. It provides appropriate activities to reduce distress, alleviate low moods and resources for monitoring their wellbeing and as well as in accessing local support services depending on the severity of their mental health challenges.\n\nDisclaimer:\nSafeSpace is not a replacement or substitute for professional medical, psychotherapeutic, counselling or other forms of intervention provided by professionals or other service providers. \n\nSafeSpace has made every effort to ensure that information on this site is reliable and accurate at the time of publishing.

      "label": "Breathing is a vital function of our organism - we usually breathe so automatically and so thoughtlessly, so we rarely pay attention to it. Breathing plays a vital role in how you think, feel, rest and recover, and it even impacts your posture and movement. However, focusing on our breathing can be really helpful in uncomfortable and tense situations. The entire process  \nfrom the inhalation  to exhalation  is known as a breathing (or respiration) cycle.\n\nYour respiratory system brings oxygen into your body and helps to remove carbon dioxide. Your lungs are part of your respiratory system. They sit in your chest, protected by your ribcage. Problems with your respiratory system can reduce the oxygen that reaches your lungs, which can make you unwell.\n\nDeep: respiratory rate monitor is a powerful tool for influencing individual health and well-being.\n\nDeep turns your attention to your breath,  focuses on breathing and measures your respiratory rate.  \nThe act of breathing — the movement pattern that powers respiration — is actually a voluntary movement that you can control at will. And because of respiration’s paramount role in keeping you alive, the quality of your breathing can impact virtually all other systems of the body. \n\nDeep helps you to actively use your breathing to positively affect your health and wellness on many levels.\n\nThe app features 4 sections:\n1.GENERAL HEALTH\n2.FOCUS & CALM\n3.ANTISTRESS\n4.IMPROVE SLEEP\n\nChange your breath, change your life.\n\nEXERCISES’ BENEFITS INCLUDE:\nFocus the mind \nSupport  lungs and respiratory functions\nClear the energetic channels\nRejuvenate the nervous system\nRemove toxins\nSettle stress\nMaintain body temperature\nSlow heartbeat \nLower blood pressure and heart rate\nIncrease the strength of the diaphragm\nRelax, lowering the harmful effects of the stress hormone cortisol on the body\nRelieve pain\nPromote sleep\nCope with panic and stress when feeling overwhelmed. \nHelp to sleep when  having insomnia.\nControl hyperventilation \nCalm and regulate the autonomic nervous system (ANS)\nRefocus when  having a busy or stressful day\nEase panic and worry\nDecrease headaches or migraines\nReduce symptoms of anxiety\nImprove cognitive abilities\nManage cravings\nControl or reduce anger responses\nDecreases fatigue\nReduce aggressive behavior in adolescent males\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\n\nDeep:respiratory rate monitor offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n\n- 3 days free + $12.99 per month\n- $ 59.99 per year\n- $129.99 per lifetime\n\nThese prices are for United States customers in US dollars. Pricing in other countries may vary and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on the country of residence.\n\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.

      "label": "Heart feels off? Join 30K+ on QALY, the only app where human experts interpret your ECGs for arrhythmias and palpitations within minutes.\n\nOn QALY, cardiographic technicians monitor your ECG readings 24/7 from your Apple Watch, Fitbit watch, Withings watch, Kardia, or any other at-home ECG device. Cardiographic technicians are experts in heart rhythm analysis who review hospital ECGs for arrhythmias like Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT), Atrial Fibrillation (AFib), PAC and PVC palpitations, and a number of other abnormal heart rhythms. Now, these same technicians are interpreting the ECG readings from your smartwatch!\n\nWith QALY, discover possible new cardiac arrhythmias and palpitations, track known arrhythmias and irregular heartbeats, and unlock deeper insights about your heart health through human technician monitoring.\n\nMoreover, same-day delivery for every ECG interpretation on QALY means getting continual peace of mind before the next available doctor’s appointment!\n\n----\n\nJoin 30K+ heart trackers on QALY:\n\n“I would like to thank everyone reading the ECGs. Because of this app, I went to my doctor and was diagnosed with SVT and was told it was probably never an anxiety disorder. I have lived 15 years of hell thinking I was having intermittent panic attacks and agoraphobia. Getting set up for an ablation. I will be forever grateful.”\n\n— Marcie D, Alabama\n\n“QALY was so helpful in quickly identifying signs of a potentially serious heart condition … Without this service, I would have blown off the ECG and maybe shown it to my primary care doctor at my next appointment a few months away.”\n\n— Lori B, Virginia\n\n“My Apple Watch categorizes my arrhythmia as normal or inconclusive, which makes me question what I’m feeling. Without this app, it would’ve taken me another 6 months to a year to take this to a doctor. With this app, I gained valuable information. Your app is the key.”\n\n— Jessi I, Washington\n\n----\n\nHow QALY ECG interpretations provide peace of mind:\n\n• All ECG watches and heart monitors welcome: Apple Watch, Kardia, Wellue, Fitbit, Withings, Holter monitor, and more\n• Get more from QALY technician interpretations than typical ECG reader, heart rhythm monitor, HRV tracker, or ECG analyzer apps\n• The only ECG app for Apple Watch and other ECG devices that uses human experts to interpret each ECG\n• Instant PR, QRS, and QTc calculations on every ECG reading\n• See ectopic heartbeats (PAC and PVC palpitations) displayed directly on your ECG reader\n• Share QALY technicians’ ECG analysis with your doctor or cardiologist\n• Add notes on each ECG to track your symptoms for a deeper understanding of your heart health\n\n----\n\nThe QALY app displays ECG data by integrating with the Health app. This is not available on the iPad.\n\nDisclaimer: QALY does not practice medicine or provide medical services. The QALY application and service is only for general informational and educational purposes and is in no way intended to, or be relied upon to replace or constitute professional medical care or attention by a qualified healthcare provider.

Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "Put your diet on autopilot with Eat This Much. Tell us your diet goals, the foods you like, your budget, and what your schedule looks like, and we'll automatically generate a complete meal plan to meet your targets. It's like having a personal diet assistant.\n\nWe offer both free accounts and premium accounts. As a free user, you can create a day's meal plan and completely customize it however you want. Each meal can have different preferences, and your nutrition targets can be whatever you like.\n\nAs a premium user, we'll automatically generate a week of meal plans and send them to you with a grocery list via email. As you follow the plans, you can track what you did or didn't eat, and if you deviate from the plans, we make it easy to readjust your targets for the next week to stay on track. Try out the free account to see if our meal plans appeal to you, and upgrade when you're ready.\n\n- Follow any eating style or create your own (works for keto, paleo, vegetarian, vegan, and more)\n- Hit your macros and calorie targets every day\n- Empower yourself with automatic control over your diet\n- Take the anxiety out of picking what to eat\n- Personalize any of our recipes and they'll replace the original\n- Reduce food waste\n- Don't like our suggestions? Easily swap them out or configure the generator to only use foods you like\n- Manage your virtual pantry (with a premium account)\n\nNormal calorie trackers force you to add foods into your diary one by one. And by the end of the day, there's no guarantee that you'll be anywhere near the nutrition targets you're trying to reach. With our automatic planner, there's nothing to track because everything is already entered for you, and all you have to do is follow the plan.\n\n\nSubscription options:\n- You can download the app for free and create/customize as many unique meal plans as you want, and save one to your account.\n- To unlock the features of Eat This Much Premium, you can subscribe for either the monthly or yearly description.\n\nAuto-renew details:\n- The price to subscribe in your currency will be shown in the app before confirming the subscription.\n- After the free trial has ended, payment will be charged to your iTunes Account.\n- Your subscription will auto-renew unless cancelled 24 hours before the end of the current period (the auto-renew will continue with the same frequency that you select, either the monthly price for the  monthly subscription or yearly price for the yearly subscription).\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the same price you initially paid.\n- Auto-renew can be turned off at any time from your iTunes Account Settings.\n- If you cancel your subscription or turn off auto renew in the middle of a billing cycle your account will remain premium until the end of that cycle.\n\nApple health integration:\nApple health syncing can be enabled in Settings -> Apple Health -> Enable Apple Health syncing for Premium users.\n\nWhen Apple Health is enabled:\n- your weight will automatically import and export when you login and when you view your user profile\n- nutrition information will automatically export for meals marked \"I ate this\" when they are first viewed in the app and as you edit them\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.eatthismuch.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of use: https://www.eatthismuch.com/terms/"

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

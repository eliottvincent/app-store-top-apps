      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

The Maltese adaptation has been led to by a working group of professional advisors including psychologists, IT experts and other professionals in the field. Amendments from the original app have been initiated to make the app most relevant to the Maltese context, including vital feedback from young people in Malta facilitated through a number of focus groups. There has also been key collaboration with the key providers of state mental health services in Malta to ensure the app will appropriately address all relevant needs and provides the contact details to all appropriate services.\n\nThe freely accessible app is a mental health promotion and suicide app mobile phone application which will be available both in English and Maltese. It seeks to address the mental health needs of a range of young people in Malta (particularly in the 16-24 age group), providing those from all social settings with access to an app which can support them in mood identification, monitoring, management and modification. It provides appropriate activities to reduce distress, alleviate low moods and resources for monitoring their wellbeing and as well as in accessing local support services depending on the severity of their mental health challenges.\n\nDisclaimer:\nSafeSpace is not a replacement or substitute for professional medical, psychotherapeutic, counselling or other forms of intervention provided by professionals or other service providers. \n\nSafeSpace has made every effort to ensure that information on this site is reliable and accurate at the time of publishing.

Subscriptions renew at the original price. You can turn off auto-renew at any time and still receive full functionality until the end of your current period, but no refund can be provided for unused portions of the subscription.

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space! \n \nAnimal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals. \n \nUse the program’s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans. \n \nWHAT’S INCLUDED?\n \nAnimal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program:\n \nSection 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program’s movements.  You’ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here. \n \nSection 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You’ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout. \n \nSection 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long. \n \nWe’ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you’ll always have something new to try.\n \nWHO SHOULD TRY IT?\n \nAnimal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace.\n \n \nAnimal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility and grow your strength and power Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you’ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines. \n \nLIMITATIONS\n \nAnimal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.\n\n\n•If a free trial is offered that amount of trial days are free, cancel within trial to not be charged.\n\n\n•Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n\n•Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\n\n•Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n\n\n•Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.\n\n\n•Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTo view our terms of service, please visit\nhttps://ondemand.animalflow.com/page/terms-of-service/\n\n\nTo view our privacy policy, please visit\nhttps://ondemand.animalflow.com/page/privacy/\n \nDISCLAIMER:\nYou will be required to sign up for an auto-renewable In-App Purchase before you are granted access to non-paid features and content.

You may also have better posture and a better sense of well-being.\n\nIf you are looking to strengthen your abdomen and pelvis as well as maintain good posture, then Pilates is for you. It also has a strong mind/body connection, so you may like it if you enjoy yoga but need a more intense core workout.\n\nThere is limited evidence to support the use of Pilates to alleviate lower back pain, improve strength, and prevent elderly people from falling. It has not been shown to be effective treatment for any medical condition.\n\nPilates is great for strengthening and toning your core and for increasing your flexibility, but it’s not a comprehensive strength building program. You will need to supplement it with some other exercises if you want to build up your arm or calf muscles. Talk to your trainer to see what would be best. And don’t forget your cardio!\n\nPilates involves precise moves and specific breathing techniques. It’s not for you if you prefer a less structured program. It also won’t fit your needs if you are looking for an aerobic workout.\n\nPilates can be very demanding, so start slowly. Instructors do not have to be licensed, so it’s best to get recommendations before selecting one."

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\r\n\r\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "Just five minutes a day can transform your life! Whether you’re seeking health and joy or peace and love, whether it’s success in the world or inner exploration you’re striving for, these 5-minute practices are designed to help you cut through the struggle and walk through life with ease. \n\nThe app includes guided instruction videos with demos and explanations for each of the seven practices. The videos are available offline too, so once downloaded, the app needs no internet connection.\n\nThe seven practices include:\n\nYoga for Health\nThis practice is a simple way to activate the energy nodules in your joints and exercise your muscles, bringing ease to the whole system.\n\nYoga for Success\nThe energy and neurological systems branch out in a big way in the region of the shoulder blades and above. The neck practices activate these systems, bringing alertness and intellectual sharpness.\n\nYoga for Wellbeing\nYoga Namaskar is a powerful practice that nurtures the physical, psychological and energy dimensions of a human being.\n\nYoga for Peace\nThe Nadi Shuddhi practice cleanses the nadis – the pathways through which pranic energy flows – resulting in a balanced system and psychological wellbeing.\n\nYoga for Joy\nNada Yoga – the yoga of sound or reverberation – allows you to utter the sounds that create an inner atmosphere of joy, making it a natural way to be.\n\nYoga for Inner Exploration\nShambhavi Mudra is an easy, effortless process that enhances your perception and makes you receptive to that dimension of life, often termed as Grace.\n\nYoga for Love\nThe many nerve endings in your palms make them very sensitive. By placing them together in a Namaskar, you can change your chemistry to foster love within.\n\nBenefits of Upa Yoga\n\nDesigned by Sadhguru, these practices are based on the science of Upa Yoga, which is oriented towards physical and psychological benefits. \nThese practices help: \n- Enhance vitality, focus, memory and productivity\n-Stabilize the body, mind and emotions\n- Strengthen and stabilize the spine\n- Help relieve back pain, stress, anxiety and tension\n- Help relieve chronic ailments and improve overall health\n- Enhance teamwork and communication\n- Impart a lasting sense of joy, peace and fulfillment\n\nPractice Guidelines\n- The practices can be done at any time and anywhere. It is best to do them in the sequence given in the app. Each practice can also be done individually, if your focus is only on some of the aspects. \n- If you are looking at doing just one practice, we recommend doing Yoga Namaskar for overall wellbeing.\n- A light stomach is recommended (keep a 1.5-hour gap after food). If you do not fulfill this condition on a particular day, please skip the Yoga Namaskar practice.\n- Anyone over 7 years of age can do the practices.\n\nAbout Sadhguru\nSadhguru is a yogi, mystic and visionary, offering the science of yoga in a format relevant to contemporary minds. Provocative, insightful and unfailingly witty, Sadhguru’s talks have earned him the reputation of a speaker and opinion-maker of international renown on spiritual matters, business, environmental and international affairs. Sadhguru’s presence has touched and transformed millions of lives in ways that cannot be expressed.  \n\nSadhguru is also the founder of Isha Foundation, a non-religious, non-profit organization supported by over 2 million volunteers and 200 centers worldwide. The foundation has been dedicated to the wellbeing of the individual and the world for the past three decades."

      "label": "You are worthy of treating yourself well, starting with what you eat.\n\nWith Shape, build awareness of what and why you eat through a lens of self-compassion. Steeped in this awareness, nourish and respect your body through the foods you choose daily. Healthy eating becomes a significant act of self-care.\n\nBut we know reshaping your life is more complex than just a simple choice. Grounded in behavior science, Shape is an app — like a coach you carry in your pocket — that teaches you ways to add more nutritious foods to your meals and helps you develop strategies to improve your eating habits. \n\nWe guide you through making adjustments to your routines so that eating well becomes easy.\n\nIt’s not about restricting foods or counting calories to achieve a weight loss goal. Instead, explore your relationship around the food you eat so you can make informed decisions about your choices. You are constantly evolving; it’s time to open the door of possibilities with Shape.\n\nAnchor Your Awareness\nGrow your awareness about your eating patterns through simple keystone habits. Recognize how various foods make you feel with mindful eating exercises. Reconnect with the essential flavors of foods to appreciate each meal you eat. Learn ways to encourage yourself to eat more healthy, nutritious food.\n\nListen to Your Body\nUnderstand your body’s cues of hunger and satiety so you can respect how much (and what!) your body needs to eat in order to feel your best. Move in ways that you love in order to support both your physical and mental well-being.\n\nNourish Yourself Wisely\nDiscover the core pillars of nutrition. Eat in ways that nurture who you truly are. Take a holistic approach to your health, starting with what you eat but also by finding ways to move every day, practicing self-compassion, improving your sleep habits, being mindful, and nurturing your connections with others.\nReach your goals — whether you want to lose weight, stay active as you age, manage emotional eating, or more — by making small, sustainable changes to your habits and routines.\n\nShape is from the creators of Fabulous, an award-winning app featured on Lifehacker, the New York Times, Self, Forbes, GirlBoss, and more. We’ve already helped millions of people worldwide achieve their goals through the power of habits and routines. We understand that change is made through small, repeated actions taken over time. Now we are helping people adjust how they approach their health. By using behavior science, it becomes impossible not to succeed!\n\nEating “perfectly” is impossible. Instead, learn to make conscious, proactive choices toward your health. We guide you on your journey toward nourishing yourself wisely with:\n– Coaching series: Topics like managing stress eating, dealing with cravings, cultivating gratitude for your food, and more. Get a boost of support through difficult moments and inspiration to keep on track.\n– Journeys: Step-by-step guides to establish food and health habits (and break unhelpful ones) that help you reach your goals.\n– Food tracker and journal: Stay accountable for your choices and identify patterns. Explore your relationship with food and shed light on what’s supporting your well-being and what needs to change. Appreciate the variety and beauty of the foods you eat.\n\nGo beyond healthy eating: replace judgment with curiosity and exchange comparison for compassion. You do not need to be a certain weight or have a certain body type to deserve self-kindness. You already have a body to treasure.\n\nEat well, but not to become worthy. Because you are already worthy, choose to eat well.\n\n-------\n\nRead our full terms and conditions and our privacy policy at: https://www.thefabulous.co/terms.html"

Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

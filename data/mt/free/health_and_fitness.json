      "label": "How We Feel is a free app created by scientists, designers, engineers, and therapists to help people better understand their emotions and find strategies to help them navigate their emotions in the moment. Conceived in conjunction with Yale University's Center for Emotional Intelligence and based on the work of Dr Marc Brackett, How We Feel helps people find the right word to describe how they feel while tracking their sleep, exercise, and health trends using HealthKit in order to spot patterns over time.\n\nFounded as a science-based nonprofit, How We Feel is made possible by donations from people who are passionate about bringing mental wellbeing to the widest possible audience. Our data privacy terms are clear and easy-to-understand: all of your data is kept on your device unless you opt-in to send an anonymized version of your check-ins to be used in research to help more people.\n\nWhether you are downloading this app in order to build better relationships, make your emotions to work for you, not against you, improve how you handle stress and anxiety or simply to feel better, How We Feel will help you identify patterns through daily HealthKit tracking and find emotional regulation strategies that will work for you. The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

It can even use your physical activity and local weather to adjust the goal specifically for you every day.\nINTEGRATES: Your activity level affects how much water you need to drink. Connect to Apple Health, Fitbit, Under Armour Record, or Withings HealthMate to use your activity level to automatically adjust your goal. You can also save your hydration records to Apple Health or Fitbit.\nHISTORY: See your hydration progress over time in a daily and monthly view. How many days in a row can you reach your goal?\nFRIENDS: Keep an eye on your friends’ progress to make sure they are staying hydrated. Start some friendly competition to see who can meet their goal the most days in a row.\nFUN REMINDERS: This app will send notifications when you begin to fall behind and need to drink more water. The HidrateSpark smart water bottle will also light up and glow to remind you to stay hydrated.\nNEVER LOSE IT: Losing your water bottle is no fun, so we made it harder for this to happen. When location services are turned on, this app will record the last place it was connected to your HidrateSpark smart water bottle, and show you a map so you can go back and get it.\n\nThis app works best when paired with a Hidrate Spark Smart Water Bottle. But even without one, all the other features will still work for you as a water intake and hydration tracker! You can get a hydration goal, manually record your fluid intake, track your history, share with friends, and get hydration reminders on your iOS device.\n\nBenefits of water:\n\nHEALTH: Alongside a healthy diet and proper exercise, hydration can help dramatically improve your physical health.\nSKIN: Proper hydration helps skin retain moisture for a bright, healthy glow\nCOGNITION & MOOD: Your brain is 75% water, so proper hydration can have a positive impact on cognitive function and mood.\nATHLETIC PERFORMANCE: Even 1-2% dehydration can decrease physiological performance, and 5% dehydration can decrease your physical performance by 30%. So if you want to win, you better be hydrated.\nWEIGHT LOSS: Combined with a healthy diet and exercise, drinking water can increase your metabolism and help you avoid eating and drinking extra calories.\nINCREASED ENERGY: Drinking plenty of water helps with blood circulation, thus decreasing your feeling of tiredness and fatigue. \nAVOID HEADACHES: Staying properly hydrated can help avoid headaches.  \nHEALTHIER SKIN: Staying properly hydrated helps your skin stay hydrated to help it look younger and healthier.  \nBOOST IMMUNITY: Staying properly hydrated can help you fight off illness and infections.\nPREGNANCY: Pregnant and breastfeeding moms need to be properly hydrated so they can support their new baby. \n\nLearn more about HidrateSpark products at www.hidratespark.com"

Plus you’ll have more money and healthier loved ones.\n\nUsing hypnosis is the most effective way of stopping smoking for good according to a study by New Scientist (Vol 136 Issue 1845). \n\nEmbark on our QUIT program now for a radical change in your behavior and quit smoking once and for all. Because to QUIT smoking you have to cultivate the belief and feeling that you are a non smoker. Hypnosis allows you to get directly to the root of the problem and therefore change your beliefs and feelings about smoking forever.\n\nThis easy to follow program will allow you to really see how smoking has been manipulating you. Each audio has been specifically designed to destroy all the facets of your addiction to smoking so that you can enjoy a happier, healthier and smoke free life.\n\nHypnosis is a powerful tool, but it still can sometimes need complimentary therapy or counseling sessions in conjunction with this. As it highly depends on how much work the user is willing to invest this series does not guarantee complete stopping of smoking for everyone.\n\nThis app contains a subscription:\n- You can subscribe for this App to get access to unlimited accounts and features\n- Subscription options are: 1-week with 3-day trial or 1-month.\n- Links to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy can be found below\nhttps://quit-smoking-hypnosis.app/terms-conditions/\nhttps://quit-smoking-hypnosis.app/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Tell us your diet goals, the foods you like, your budget, and what your schedule looks like, and we'll automatically generate a complete meal plan to meet your targets. It's like having a personal diet assistant.\n\nWe offer both free accounts and premium accounts. As a free user, you can create a day's meal plan and completely customize it however you want. Each meal can have different preferences, and your nutrition targets can be whatever you like.\n\nAs a premium user, we'll automatically generate a week of meal plans and send them to you with a grocery list via email. As you follow the plans, you can track what you did or didn't eat, and if you deviate from the plans, we make it easy to readjust your targets for the next week to stay on track. Try out the free account to see if our meal plans appeal to you, and upgrade when you're ready.\n\n- Follow any eating style or create your own (works for keto, paleo, vegetarian, vegan, and more)\n- Hit your macros and calorie targets every day\n- Empower yourself with automatic control over your diet\n- Take the anxiety out of picking what to eat\n- Personalize any of our recipes and they'll replace the original\n- Reduce food waste\n- Don't like our suggestions? Easily swap them out or configure the generator to only use foods you like\n- Manage your virtual pantry (with a premium account)\n\nNormal calorie trackers force you to add foods into your diary one by one. And by the end of the day, there's no guarantee that you'll be anywhere near the nutrition targets you're trying to reach. With our automatic planner, there's nothing to track because everything is already entered for you, and all you have to do is follow the plan.\n\n\nSubscription options:\n- You can download the app for free and create/customize as many unique meal plans as you want, and save one to your account.\n- To unlock the features of Eat This Much Premium, you can subscribe for either the monthly or yearly description.\n\nAuto-renew details:\n- The price to subscribe in your currency will be shown in the app before confirming the subscription.\n- After the free trial has ended, payment will be charged to your iTunes Account.\n- Your subscription will auto-renew unless cancelled 24 hours before the end of the current period (the auto-renew will continue with the same frequency that you select, either the monthly price for the  monthly subscription or yearly price for the yearly subscription).\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the same price you initially paid.\n- Auto-renew can be turned off at any time from your iTunes Account Settings.\n- If you cancel your subscription or turn off auto renew in the middle of a billing cycle your account will remain premium until the end of that cycle.\n\nApple health integration:\nApple health syncing can be enabled in Settings -> Apple Health -> Enable Apple Health syncing for Premium users.\n\nWhen Apple Health is enabled:\n- your weight will automatically import and export when you login and when you view your user profile\n- nutrition information will automatically export for meals marked \"I ate this\" when they are first viewed in the app and as you edit them\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.eatthismuch.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of use: https://www.eatthismuch.com/terms/"

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "Breathing is a vital function of our organism - we usually breathe so automatically and so thoughtlessly, so we rarely pay attention to it. Breathing plays a vital role in how you think, feel, rest and recover, and it even impacts your posture and movement. However, focusing on our breathing can be really helpful in uncomfortable and tense situations. The entire process  \nfrom the inhalation  to exhalation  is known as a breathing (or respiration) cycle.\n\nYour respiratory system brings oxygen into your body and helps to remove carbon dioxide. Your lungs are part of your respiratory system. They sit in your chest, protected by your ribcage. Problems with your respiratory system can reduce the oxygen that reaches your lungs, which can make you unwell.\n\nDeep: respiratory rate monitor is a powerful tool for influencing individual health and well-being.\n\nDeep turns your attention to your breath,  focuses on breathing and measures your respiratory rate.  \nThe act of breathing — the movement pattern that powers respiration — is actually a voluntary movement that you can control at will. And because of respiration’s paramount role in keeping you alive, the quality of your breathing can impact virtually all other systems of the body. \n\nDeep helps you to actively use your breathing to positively affect your health and wellness on many levels.\n\nThe app features 4 sections:\n1.GENERAL HEALTH\n2.FOCUS & CALM\n3.ANTISTRESS\n4.IMPROVE SLEEP\n\nChange your breath, change your life.\n\nEXERCISES’ BENEFITS INCLUDE:\nFocus the mind \nSupport  lungs and respiratory functions\nClear the energetic channels\nRejuvenate the nervous system\nRemove toxins\nSettle stress\nMaintain body temperature\nSlow heartbeat \nLower blood pressure and heart rate\nIncrease the strength of the diaphragm\nRelax, lowering the harmful effects of the stress hormone cortisol on the body\nRelieve pain\nPromote sleep\nCope with panic and stress when feeling overwhelmed. \nHelp to sleep when  having insomnia.\nControl hyperventilation \nCalm and regulate the autonomic nervous system (ANS)\nRefocus when  having a busy or stressful day\nEase panic and worry\nDecrease headaches or migraines\nReduce symptoms of anxiety\nImprove cognitive abilities\nManage cravings\nControl or reduce anger responses\nDecreases fatigue\nReduce aggressive behavior in adolescent males\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\n\nDeep:respiratory rate monitor offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n\n- 3 days free + $12.99 per month\n- $ 59.99 per year\n- $129.99 per lifetime\n\nThese prices are for United States customers in US dollars.

The Maltese adaptation has been led to by a working group of professional advisors including psychologists, IT experts and other professionals in the field. Amendments from the original app have been initiated to make the app most relevant to the Maltese context, including vital feedback from young people in Malta facilitated through a number of focus groups. There has also been key collaboration with the key providers of state mental health services in Malta to ensure the app will appropriately address all relevant needs and provides the contact details to all appropriate services.\n\nThe freely accessible app is a mental health promotion and suicide app mobile phone application which will be available both in English and Maltese. It seeks to address the mental health needs of a range of young people in Malta (particularly in the 16-24 age group), providing those from all social settings with access to an app which can support them in mood identification, monitoring, management and modification. It provides appropriate activities to reduce distress, alleviate low moods and resources for monitoring their wellbeing and as well as in accessing local support services depending on the severity of their mental health challenges.\n\nDisclaimer:\nSafeSpace is not a replacement or substitute for professional medical, psychotherapeutic, counselling or other forms of intervention provided by professionals or other service providers. \n\nSafeSpace has made every effort to ensure that information on this site is reliable and accurate at the time of publishing.

      "label": "Macadam is the first step counter app that makes you earn money when you walk.\n\nEvery step you do is tracked in the app with our pedometer and is automatically rewarded with real financial gains. \n \nLooking for a pedometer that really motivates you by paying you for each step? It's right here!\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE PROFITS WITH MACADAM \n\nStep #1 Macadam connects to your phone's step counter via Apple Health \nStep #2 The app earns you corners every time you put one foot in front of the other, whether it's a walk or a real run. \nStep #3 You can then exchange this virtual currency for real euros, spend your earnings at our partners or request a bank transfer. \n \nPut on your sneakers and go for a walk or a run, we promise you that it pays off!\n\nMacadam works equally well for walking, hiking, running or even a marathon. \n\nWHY A PEDOMETER THAT PAYS ME? \n \nTo fight against sedentary lifestyle! One human out of 2 has a sedentary lifestyle, which is a real health problem. \n\nMany people find it difficult to motivate themselves and stay in shape. So we try a funny and modern approach: The Reward! Rewarding people with money when they motivate themselves by walking. \n\nWith Macadam you can either walk or run! What matters to us is to reward you for getting moving. \n\n\nSTEP COUNTER APP FEATURES: \n\n- Pedometer (Number of steps, distance and kilometers traveled)\n- Calorie Tracker (Number of KCAL calories burned) \n- Step converter (convert your steps into euros) \n\n\n\nWHAT HEALTH AND WALKING DATA IS AVAILABLE?\n\nLike all step counters, our pedometer gives you access to the number of your daily steps, as well as a tracking of caloric expenditure and distance traveled.\nOf course, your data is completely anonymous and we will never sell it. \n\nMacadam does not use any GPS data and does not affect your battery.  \n \n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS : \n\n- What currency do I earn with the Macadam pedometer? \n\nThe app allows you to earn coins. This currency can be exchanged into money (euros) with a few clicks in the app. \nAlthough it is a virtual currency, coins are not a cryptocurrency, and we are not a web3-based move-to-earn app. \n\n- Is the step counter reliable? \n\nYes, we use data from Apple Health pedometer step sensor. For even more accuracy, you can use any connected watch or bracelet compatible with Apple Health (Apple Watch, Withings, Honor, Suunto, Fossil, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n\n- Can I use it for running? \n\nOf course you can! Macadam works perfectly with running. \n\n- Are you affiliated with any other apps that pay for walking (walk to earn)? \n\nMacadam is an independent walk to earn app and is not affiliated with Sweatcoin, StepN, Walk and Earn, million Steps, Fancy Gifts, Nike+ Running, Strava, Charity Miles, Runkeeper, Endomondo, Calo, Fitmint, Movn, Wirtual, Istep, Aglet, Moofit, Movez\n\n\nGrab your legs, your feet, put on your shoes, your sneakers, go for a run or a walk and start earning money with Macadam step counter. \n\nYou walk ? We reward! Download Macadam"

Benefit from the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method, trusted by hundreds of millions adopters worldwide!\n\nPerfect for establishing a basic eating discipline, Simple is ideal for keeping yourself in good shape during self-isolation, with our educational and motivational content on staying mindful about your eating habits.\n\nPopularized by celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé, intermittent fasting is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans. It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I.

You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "WHOOP is your personalized digital fitness and health coach. Get the all-new WHOOP 4.0, our most advanced WHOOP yet, and pair it with your phone to unlock powerful personal insights, available directly in the WHOOP app.\n\nThe WHOOP app does so much more than track activity. WHOOP monitors your physiological data 24/7 to provide you with insights into your sleep habits, training, recovery, and overall health. WHOOP calibrates to your data over time, giving you personalized recommendations and coaching on what you can do – from when to go to bed to what behaviors to adopt – to optimize your performance and your health. This app requires a WHOOP wearable.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nSleep: Every night, WHOOP calculates your sleep performance by measuring the sleep you got compared to the sleep your body needs. You’ll wake up to a sleep score from 0 to 100%. Sleep Coach lets you know when you should go to bed to optimize your performance the following day. Now, with the release of WHOOP 4.0, Sleep Coach can also wake you when you’ve set an exact time, once you’ve reached your sleep goal, or when you’re fully recovered using a quiet, vibrating haptic alarm.\n\nStrain: WHOOP does more than just track your activity – it measures how much physical and mental stress you put on yourself throughout your entire day. WHOOP considers your exercise, work, errands, travel, parenting, and more to calculate a daily Strain score ranging from 0 to 21. Strain Coach then recommends your optimal target exertion range based on your Recovery score to help you maximize your gains without sacrificing your Recovery.\n\nRecovery: WHOOP lets you know how ready you are to perform by measuring your heart-rate variability, resting heart rate, sleep, and respiratory rate. You’ll get a daily Recovery score on a scale of 0 to 100%. When you’re in the green, you’re ready for strain, when you’re in the yellow or red, you may want to evaluate your training program. \n\nHealth: With the all-new WHOOP 4.0, you can now get a big-picture look at your overall health. The new WHOOP 4.0 features an SPO2 sensor and skin temperature sensor to measure your blood oxygen levels and skin temperature, in addition to your heart rate, resting heart rate, and heart-rate variability. You can easily see when your health is improving, or when you might be deviating from your baseline due to stress, illness, and more. Plus, you can download your personalized health reports to send to your physician, coach, or family.\n\nWhat else you can do in the WHOOP app:\n• Behavioral journal: Log daily behaviors – alcohol, nutrition, caffeine, meditation, electronic usage, stress and more – to see which choices impact your performance most\n• Dive into your weekly & monthly performance: Weekly and monthly Performance Assessments give you a better look at how individual behaviors and choices add to or detract from your performance\n• Join a team: Stay motivated and accountable by joining a team. Chat directly with your teammates in the app, or as a coach, see how your team’s training is going.\n• WHOOP Live: Overlay real-time Recovery, Sleep, Strain or heart-rate data onto your videos\n• Get help: Membership Services is available to answer any of your questions directly from the app\n• AMA: WHOOP experts are available weekly to answer your burning questions \n• Apple Health: WHOOP integrates with Apple’s Health app to sync activities and personalize your experience\n• Menstrual Cycle Coaching: Members who have a natural menstrual cycle gain strain and sleep coaching recommendations to account for monthly hormonal changes\n\n* Continued use of GPS and Bluetooth running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

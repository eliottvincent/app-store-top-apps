      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level.

You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

Plus, it works not only with Fitbit, but with other trackers as well.\n\n- Fitbit: Alta, Versa, Inspire, Ionic, Ace, Blaze, Flex, Charge, Surge, One, Zip, Force\n- Misfit Shine\n- Xiaomi Band\n- Jawbone UP\n- Withings Pulse\n- All the other trackers that supports Bluetooth Low Energy connection\n\n“Thank you. It does exactly what it describes, helps me find my Fitbit within 2 minutes. “\n\n\"It was hidden in plain sight but I didn't have time for this!!! Yah!!! I love it!!!\"\n\n“It first tells me whether my Fitbit is within the room or not; once I locate the room, walk around, it turns green to notify me that I’m getting close. Then I found my Flex, right under the coffee table!”\n\n“Wish I had downloaded this app earlier, so I didn’t need to spend the whole week searching for it.”\n\nAs long as your fitness tracker still has a little power, it generates signal. This app listens to the strength of the signal, and helps you quickly locate the beaming wristband by using Low Pass Filtering and Maximum Likelihood algorithm.\n\n• You can subscribe for Premium Fitbit Finder inside the app; subscriptions are billed weekly or monthly at the rate selected depending on the subscription plan.\n• Alternatively a one-time payment plan is available (this is not a subscription).\n• Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n• To manage your subscriptions or turn off auto-renewal:\n  - Go to Settings > iTunes & App Store\n  - Tap your Apple ID at the top of the screen\n  - Tap View Apple ID.

You might feel anxious, constantly irritated, or even depressed. There is no shame in getting help while you get back on your feet. \n\nSensa is here to guide you through the entire journey to self-care, unlocking scientifically backed information to help you understand yourself better on your own terms.\n\nJust in 1–3 months, you will start your day with a new outlook on life.\n\nMeet your calm mind assistant:\n\n\nSelf-paced lessons\n\nHeal at your own pace and learn all about calming your mind with daily lessons about mental health. Understand how your thoughts, emotions, and behaviour are tightly interconnected, and start to untangle negative patterns using proven techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) experts.\n\n\nEasy daily tasks\n\nTry out quick yet effective 10–30-minute activities that help you create healthy lifelong habits. Find out which new habits are perfect for you and create a daily routine that puts you at ease. Build up your resilience to stress as you set up your morning, evening, and wind-down routines that bring peace to your day.\n\n\nMood journal\n\nDeep dive into your subconsciousness as you explore how you tend to react to challenges and victories. Track your mood in a mood journal, analyse the patterns that emerge, identify emotional triggers, and understand yourself better with every passing day. To feel better, you might need to eliminate certain stressors – but first, you must learn to identify them.\n\n\nHabit-building tips and strategies\n\nSmall changes repeated daily are more effective than massive changes repeated once. Implement new habits with surgical precision , and find out the easiest way to get better for years to come. Understand and manage your anxiety triggers at your own pace to always feel in control with tips and strategies that have helped thousands before you.\n\n\nWeekly assessments\n\nComplete the DASS-21 depression, anxiety, and stress self-evaluation surveys to track how your outlook changes over time. These weekly assessments are a helpful tool that will provide you with a deeper understanding of how you are feeling at the moment and guide you toward feeling better with no pressure.\n\n\nQuick relief exercises\n\nSometimes, long-term strategies are not enough, and you need help on the spot. No matter if it’s a big presentation, an aftermath of a fight, or a spiral of negative thoughts – you can put your mind to rest with quick-relief exercises. Explore stress-free activities and relax in stressful situations quickly without ever losing control.\n\nIt's time to embark on your journey\nWe are glad to be here for you and guide you on your new path. \n\nDisclaimer: Mental self-help apps like Sensa are not a replacement for or a form of therapy, nor are they intended to cure, treat, or diagnose medical conditions, including psychiatric conditions.

The thing that matters is how you interact with these emotions because even when you are happy you need to be able to let go of this happiness and not try to prolong it artificially because there will be consequences. Meditation is a perfect solution to this. It will help you to relax and calm down. Freeing yourself from emotions and thoughts is an important skill that we need to master."

      "label": "Put your diet on autopilot with Eat This Much. Tell us your diet goals, the foods you like, your budget, and what your schedule looks like, and we'll automatically generate a complete meal plan to meet your targets. It's like having a personal diet assistant.\n\nWe offer both free accounts and premium accounts. As a free user, you can create a day's meal plan and completely customize it however you want. Each meal can have different preferences, and your nutrition targets can be whatever you like.\n\nAs a premium user, we'll automatically generate a week of meal plans and send them to you with a grocery list via email. As you follow the plans, you can track what you did or didn't eat, and if you deviate from the plans, we make it easy to readjust your targets for the next week to stay on track. Try out the free account to see if our meal plans appeal to you, and upgrade when you're ready.\n\n- Follow any eating style or create your own (works for keto, paleo, vegetarian, vegan, and more)\n- Hit your macros and calorie targets every day\n- Empower yourself with automatic control over your diet\n- Take the anxiety out of picking what to eat\n- Personalize any of our recipes and they'll replace the original\n- Reduce food waste\n- Don't like our suggestions? Easily swap them out or configure the generator to only use foods you like\n- Manage your virtual pantry (with a premium account)\n\nNormal calorie trackers force you to add foods into your diary one by one. And by the end of the day, there's no guarantee that you'll be anywhere near the nutrition targets you're trying to reach. With our automatic planner, there's nothing to track because everything is already entered for you, and all you have to do is follow the plan.\n\n\nSubscription options:\n- You can download the app for free and create/customize as many unique meal plans as you want, and save one to your account.\n- To unlock the features of Eat This Much Premium, you can subscribe for either the monthly or yearly description.\n\nAuto-renew details:\n- The price to subscribe in your currency will be shown in the app before confirming the subscription.\n- After the free trial has ended, payment will be charged to your iTunes Account.\n- Your subscription will auto-renew unless cancelled 24 hours before the end of the current period (the auto-renew will continue with the same frequency that you select, either the monthly price for the  monthly subscription or yearly price for the yearly subscription).\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the same price you initially paid.\n- Auto-renew can be turned off at any time from your iTunes Account Settings.\n- If you cancel your subscription or turn off auto renew in the middle of a billing cycle your account will remain premium until the end of that cycle.\n\nApple health integration:\nApple health syncing can be enabled in Settings -> Apple Health -> Enable Apple Health syncing for Premium users.\n\nWhen Apple Health is enabled:\n- your weight will automatically import and export when you login and when you view your user profile\n- nutrition information will automatically export for meals marked \"I ate this\" when they are first viewed in the app and as you edit them\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.eatthismuch.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of use: https://www.eatthismuch.com/terms/"

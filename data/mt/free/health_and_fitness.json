In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix.

      "label": "Joggo is a running training app that helps people reach their running goals. Whether you want to: \n\n- Cross a specific distance or pace target\n- Manage your weight \n- Relax your mind\n\n\nThe Joggo app is built on 3 main pillars: Personalized Training, Education, and Motivation. Each pillar represents a set of features in our app that helps people achieve even the most ambitious goals.\n\n\nPersonalized training plans from beginners to pros: \nEvery user is asked to fill a quiz used to determine the underlying motivation for starting to run, the risk factors one might have, and personal goals. We then ask the user to have the first free run, which we track to determine actual fitness level and running capabilities, set the starting mark, and create a personalized training plan.\n\n\nBi-weekly running plan adjustments based on progress and feedback\nEven if the starting point is the same, two people will have very different progress in just two weeks. We acknowledge the differences and create a running program based on 2 weeks’ running streaks. Afterward, we re-evaluate your progress and feedback on your well-being. If you believe you can accomplish more, we then increase the intensity for the following 2 weeks’ running streaks. It is important to monitor your progress but not overdo it. \n\n\nTimely educational bits – right knowledge at the right time\nToo much information could be overwhelming, especially in the beginning. The right information at the right time could be a factor that determines if you continue running or burn yourself out and quit  altogether. Our focus is to give timely bits of information right when you need it the most. As you progress, our content will progress with you to cover more advanced topics and get gradually grounded into the intricacies of running, sports, health, and nutrition.\n\n\nGet rewarded for the effort and level up\nWe want to let you know that you are doing a great job. Despite the speed, distance, body shape, or gear – you are on the right track if you are running. Every run is rewarded with points that allow you to compare your effort with someone else and see how well you are doing. \n\n\nWith an additional purchase:\nConsultation Bundle: Get personal consultations with our elite running coaches and top nutritionists. Whether you need a coach to run better or a nutritionist to guide you toward a healthier life, our experts will be right here to support and help you keep going.\n\nWorkout Plan: Get a full-body workout guide with video tutorials and detailed instructions for your lower, upper body, and core. Created by our top sports specialists, this exercise plan is a “roadmap” that identifies the steps you need to take to reach your desired destination.\n\nJoggo works with Apple Health to sync workouts data.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Please seek a doctor’s advice in addition to using this app and before making any medical decisions.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://joggo.run/en/data-protection-policy/\nGeneral conditions: https://joggo.run/en/general-conditions"

      "label": "Hypnotize yourself to relieve pain and stress, improve your sleep, and build better habits. Reveri's self-hypnosis can help you anywhere in just a few minutes. \n\nBACKED BY SCIENCE\n\nDr. David Spiegel, Associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine, is a psychiatrist who has taught more than 7,000 people how to better manage their minds and bodies using hypnosis. David is also Reveri's Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, bringing more than 45 years of clinical and research experience studying stress, pain, sleep, and hypnosis. He has written thirteen books, 404 scientific journal articles, and 170 book chapters. He was educated at Harvard and Yale and now teaches at Stanford. He created Reveri so that you can tap his expertise, change your mind and mind your body.\n\nCHANGE YOUR MIND\n\nUse your mind to better control your body. Reveri's focused self-hypnosis sessions cover a range of challenges like insomnia, stress, focus, pain perception, eating habits, and quitting smoking.\n\n\nWHAT IS SELF-HYPNOSIS?\n\nIn plain terms, self-hypnosis is just a naturally occurring state of highly focused attention.\n\nHave you ever gotten so caught up in a good movie or a play or a novel that you think you're in the fictional world and forget about the world around you?\n\nThat's what self-hypnosis is like.\n\nWhen you use a telephoto lens or pinch to zoom way in on a picture on your phone - you get to see incredible detail of a very specific area, but you become less aware of the surrounding context.\n\nThat's what self-hypnosis is like.\n\nMany people fear that hypnosis is a loss of control. In reality, hypnosis is a means of increasing your control over your mind and body. Our minds are powerful tools, and most of us can learn how to use them more effectively. Hypnosis gives us a pathway to alter the relationship between mind and body.\n\nREVERI MEMBERSHIP\n\nPaying Reveri members will receive:\n- Access to the complete Reveri experience\n- Self-hypnosis sessions for quitting smoking, eating well, managing pain, relieving stress, improving sleep, enhancing focus\n- Short sessions that can be used frequently to help build the concentration muscle\n\nPrices are for customers in this country. Pricing in other countries may vary and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on your country of residence.\n\nYour iTunes account will be charged at confirmation of purchase for the entire term of the plan you choose. The subscription will automatically renew unless turned off in your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the current period ends. You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings after purchase. Our 1-month and 1-year subscription plans renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Refunds will not be provided for any unused portion of a subscription term.\n\nReveri teaches the self-hypnosis skill. Nothing in the Reveri App should be considered medical advice. Users seeking medical advice should consult with their doctor or other medical professionals. Reveri does not consider the Reveri app a prescriptive device, given that there are no misleading or false medical claims in the accompanying promotional literature. Reveri provides adequate directions for lay use. The hypnosis exercises recordings labeled only for behavior modification, self-improvement, habit correction, learning technique and simple relaxation are not considered to be devices unless they are also labeled for medical or therapeutic use, per Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 335.300 Hypnotherapy Devices -Self Hypnotic Tape Recordings last revised on 08/28/12.\n\nRead our terms and conditions here:  https://www.reveri.com/terms-of-service\nRead our privacy policy here:  https://www.reveri.com/privacy-policy"

We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises. If you have any suggestions, let us know. If you want to stay updated, get useful fitness tips or if you need motivation: follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPRO SUBSCRIPTION\nTo unlock the full app you can subscribe to our PRO membership.

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

It is developed by the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication FOITT on behalf of the Federal Office of Public Health.\n\nThe app allows you to check whether a COVID certificate issued in Switzerland or the EU is valid in Switzerland.\n\nHow the app works\n\nA button on the home screen activates the smartphone camera and the app is ready to capture the QR code.\n\nSimply position the QR code on the paper or on the mobile phone shown with a holder app in the square displayed and the QR will be captured automatically.\n\nImmediately afterwards, the system performs an automatic check concerning Swiss validity rules.\n\n- A tick and a green background indicate that the presented certificate is valid.\n- An exclamation mark and a red background indicate that the presented certificate is not valid.\n- A question mark and an orange background indicate that the check failed.\n\nIn addition, the full name and date of birth of the certificate holder are displayed. These details are to be compared with the identification document presented.\n\nData protection is a top priority\n\nThe data concerning COVID certificates and checking processes is not stored. COVID certificates are protected by a digital signature and are thus forgery-proof.\n\nThe use of the app is limited to Switzerland and is subject to Swiss law."

      "label": "Breathing is a vital function of our organism - we usually breathe so automatically and so thoughtlessly, so we rarely pay attention to it. Breathing plays a vital role in how you think, feel, rest and recover, and it even impacts your posture and movement. However, focusing on our breathing can be really helpful in uncomfortable and tense situations. The entire process  \nfrom the inhalation  to exhalation  is known as a breathing (or respiration) cycle.\n\nYour respiratory system brings oxygen into your body and helps to remove carbon dioxide. Your lungs are part of your respiratory system. They sit in your chest, protected by your ribcage. Problems with your respiratory system can reduce the oxygen that reaches your lungs, which can make you unwell.\n\nDeep: respiratory rate monitor is a powerful tool for influencing individual health and well-being.\n\nDeep turns your attention to your breath,  focuses on breathing and measures your respiratory rate.  \nThe act of breathing — the movement pattern that powers respiration — is actually a voluntary movement that you can control at will. And because of respiration’s paramount role in keeping you alive, the quality of your breathing can impact virtually all other systems of the body. \n\nDeep helps you to actively use your breathing to positively affect your health and wellness on many levels.\n\nThe app features 4 sections:\n1.GENERAL HEALTH\n2.FOCUS & CALM\n3.ANTISTRESS\n4.IMPROVE SLEEP\n\nChange your breath, change your life.\n\nEXERCISES’ BENEFITS INCLUDE:\nFocus the mind \nSupport  lungs and respiratory functions\nClear the energetic channels\nRejuvenate the nervous system\nRemove toxins\nSettle stress\nMaintain body temperature\nSlow heartbeat \nLower blood pressure and heart rate\nIncrease the strength of the diaphragm\nRelax, lowering the harmful effects of the stress hormone cortisol on the body\nRelieve pain\nPromote sleep\nCope with panic and stress when feeling overwhelmed. \nHelp to sleep when  having insomnia.\nControl hyperventilation \nCalm and regulate the autonomic nervous system (ANS)\nRefocus when  having a busy or stressful day\nEase panic and worry\nDecrease headaches or migraines\nReduce symptoms of anxiety\nImprove cognitive abilities\nManage cravings\nControl or reduce anger responses\nDecreases fatigue\nReduce aggressive behavior in adolescent males\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\n\nDeep:respiratory rate monitor offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n\n- 3 days free + $12.99 per month\n- $ 59.99 per year\n- $129.99 per lifetime\n\nThese prices are for United States customers in US dollars.

In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

The Maltese adaptation has been led to by a working group of professional advisors including psychologists, IT experts and other professionals in the field. Amendments from the original app have been initiated to make the app most relevant to the Maltese context, including vital feedback from young people in Malta facilitated through a number of focus groups. There has also been key collaboration with the key providers of state mental health services in Malta to ensure the app will appropriately address all relevant needs and provides the contact details to all appropriate services.\n\nThe freely accessible app is a mental health promotion and suicide app mobile phone application which will be available both in English and Maltese. It seeks to address the mental health needs of a range of young people in Malta (particularly in the 16-24 age group), providing those from all social settings with access to an app which can support them in mood identification, monitoring, management and modification. It provides appropriate activities to reduce distress, alleviate low moods and resources for monitoring their wellbeing and as well as in accessing local support services depending on the severity of their mental health challenges.\n\nDisclaimer:\nSafeSpace is not a replacement or substitute for professional medical, psychotherapeutic, counselling or other forms of intervention provided by professionals or other service providers. \n\nSafeSpace has made every effort to ensure that information on this site is reliable and accurate at the time of publishing.

The difficulty lies in the journey – not the directions. This is an app where access to fitness-related information is immediately accessible and easily digested. There is no need for bloated videos or hyper marketing, just direct access to what you need to achieve your fitness goals.\n\nThis app allows you to centre in on any body part, for example, the chest, and will give you a number of exercises which will train that body part. Information is presented in both gif and descriptive form to enable an easy understanding of the exercise.\n\nAdditionally, there are tools to allow you to calculate macros and count calories in line with your goals.\n\nNOTE: This app downloads the videos to your phone as you load them. Please do so on WiFi as this may use your data plan."

It is completely free to download and all of the content is available for free.\n\n===========================================\nPlum Village: Zen Guided Meditation App – Main Categories\n===========================================\n\nThe Plum Village app is split into four easy-to-use categories – meditations, talks, resources, and bells of mindfulness:\n\nMEDITATIONS\n\nMeditation is a deep practice that helps us generate peace and calm, master our mind, develop a healthy headspace, and get deep insights into ourselves and the world around us.\n\nMeditations include deep relaxations, guided contemplations, silent meditations, and eating meditations. Whether you have a little time or a lot, and whether you want to be on your cushion or applying mindfulness in your daily life, there are meditations to nourish, inspire, and incorporate into your daily routine.\n\nTALKS\n\nListen and learn from the wisdom of Thich Nhat Hanh: in question-and-response format, or full-length teachings.\nAsk Thay includes hundreds of real-life questions asked to the Zen Master, like “How can we let go of anger? and “How can I stop worrying?” His answers are compassionate and infused with insight.\n\nDharma Talks are teachings given by Thich Nhat Hanh on how to bring Buddhist wisdom and mindfulness into our life. Rather than discussing theoretical concepts, he focuses on direct and clear teachings to relieve suffering and create happiness in our day to day lives.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nIn Resources you can find a library of daily practices, chants, poems, and songs. These bring to life the practices taught in Plum Village monasteries around the world and offer ways to bring mindfulness into our world, wherever we are. \n\nBELL OF MINDFULNESS\n\nIn Plum Village monasteries bells of mindfulness chime at regular intervals. Everybody stops and takes three mindful breaths to pause from their thinking or talking, breathe, and return to their bodies. The Bell of Mindfulness allows us to have the same reminder on our phone.\n\nWe can customize the bell to chime at different time periods. Settings include:\n• Start time / End time\n• Chime intervals\n• Bell volume\n• Daily repeating schedule\n\nRegular use of the Bell of Mindfulness will cultivate more calm and relaxation in your life.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nWhy not give the Plum Village app a try and see how you can benefit from it? The app is a digital companion on your mindfulness journey. Created as a gift to the world, this free app contains invaluable resources to guide you towards inner peace and freedom.\n\nDownload today for free!"

      "label": "Face yoga, or facial exercises, work by strengthening specific muscle groups to keep the skin on top plump and firm. Reduce wrinkles and get rid of headaches? Seems like the perfect solution! In addition, a study published last year found that facial exercises can even improve your mental health. \r\n\r\nAs you get older, facial muscles will naturally begin to lose elasticity and flexibility, which leads to wrinkles and a saggy appearance. Face yoga strengthens the 55 muscles of your face and is a great alternative to common anti-aging remedies. The yoga techniques are designed to stimulate collagen and elastin production in the middle layer of the skin, giving you smoother, tighter-looking skin and a more radiant complexion. If you practice face yoga regularly, it can smooth your wrinkles, lift eyes, reduce puffiness, tone cheeks, firm jawlines and create a healthy glow. Doing our face yoga exercises once or twice a day, you will see results faster than you think.\r\n\r\nWe collected for you the most fabulous anti-aging face yoga exercises. They may seem unusual sometimes, but face yoga is one of the biggest recent anti-aging trends. Check it out and see for yourself, how they make your face look firm and healthy!"

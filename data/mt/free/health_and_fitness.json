      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Chinese cuisine is a huge part of their culture. Due to the historical power of China, Chinese culinary has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Most chinese dish plates will include one staple such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu, along with utensils such as chopsticks and the wok.\n\nThe preference for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic groups. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial, royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisines. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.\n\nWe present 1000s of Chinese based diet recipes that you can search from and include the macros, calories, and nutrient count for each recipe along with ingredients and instructions."

When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n\nTo have access to the \"I am Premium\" content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

      "label": "NC° Birth Control · NC° Plan Pregnancy\n\n○ The #1 Rated Birth Control & Ovulation Temperature Tracker App in the US & UK\n○ Subscription-based to protect your data. We will never sell your personal data.\n○ The only birth control app cleared by the FDA and CE marked as a medical device\n○ Adaptive tracker technology that uses your unique cycle and basal temperature to track ovulation so you know exactly when you're fertile, and what days you can and cannot get pregnant\n○ Daily insights into your fertility and personal ovulatory pattern to help with your birth control or natural family planning needs\n○ Scientifically proven to be effective: 93% effective with typical use, and 98% effective with perfect use\n○ Switch modes and use to plan a pregnancy. Great for couples to follow ovulation and trying to conceive \n\nNatural Cycles is not just a period or basal body temperature tracker. Most other fertility tracking apps assume your cycle is 28 days long. This means the fertile window they give you is not tailored to you. Our algorithm significantly reduces the risk of you being assigned an incorrect fertile day as it uses your personal data. This reduces the risk of unwanted pregnancy, or can help you plan pregnancy and conceive with greater precision. \n\nBIRTH CONTROL, FERTILITY & OVULATION TRACKING PRICING PLANS \n○ Yearly Plan (Recommended): $99.99/year.\n○ Monthly Plan: $12.99/month.\n○ A subscription is needed to use the сycle tracker, and while a free demo is available, we recommend a minimum of 2-3 cycles for Natural Cycles to be most effective.\n○ We charge a subscription in order to protect you and your data. Free apps need to make money, so many of them do so by sharing or selling their users’ data to third parties for advertising. We will never sell your data because our users' privacy is paramount to us.\n\nPRECAUTIONS\n○ Natural Cycles fertility tracker does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Use a condom to protect against STIs.\n○ No method of birth control is 100% effective, even when using the birth control app perfectly you can still get pregnant.\n○ Natural Cycles is for women over the age of 18.\n○ Natural Cycles is only available as a method of birth control in the US and in Europe.\n○ To use Natural Cycles, you need to understand English or one of the supported languages.\n\nNatural Cycles is not just a period and ovulation tracker app, but your fertility partner that can meet your needs, at any cycle or life stage. Still not sure? Download the app and test out our Demo Mode. The app supports syncing with Apple Health. \n\n*E.

      "label": "Joggo is a running training app that helps people reach their running goals. Whether you want to: \n\n- Cross a specific distance or pace target\n- Manage your weight \n- Relax your mind\n\n\nThe Joggo app is built on 3 main pillars: Personalized Training, Education, and Motivation. Each pillar represents a set of features in our app that helps people achieve even the most ambitious goals.\n\n\nPersonalized training plans from beginners to pros: \nEvery user is asked to fill a quiz used to determine the underlying motivation for starting to run, the risk factors one might have, and personal goals. We then ask the user to have the first free run, which we track to determine actual fitness level and running capabilities, set the starting mark, and create a personalized training plan.\n\n\nBi-weekly running plan adjustments based on progress and feedback\nEven if the starting point is the same, two people will have very different progress in just two weeks. We acknowledge the differences and create a running program based on 2 weeks’ running streaks. Afterward, we re-evaluate your progress and feedback on your well-being. If you believe you can accomplish more, we then increase the intensity for the following 2 weeks’ running streaks. It is important to monitor your progress but not overdo it. \n\n\nTimely educational bits – right knowledge at the right time\nToo much information could be overwhelming, especially in the beginning. The right information at the right time could be a factor that determines if you continue running or burn yourself out and quit  altogether. Our focus is to give timely bits of information right when you need it the most. As you progress, our content will progress with you to cover more advanced topics and get gradually grounded into the intricacies of running, sports, health, and nutrition.\n\n\nGet rewarded for the effort and level up\nWe want to let you know that you are doing a great job. Despite the speed, distance, body shape, or gear – you are on the right track if you are running. Every run is rewarded with points that allow you to compare your effort with someone else and see how well you are doing. \n\n\nWith an additional purchase:\nConsultation Bundle: Get personal consultations with our elite running coaches and top nutritionists. Whether you need a coach to run better or a nutritionist to guide you toward a healthier life, our experts will be right here to support and help you keep going.\n\nWorkout Plan: Get a full-body workout guide with video tutorials and detailed instructions for your lower, upper body, and core. Created by our top sports specialists, this exercise plan is a “roadmap” that identifies the steps you need to take to reach your desired destination.\n\nJoggo works with Apple Health to sync workouts data.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Please seek a doctor’s advice in addition to using this app and before making any medical decisions.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://joggo.run/en/data-protection-policy/\nGeneral conditions: https://joggo.run/en/general-conditions"

Each audio has been specifically designed to destroy all the facets of your addiction to smoking so that you can enjoy a happier, healthier and smoke free life.\n\nHypnosis is a powerful tool, but it still can sometimes need complimentary therapy or counseling sessions in conjunction with this.

Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

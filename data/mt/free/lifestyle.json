      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Even if you're an Aries Sun, a Libra moon or a Virgo rising change everything. \n\n> \"Banging astrology app.\" Dua Lipa\n> \"The planets have aligned to bring you hip af horoscopes.\" Girlboss\n> \"Download it if astrology is part of your aesthetic.\" Refinery29\n\nCo–Star's predictions are based on a map of the sky at your exact time and place of birth, coupled with NASA data to track the planets as they move.

Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

      "label": "The MyKi application works with the following model smartwatches: MyKi 4, МyKi 4 LITE, MyKi Watch and MyKi Touch. MyKi devices have the following functionalities: two-way calls, an SOS button, parental control and chat features. Using GPS, А-GPS, Wi-Fi and LBS technology, MyKi devices can provide real-time positioning. Depending on the model MyKi smartwatch, functionalities may vary.\nThe MyKi application features include:\nLocalization:\nYou can check the current location of your child wearing a MyKi watch at any time. Depending on the smartwatch model, the devices use 2G or 4G/LTE technology, GPS, A-GPS, Wi-Fi and LBS technology to guarantee accurate real-time localization. Browse through the history to track the device's locations for the past month.\nSafe zones function:\nYou can set up to five Safe Zones using a radius from 50 m - 5km, in which you know your child is secure. You will receive a push notification immediately in case the device enters or leaves the perimeter of the Safe zone. An additional Wi-Fi Safe zone can be set to notify you if your child leaves the Wi-Fi area.\nCommunication functions:\nYou can call the Watch by adding your phone number into the Watch's phone book supported in the MyKi application. Send voice and text messages to your child using the Chat menu in the application. The child may reply with a voice message, a phone call or a video call, depending on the MyKi smartwatch model.\nActivity function:\nThis function tracks the movements of your child and, based on standard measures, brings back information for the number of steps, passed distance in meters, and burned calories during the day. Depending on the MyKi smartwatch model, goals for distance travelled and active time could be set through the app to stimulate the daily movement activities of the child.\nOther functions:\nPush Notifications\nDo not disturb mode\nSet sound mode, Ringtone, or Silent mode\nAlarm function\nShare the device with other accounts\n---------------------------\nПриложението MyKi работи с часовниците MyKi 4, МyKi 4 LITE, MyKi Watch и MyKi Touch. Интелигентните часовници MyKi поддържат двупосочни разговори, SOS бутон, родителски контрол и функция за чат. Използвайки GPS, A-GPS, Wi-Fi и LBS, MyKi часовниците могат да осигурят точно позициониране в реално време. В зависимост от модела MyKi часовник, функциите могат да се различават.\nОсновни функции на приложението MyKi:\n•\tЛокализация:\nС помощта на MyKi часовниците можете да проверите местоположението на Вашето дете в реално време. В зависимост от модела, устройствата MyKi използват 2G или 4G/LTE технология, GPS, A-GPS, Wi-Fi и LBS, за да осигурят точно позициониране в реално време. Прегледайте историята на местоположенията, за да проследите локациите на устройството за последния месец.\n•\tБезопасни зони:\nМожете да настроите до пет безопасни зони, с радиус от 50м до 5 км, в които знаете, че детето Ви е защитено. Непосредствено при влизане или напускане на безопасната зона, ще получите нотификация. Може да бъде настроена допълнително Wi-Fi безопасна зона, която да Ви уведомява, когато детето Ви напусне зоната на Wi-Fi мрежата.\n•\tКомуникация:\nМожете да се обадите на часовника, като добавите телефонния си номер в телефонния указател на устройството, достъпен в приложението MyKi. Гласови и текстови съобщения могат да бъдат изпращани до детето, чрез менюто за чат в апликацията. Детето може да отговори с гласово съобщение, телефонно обаждане или видео обаждане в зависимост от модела на часовника MyKi.\n•\tАктивност:\nТази функция отчита движенията на Вашето дете и въз основа на стандартни метрики връща информация за броя стъпки, изминатите метри и изгорените калории през деня. В зависимост от модела MyKi устройство могат да бъдат поставяни цели за изминато разстояние и активно време, за да се стимулират ежедневните двигателни активности на детето.\nДруги функции:\n•\tИзвестия\n•\tРежим \"Не безпокойте\"\n•\tЗвукови режими\n•\tАларми\n•\tИстория на събитията\n•\tСподеляне на устройството с други акаунти"

      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use.

What's more, we prepared video tutorials that show how to do all the grooming procedures correctly.\n\n**WHAT ABOUT SUBSCRIPTIONS?**\n\nThe download and usage of the app are free of charge.

Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

      "label": "It is so much better to date a person who thinks and eats like you. You can share meals in peace and have a good time, knowing that you agree on such important things as saving the animals, protecting the environment and living a healthy lifestyle. Relationships with non-vegetarians tend to always hit some obstacles that we believe can be avoided altogether, if you find the right vegetarian match. Tired of meeting someone in a restaurant and having to explain where you get your proteins from, or why cows and fishes are living beings just like dogs? Or maybe you simply want to meet like minded people to have a happy conversation or exchange vegan recipes. Either way, that's why we created Veggly! Find, match and chat with vegetarians and vegans near you!\n\nHow does Veggly work?\n-Find nearby vegan and vegetarian singles for dating\n-Mark people you liked (or hide the ones you didn’t)\n-Have some real conversations with veggies you matched with using text or audio messages\n- We hope you will meet your veg soul mate or at least some good friends\n\nAlso:\n- Create a profile with your authentic pictures and tell people how long ago you have changed your lifestyle to kickstart a conversation\n- Search based on diet, age, distance or scan through profiles who have been online recently\n- We are open to different types of vegetarians (raw vegan, keto vegetarian etc.) and gender identities\n\nA few testimonials\n- “Our story started when both of us started to scroll through Veggly. Both of us realized that the vegan dating pool is very small and we definitely didn’t expect things to turn out this well. Finding someone who is vegan is great but it obviously takes much more to fall in love and to build a good relationship. From the moment we started talking we realized how many things we have in common and how many shared interests we have.” - Charity and Joe, from Holland and the UK\n- “I’ve never had any good experiences with dating apps before but I decided to give Veggly a try. It stood out from the other apps because it was made for the vegan and vegetarian community. It was a much better experience than I could have imagined. I was pleased to see that I already have at least one core value in common with everyone on the app, which is more than what most apps currently have to offer. I’ve met my boyfriend through Veggly so I have them to thank for giving us the chance to meet, for me to fall so hopelessly and madly in love with him. I would definitely recommend Veggly if you are vegan, vegetarian, or plant based. Everyone needs to eat to live and dating is a much better experience when you can agree on something you need to do every day.” - Victoria, from Canada\n- “I’ve been a member of the app since the early stages, and in fact, recently I met my current partner through the app!  We clicked right away; we chatted and had video dates for about a month. I was traveling across the country in my self-converted van at that time, and for our first date he drove thousands of miles to meet me in Wyoming, then we traveled for about 5 weeks together!  Crazy story but I think that only happened because we met through this app.” - UX Designer, from San Francisco\n- “When I decided to stop eating meat I didn’t know many veg people who I could ask questions to. I decided to download Veggly to chat and look for a veg nutritionist referral (yes, I had that goal hahaha). I ended up meeting a guy who lived 4 blocks from my house, we started talking and we have been together for almost a year now! I never thought I would meet someone nice on a dating app because of my prejudice, but now I’m dating a nice vegan guy!  So the tip of the day is this: download Veggly! Even if you can’t find “the one”, there are plenty of nice people to meet and chat with!” - Chemist, from Brazil\n\nAvailable for premium users\n- Ads-free\n- Monthly Super Likes\n- Teleportation to any city in the world\n- See who liked you\n- Reading confirmation\n\nhttps://www.veggly.net/terms/"

If something bad happens, the system will instantly activate the sirens, notify of danger and call the security company patrol dispatch.\n\nIN THE APP:\n\n◦ Manage security modes and your smart home from anywhere in the world\n◦ Get alarm notifications\n◦ Monitor system events\n◦ View the photos taken with the detectors of the MotionCam lineup, and security camera footage\n◦ Set up devices, automation scenarios, and security schedules\n\n• • • \n\n“Intruder Alarm of the Year” — Security & Fire Excellence Awards, London\n“Security & Firefighting Risks” — silver medal at Expoprotection Awards, Paris\n“Intruder product of the year” — PSI Premier Awards 2020\n“Security System of the Year” — Ukrainian People Choice Award 2021\n\n1.5 million people in 130 countries are protected by Ajax.\n\n• • •\n\nAGAINST BURGLARS\nThe detectors instantly capture an intruder on your property, doors or windows opening, and glass breaking. As soon as a person enters a protected area, they will be captured by the photo camera of the MotionCam detector lineup. You and the security company will know what happened.\n\nONE CLICK AND HELP IS ON THE WAY\nPress the panic button on the app, key fob, or keyboard in an emergency. Ajax will call a security company patrol dispatch or medical help and notify all system users about the danger.\n\nDETECTING FIRE AND CARBON MONOXIDE\nFire detectors notify of smoke and temperature spike and promptly alert about a dangerous carbon monoxide (CO) concentration with no color, smell, or taste. The built-in sirens will wake up even those who are fast asleep.\n\nINFORMING ABOUT FLOODING\nThe detectors notify of a pipe break, a washing machine leak, or an overflowing bathtub. The system will inform users, while scenarios with relays automatically turn off the water. And if the upstairs neighbors flood your apartment, you will get the app notification. \n\nVIDEO CAMERA IN THE SMARTPHONE \nWatch video from security cameras directly in the app. Connecting the Dahua, Uniview, Hikvision, and Safire cameras and DVRs takes a minute. Equipment from other manufacturers is connected via an RTSP link.\n\nSMART HOME\nChange security modes up to a schedule, program the outdoor lighting to turn on when strangers are detected on your property, or implement an anti-flood system. Manage gates, electric locks, lighting, heating, and electrical appliances. In the app, automatically by scenario or by pressing a smart button.\n\nPROFESSIONAL LEVEL OF RELIABILITY\nThe hub runs on OS Malevich, protected from failures, viruses, and cyberattacks. Thanks to the backup battery and communication channels, the system is resistant to power outages or the lack of Internet connectivity. The account is protected by session control and two-factor authentication. Ajax has been rated Grade 2 by five independent labs.\n\nCONNECTING TO THE SECURITY COMPANY MONITORING STATION\n3,500 security companies in 130 countries work with the Ajax security systems.\n\n• • •\n\nAjax equipment is required to work with the app. You can buy the devices from authorized Ajax partners in your region.\n\nLearn more: www.ajax.systems\n\nHave any questions?

      "label": "Business leaders, athletes and success coaches are all known to use visualization techniques to continuously SUCCEED & WIN!\n \nYOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO SUCCEED \nHigher Self Vision Board will give you the focus and consistent reminders to stay with and achieve your goals. It can help you transform into a better version of yourself, and eventually into the best version of yourself.\n \nManifestation Higher Self Vision Board's affirmation & visualization technique uses subliminal messaging, which is faster and more effective than a regular vision board. It bypasses your conscious mind and works directly with your subconscious by using rapid-fire images together with carefully worded positive affirmations. Your reality is malleable by patterns of thought. Manifestation Higher Self Vision Board helps you reprogram your mind and create the reality you want! Anyone willing to reprogram their thought patterns can benefit from this app. \n \n* * * * * * * * *\nIMPORTANT: \nWhen pressing the play button, the app will flash your Vision Board images faster than you can consciously see them. Each image will only display for several milliseconds. This super rapid image flashing is how the app is meant to work.\n \n \n   — ANYONE —\n\t•\tFocus on your health and well-being\n\t•\tManifest financial opportunities\n\t•\tManifest love into your life\n\t•\tManifest travel opportunities or interesting experiences\n\t•\tManifest gifts for your loved ones and yourself\n\t•\tAchieve your wildest dreams!\n\t•\tManifest the life YOU want to live that's just perfect for YOU\n\t•\tExperiment & Succeed!\n\n\n   — LEADERS & ENTREPRENEURS —\n\t•\tManifest the business opportunity you’ve been thinking about\n\t•\tShift your reality and guide it on a positive path\n\t•\tLead successful meetings and win your audience\n\t•\tGet the approvals you need or bypass them\n\t•\tLaunch your product successfully\n\t•\tExpand your knowledge\n\t•\tConquer obsessive thoughts, mental rut and gain control of your mind\n\t•\tCreate beneficial business relationships\n\t•\tAttract and work with top level people \n\t•\tManifest financial opportunities\n\t•\tThink like there is no box\n \n\n   — COLLEGE STUDENTS —\n\t•\tManifest interesting experiences\n\t•\tCreate positive and meaningful relationships\n\t•\tCreate financial opportunities\n\t•\tRealize your life’s passions\n\t•\tMake your talent shine!\n\t•\tMake the team & win the game!\n\t•\tFocus, study & ace your exams\n\t•\tLove yourself!\n\t•\tWin a scholarship\n\n \n DID YOU KNOW …\nYour subconscious can't tell the difference between a dream and reality? That's why dreams feel so real. Conversely, it is also why people who use visualization techniques for success like 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps can achieve such amazing feats. What your subconscious mind sees it perceives as real.\n \nRECENT RESEARCH REVEALS …\n\nUp to 95% of your behavior is being controlled by your subconscious mind. That leaves a measly 5% for your conscious mind - the part of you that is reading this right now. Your subconscious regulates your belief systems, your self-confidence, your perception of the world and the reality you live in. Why not use this much more powerful part of your mind to manifest your dreams? \n \n \n \n   — RECENT REVIEWS —\n \n  * * * * * \nSuch a beautiful app! \nI’ve had this app for years, and several things have come to fruition! Simple to create and simple to add into my daily routine.\n \n  * * * * * \nExcellent app that is easy to navigate and brings my vision to life! I've manifested a handful of goals that I wasn’t entirely sure were possible and/or just how quickly those blessings would enter my life but they did. This app helped me to stay focused, committed and encouraged to reach those goals.\n \n \n \nSocial Links — \nInstagram: \n@higher_self_vision\n\n \nContact — \npixelexport@gmail.com\n \nTerms — \nhttp://kailani.studio/digital-vision-board-terms-of-use\n \nPrivacy Policy — \nhttp://kailani.studio/digital-vision-board-privacy-policy\n \n \nThank you for using my app. Happy dream manifesting!\n- Kate (Designer & Developer)"

      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Here's a tip: You might not even need to buy a real CCTV camera, baby monitor, IP cam or IP webcam. \n\nBesides the cost of the equipment, these smart home appliances often charge a monthly fee. With security apps like Alfred, there is no complicated installation, IP settings, or contract. You only have to download Alfred to repurpose your old devices as a DIY WiFi Camera or baby monitor: pure and simple. \n\nThe best home surveillance camera you can ever find: Free, reliable, versatile and easy to use. No hidden upfront costs or astronomical monitoring fees. Alfred is also an essential component of any home improvement or home automation project if you are interested in building a smart home or experimenting with Google Assistant. \n\nEveryone is taking advantage of their unused smartphones by turning them into video players, GPS navigators, or fitness devices. So why not use yours as a baby cam, nanny cam, pet cam, webcam or IP cam?\n\n\nAlfred Premium, a subscription service, charges 3.99 USD/month. It offers HD viewing, recording, as well as ad removal. At the confirmation of upgrade, the payment will be charged to your iTunes Account. The account will be automatically charged for renewal unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the current subscription expires.

Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound!

Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

The app is completely free and offers unlimited countdowns and count-ups!\n\nCountdown makes it easy to track the dates that matter to you – whether it be your birthday, graduation, anniversary, wedding, retirement, or something entirely else. At any point in time, you can open the app to see the number of days that are left until (or have passed since) your event. You can also turn on notifications, so that when the end date is approaching you get reminders sent to your device. \n\nThe app lets you personalize each countdown with custom themes and backgrounds. You may also move the countdown timer around the screen. If you are particularly excited about a countdown, you can easily save it to your Photo Library and share it with your friends.\n\nWe are continuously working to add new exciting functionality to the app. At the moment, the key features of the app are the following.\n\n• Create an unlimited number of countdowns and count-ups.\n• Choose between light or dark theme for each countdown timer.\n• Pick background images from your Photo Library.\n• Drag the countdown timer to place it wherever you want on the screen.\n• Hide the toolbar to leave more space to your countdown.\n• Count down to a specific time of the target date.\n• Receive reminders when upcoming events are approaching.\n• Save countdowns to your Photo Library without any UI or watermarks.\n\nWe would love to hear what you think of the app. Please take a moment and write us a review!"

      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

      "label": "The MyKi application works with the following model smartwatches: MyKi 4, МyKi 4 LITE, MyKi Watch and MyKi Touch. MyKi devices have the following functionalities: two-way calls, an SOS button, parental control and chat features. Using GPS, А-GPS, Wi-Fi and LBS technology, MyKi devices can provide real-time positioning. Depending on the model MyKi smartwatch, functionalities may vary.\nThe MyKi application features include:\nLocalization:\nYou can check the current location of your child wearing a MyKi watch at any time. Depending on the smartwatch model, the devices use 2G or 4G/LTE technology, GPS, A-GPS, Wi-Fi and LBS technology to guarantee accurate real-time localization. Browse through the history to track the device's locations for the past month.\nSafe zones function:\nYou can set up to five Safe Zones using a radius from 50 m - 5km, in which you know your child is secure. You will receive a push notification immediately in case the device enters or leaves the perimeter of the Safe zone. An additional Wi-Fi Safe zone can be set to notify you if your child leaves the Wi-Fi area.\nCommunication functions:\nYou can call the Watch by adding your phone number into the Watch's phone book supported in the MyKi application. Send voice and text messages to your child using the Chat menu in the application. The child may reply with a voice message, a phone call or a video call, depending on the MyKi smartwatch model.\nActivity function:\nThis function tracks the movements of your child and, based on standard measures, brings back information for the number of steps, passed distance in meters, and burned calories during the day. Depending on the MyKi smartwatch model, goals for distance travelled and active time could be set through the app to stimulate the daily movement activities of the child.\nOther functions:\nPush Notifications\nDo not disturb mode\nSet sound mode, Ringtone, or Silent mode\nAlarm function\nShare the device with other accounts\n---------------------------\nПриложението MyKi работи с часовниците MyKi 4, МyKi 4 LITE, MyKi Watch и MyKi Touch. Интелигентните часовници MyKi поддържат двупосочни разговори, SOS бутон, родителски контрол и функция за чат. Използвайки GPS, A-GPS, Wi-Fi и LBS, MyKi часовниците могат да осигурят точно позициониране в реално време. В зависимост от модела MyKi часовник, функциите могат да се различават.\nОсновни функции на приложението MyKi:\n•\tЛокализация:\nС помощта на MyKi часовниците можете да проверите местоположението на Вашето дете в реално време. В зависимост от модела, устройствата MyKi използват 2G или 4G/LTE технология, GPS, A-GPS, Wi-Fi и LBS, за да осигурят точно позициониране в реално време. Прегледайте историята на местоположенията, за да проследите локациите на устройството за последния месец.\n•\tБезопасни зони:\nМожете да настроите до пет безопасни зони, с радиус от 50м до 5 км, в които знаете, че детето Ви е защитено. Непосредствено при влизане или напускане на безопасната зона, ще получите нотификация. Може да бъде настроена допълнително Wi-Fi безопасна зона, която да Ви уведомява, когато детето Ви напусне зоната на Wi-Fi мрежата.\n•\tКомуникация:\nМожете да се обадите на часовника, като добавите телефонния си номер в телефонния указател на устройството, достъпен в приложението MyKi. Гласови и текстови съобщения могат да бъдат изпращани до детето, чрез менюто за чат в апликацията. Детето може да отговори с гласово съобщение, телефонно обаждане или видео обаждане в зависимост от модела на часовника MyKi.\n•\tАктивност:\nТази функция отчита движенията на Вашето дете и въз основа на стандартни метрики връща информация за броя стъпки, изминатите метри и изгорените калории през деня. В зависимост от модела MyKi устройство могат да бъдат поставяни цели за изминато разстояние и активно време, за да се стимулират ежедневните двигателни активности на детето.\nДруги функции:\n•\tИзвестия\n•\tРежим \"Не безпокойте\"\n•\tЗвукови режими\n•\tАларми\n•\tИстория на събитията\n•\tСподеляне на устройството с други акаунти"

You can now use this app to control your Philips Hue smart Bluetooth lights!*  \n\nOrganize your smart lights your way \nWhether you use just a few bulbs or have completely outfitted your home in Philips Hue, you can organize your smart lights with ease. Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

      "label": "THE BEST APP FOR MUSLIMS \r\nThis  Halal Scan App will help you identify the preservatives, colorings or food chemical additives if they are Halal (حلال) , Haram (حرام) or Mushbooh (مشبوه) (that is doubtful or Makrouh ). An important app for all Muslims concerned about what they eat.\r\n\r\nUse the image scanner of the Halal Scan App in order to  quickly identify (in seconds) those products that you should avoid (aim the camera well at the ingredients part of the product). \r\n \r\nIn addition, you will be able to know if this preservatives, colorants or chemical additives is allowed by the most recognized authorities in the world of food such as the European Union , American  and Australia . \r\n\r\n\r\nOur aim is to help Muslims not to worry about whether a product contains any Haram additives. Sometimes in supermarket products they contain preservatives, dyes or chemical food additives that can be marked by different names or E-codes (for example, E120 which is Haram since it comes from an insect). It is difficult for a Muslim to know all these names by heart. With Halal Scanner App  you will not have to worry as it identifies almost all the names of existing preservatives, colorants or chemical additives and shows them to you in a very simple way. \r\n \r\nYou will also discover which products are makrouh (مكروه) thanks to the scanning of the E-code or E-numbers.\r\n\r\n MAIN FUNCTIONS:  \r\n \r\n» Flexible search engine:\r\nYou can search by E-code or E-Number of preservatives, colorants or chemical additives and also by the name of the additive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n» Identify the additives in the product: \r\nLook for the ingredients part of the product and in a few seconds the E-code or E-number scanner will find what types of Halal or Haram (حلال او حرام) additives.\r\n\r\n\r\n »  Halal Image Scan: \r\nUse image scanning to identify if the product is Halal or Haram (حلال او حرام). The algorithm identifies the E-codes, E-numbers or names of additives.\r\n\r\n\r\n»  Assessment of each additive or scanned product: \r\nYou can assess whether a preservative, color or chemical additive is considered Halal  or Haram (حلال او حرام). This action helps not only us but also the Muslims of the world. And you can also rate the result of the scan and it will be analyzed by our team. Your opinion matters to us, because we are still meeting our goal of helping all Muslims in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n» Toxicity level \r\nConsult which additives are toxic or healthy for your health. In each additive you can know what level of toxicity it has.\r\n\r\n\r\n» Indication of authorizations by food associations: \r\nFor each additive you will be able to know if an additive is allowed by the authorities of Europe, the United States or Australia.\r\n\r\n» Save your history: \r\nAll the product that you are going to scan will be saved in order to be able to refer to it again or share it with your loved ones. Then in one click you will be able to communicate said information that the products are Halal (حلال) , Haram (حرام)  or Makruh (مكروه) and to be avoided if they are not halal.\r\n\r\n\r\n What is Zabihah or Dhabīḥah? \r\nAnimals like cows, sheep, chickens, etc. are Halal, but they must be Zabihah (ذَبِيْحَة) (slaughtered according to Islamic rites for Muslims) to be fit for consumption.\r\nSome chemical additives are not halal (حلال), since they come from animals that are not Zabihah or Dhabīḥah (ذَبِيْحَة), thus they are haram for the Muslim who consumes them. \r\nTo ensure that a product containing animal remains is Dhabīḥah (ذَبِيْحَة), you need to ensure that it is stamped by a trusted Muslim organization.\r\n\r\nThis app will not tell you whether a product is Zabihah or not, but what it will tell you is whether the additive contains animal remains and you based on whether you are in a Muslim country or not will know if it is halal or mushbooh."

If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

Track their location whenever you like, in real-time and without distance limits, with Weenect. You can also define a security zone and get alerted if your dog or cat leaves it.  \n\n\n**Train your pet using positive reinforcement** \nYou can use Weenect instead of a training collar to train your pet using positive methods. By making the Weenect beep or vibrate at each mealtime, your pet will learn to associate the two events with each other. You'll then be able to tell them when it's time to come home, simply by clicking in the app. \n \n**You decide the settings**\nYou can choose how often the tracker transmits its position: 30 seconds, 1 minute, 1 hour, etc. If you need to find your pet quickly at any time, you can use the super live mode, which gives you a position every 10 seconds. \n\n**Multiple views to choose from**\nOur wireless-based system allows you to GPS track your dog or cat using a choice of different modes:  \n- Multiple map types: Classic or Satellite View, High Definition and Terrain & Forest Trails. \n- Augmented reality and a compass feature, which enables you to work out which way you are facing. The compass works by telling you which direction to head to reach your pet's GPS location, as well as the distance between you.\n\n**View a history of your walks**\nIn addition to position history, the tracker also records your pet's activity and shows you its territory range. This enables you to see  the distances your pet covers and how active it is.  \n\n**Be alerted if a problem occurs**\nBy downloading and installing the Weenect app you can configure different types of alerts: \n- Entry/Exit in and from security zones \n- Low battery (two automatic alerts, one at at 30% and one at 15%)\n\n**The whole family on the same app **\nWeenect is first and foremost about the idea of family: in other words, all the people we love and want to look after and take care of. You'll therefore notice that our service is also available for children and the elderly.  \n\nOur 100% secure trackers and apps are designed in France by a team passionately dedicated to ensuring that you can take care of those who mean the most to you, while at the same time allowing them the freedom they deserve.  \n\nWe are always delighted to hear your thoughts and opinions. Our customer service, which is also based in France, is available seven days a week to answer your questions and listen to any comments or concerns you may have. You can contact us by email at family@weenect.com"

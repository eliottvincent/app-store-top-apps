      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

You don't have to purchase a clicker or a whistle, as EveryDoggy already has these as built-in features.\n\n70+ TRICKS AND GAMES\nKeep your dog mentally and physically active with 70+ tricks, games, and commands that come with clear step-by-step video instructions. Start from basic Sit, Stand, and Down and move on to advanced tricks like Photo and Spin.\n\nHEALTH DIARY\nSet reminders to never forget about vaccinations, annual check-ups, and grooming procedures (nail clipping, teeth brushing, etc.). What's more, we prepared video tutorials that show how to do all the grooming procedures correctly.\n\n**WHAT ABOUT SUBSCRIPTIONS?**\n\nThe download and usage of the app are free of charge.

At any point in time, you can open the app to see the number of days that are left until (or have passed since) your event. You can also turn on notifications, so that when the end date is approaching you get reminders sent to your device. \n\nThe app lets you personalize each countdown with custom themes and backgrounds. You may also move the countdown timer around the screen. If you are particularly excited about a countdown, you can easily save it to your Photo Library and share it with your friends.\n\nWe are continuously working to add new exciting functionality to the app. At the moment, the key features of the app are the following.\n\n• Create an unlimited number of countdowns and count-ups.\n• Choose between light or dark theme for each countdown timer.\n• Pick background images from your Photo Library.\n• Drag the countdown timer to place it wherever you want on the screen.\n• Hide the toolbar to leave more space to your countdown.\n• Count down to a specific time of the target date.\n• Receive reminders when upcoming events are approaching.\n• Save countdowns to your Photo Library without any UI or watermarks.\n\nWe would love to hear what you think of the app. Please take a moment and write us a review!"

This could be frustrating! More and more people would rather look for an NSA relationship without any emotional attachment from the start. If the relationship turns into a serious one, that could be a happy ending. If it doesn't, nothing to lose.\n\nCasualx was created to cater to people who are looking for a fling or any other casual relationships. We strive to build a diverse community for users with different sexual orientations, religions and races: black people, Asians, Latinos, gay men, lesbians, transgenders, Christians, Jewish, you name it. They all come from different countries in the world - the United States, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and Germany.\n\nAuto-renewable subscription policy:\r\n\r\nIf you choose to purchase Casualx Premium Service, payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at the confirmation of purchase.

You can now use this app to control your Philips Hue smart Bluetooth lights!*  \n\nOrganize your smart lights your way \nWhether you use just a few bulbs or have completely outfitted your home in Philips Hue, you can organize your smart lights with ease. Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control (iOS) \nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

Get yours along with the free app to start enjoying these features.\n\n\n\n\n*** Activity & Sleep Tracking ***\n\n\n\nSee how active your dog or cat is. Set goals. Compare with other pets. Spot sleep patterns, and make sure your furry friend is getting quality rest. \n\n\n\n*** LIVE Tracking ***\n\n\n\nNeed extra reassurance? Go into LIVE mode to follow your pet's every move, and get location updates every 2-3 seconds.\n\n\n\n*** Virtual Fence (Safe Zones & No-Go Zones) ***\n\n\n\nSet safe zones - like your garden - as well as no-go zones your buddy should avoid - like a field near a busy road.

You can set up several virtual fences, make them big or small, and move them easily across the map.\n\n\n\n*** Find Mode ***\n\n\n\nPinpoint your dog’s location in close range. The closer you get, the more circles fill up on your screen.

You can also share real-time location with anyone with a single tap - very useful if your pet runs off and you need help bringing them back home.\n\n\n\n*** Interactive Map ***\n\n\n\nView the location of all your pets with trackers at the same time, or zoom in on a single pet. Add all your pets with GPS trackers in the Tractive app. Switch between regular map view or satellite view. Tilt the map in 3D view by using two fingers. \n\n\n\n*** Up to 7 days battery life ***\n\n\n\nDepends on usage, coverage and how active your dog or cat is. Set up a Power Saving Zone at home to maximize battery life.\n\n\n\n\n*The Tractive GPS app works with all Tractive GPS trackers.*"

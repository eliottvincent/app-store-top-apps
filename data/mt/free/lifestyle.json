And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Plus, no more accidentally swiping left on someone you actually like and wondering if they’ll ever pop up again! With Summer, everyone nearby is laid out in front of you so you can see who catches your eye, learn more about them, and spark up a conversation.\n\nSo you might be wondering, “this sounds too good to be true; what’s the catch?” Well, there isn’t one! Summer is here to revolutionize the dating space for good. Once you send a like, that person has 24 hours to like you back or send you a message. We’re all busy- we don’t have time to wait days or even months for a match.\n\nDate more, swipe less.\n\nPrivacy: https://www.summerdating.com/privacy-policy\n\nTerms: https://www.summerdating.com/terms-of-service"

Each day, Q365 will ask you one unique question, each constructed by a professional therapist to ensure you get the most beneficial prompts. \n\nYou choose however short or long your answer is, it’s your life. \nThen, on the same day the next year, you will be asked the same question. \nSee and reflect on your past answers! Whether they be negative or positive–witness your change, stimulate mindfulness, and be reminded of precious memories. \n\n\nBENEFITS OF USING Q365 \n\nSelf-care and journaling don’t have to be a stress and take up a chunk of time for you to reap the benefits. \nQ365 allows you to track your own personalized, endless journey. Don’t let your past memories only live in the past…use them to your advantage to remember them, learn from them, and grow from them!\n\nAll you have to dedicate is 1 minute a day for your mental health, self-reflection, memory keepsakes, and personal growth. \nJust 1 minute a day for your life memories to stay. \n\nThe questions in Q365 will help you cultivate gratitude and mindfulness for the small and joyful things, for the major life milestones, for your strength in pushing through your problems, and much more. Let self-awareness and a trip down memory lane bring you happiness today.\n\nGratitude and mindfulness for all aspects of your life translate to a more confident and positive YOU; happier to notice the beautiful things in life, while also mentally stronger to deal with the challenges. \n\nLife moves too quickly sometimes for people to notice the change, let Q365 remind you of what you may have overlooked.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms and conditions: https://theq365.com/terms.html\nPrivacy policy: https://theq365.com/privacy.html"

Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more.

Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

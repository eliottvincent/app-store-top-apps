Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

When snoring is detected you will receive a notification every two seconds.\nThe notification can be configured to vibrate or make a sound on your iPhone or Apple Watch encouraging you to change your sleep position.\n\nOnce snoring isn't detected anymore the vibrations will stop automatically!\n\nGreat news!\n\nApple has approved Koala Nap for usage of Critical Alerts allowing the vibrations to override the Do Not Disturb setting!\nMake sure to allow Critical Alerts in the apps settings, and you're good to go.\n\nWe also added Siri support, allowing custom automations! \n\nKoala Naps advanced snore detection utilises the latest MACHINE LEARNING algorithms, and large data set of snoring sounds. The result is an accurate detection of snoring, ignoring non snoring background sounds, for example baby crying, motor sounds etc'.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Koala Nap is designed to detect real snoring sounds and patterns, meaning that trying to fake snoring sounds simply will not work. We recommend using it over night and check out the results in the morning. If there seems to be a problem with real snore detection, please send a support email from within the app or from our site https://www.koalanap.com.\n\nKoala Nap is GDPR compliant in the European region!\n\nDownload Koala Nap now!\n\nKoala Nap offers a 7 DAY FREE TRIAL, cancel any time within the trial period without getting billed. You only pay for Koala Nap if you find it helpful in reducing snoring, so don't be afraid to try it out.\n\n---For best results---\n\nUse the app a few times as the snore detection is based on machine learning which increases in accuracy the more the app is used. Make sure to allow uploading snore samples in the app settings, which are used for training the snore detection algorithm. \n\nTry to reduce background noise for example TV, radio or other loud devices.\n\nMake sure to enable internet when the app launches, in order to update the snore detection algorithm. Keep the app version up to date.\n\nGood and quiet night :)\n\nPrivacy policy: https://flycricket.io/koala-nap/privacy.html"

They need accurate information about the hazardous substances, the emergency resources available, and the surrounding environmental conditions to save lives and minimize the impact on the environment and physical property.

The key information presented to the user about a substance varies depending on this role, so that the information most relevant to the respective job can be quickly accessed. \n\n* Radiological and biological substance support. \n\n* Tools and reference materials, including triage tools, radiological incident support, WMD response guidelines, and an electronic version of the ERG 2016\n\n* Mobile support, providing first responders critical information where they need it, when they need it."

We may need a rash identifier, a mole checker, a skin analyzer, or an acne scanner, depending on the problem. The AI-Dermatologist app combines all these functions. We have designed this modern skin analyzer so that by using it on a regular basis, if you suspect a problem, you can contact your healthcare providers in time and avoid complications.\n\nBased on today's most advanced Artificial intelligence technologies and professional knowledge and expertise in dermatology, our application enables you to check all your skin problems for risk assessment: spots, birthmarks, acne, moles or papillomas. In 1 minute AI-Dermatologist gives a result on the next step to be taken. Likewise, AI-Dermatologist gives you the opportunity to store photos to keep track of changes over time and monitor your skin health in the long run. By creating AI-Dermatologist, we supported the idea of making skin screening and monitoring accessible to everyone.\n\nWith AI-Dermatologist you can:\n- Snapshot your skin spots, birth-marks, mole or another skin diseases such as: angioma, warts, papillomas, mollusks and etc.\n- Take / upload photos and track results for changes\n- Get a reminder when it is time to take a new photo, take pills or build a skin care routine \n- Сreate your own scheme for the medicines or cosmetics’ use according to your schedule \n- Track dynamics of baseline and follow-up results\n- Easily log the tracked your skin conditions locations on your body\n\nPlease note that AI-Dermatologist is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace or cancel a visit to your doctor. This application aims to help you be more aware of your skin condition via self-exams, but it is not an online dermatology platform. If you ever feel uncomfortable or see that your skin spot is changing, irritated, itchy or bleeding, we strongly recommend that you contact a medical specialist without hesitation to avoid the risk of melanoma or other skin diseases.\n\nBy signing up for this subscription, you agree to our\nTerms of use http://ai-derm.com/terms/terms_of_use.html\nPrivacy Policy http://ai-derm.com/privacy/privacy.html"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

The app does not store or communicate the scanned information to third parties. The app performs the verification in offline mode, i.e. without invoking a remote system service when it is used. In order to verify the certificate authenticity the app must access the backend of the DGC national platfor at least once a day, connected to the European gateway (DGCG), where all the public keys used to sign the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate” are collected.\r\n\r\nThe workflow of the VerificationC19 app is divided into the following phases:\r\n- The person who must verify the certification asks the user to show the QR code of his certificate\r\n- Using the app, the QR code is read and its authenticity is verified using the public key signing the certificate\r\n- Once the information contained in the COVID-19 Green Certification or the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate\" has been decoded, the app shows the main information:\r\n- Name, surname and date of birth of the certificate holder\r\n- Unique identifier of the certificate\r\n- Validity of the certificate\r\n- The certificate is verified against the decoded date information and the Italian rules for COVID-19 green certifications.\r\n- The person in charge proceeds to visually check the correspondence of the personal data of the holder shown by the VerificationC19 app and certificate holder ID card."

It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen.

You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

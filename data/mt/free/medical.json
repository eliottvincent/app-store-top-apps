Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

Finally, there's a pumping app for all that other stuff too.\n\nWe'll help you get set up with a simple, inexpensive DIY storage solution. Already have your own system? No problem. We work with that too.\n\nUse Milk Stash to:\n+ Log your pumping sessions.\n+ Keep track of multiple stashes across your refrigerator, freezer and deep freeze.\n+ Get notified before your milk will expire to\n+ Better plan your rotation between frozen and refrigerated milk to\n+ Maximize freshness, improving your baby's nutrition and immune system.\n+ Coordinate with your caregiver(s) to\n+ Know what's happening while you're away and pumping.\n+ See statistics on your milk supply and production/consumption rates.\n+ Hunt down food allergies by tracking what you ate for each bottle/bag you've stored.\n\nAlso:\n+ Free and ad-free.\n+ Synchronize data between multiple devices and accounts.\n+ Web application for caregivers who don't have Apple devices.\n\nMilk Stash is a labor of love by a small team in Boulder, Colorado.

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

We strive to make studying more efficient by redefining how you prepare for the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX®).\n\n* Academics’ Choice “Smart Media” award winner\n* EdTech Digest “Cool Tool” award winner\n\nThe Science Behind Mobile Learning:\nOverloading your brain with too much information at once is a common study mistake. Research has shown that smaller, more frequent study sessions are the key to knowledge retention. In other words, taking short quizzes on the go is a much more effective means of exam preparation than reading page after page in a textbook. Apps offer the benefit of interaction, which means you’re far more likely to remember a concept you engage with rather than one you’ve only read about.\n\nTake your NCLEX studies with you, no matter where life takes you.\n\nGet Started for Free:\nWe provide a limited free version so you can get a feel for the app before deciding to upgrade. The free version offers dozens of practice questions with detailed answer explanations and limited access to the Question of the Day.\n\nWant Even More Practice?\nChoose your ideal study package to gain access to our proven test bank. You'll enjoy:\n\n- Hundreds of practice questions and detailed rationales\n- Access to Question of the Day (QOTD)\n- All social media bonus questions\n- Exam Builder to create customized exams\n- Money-Back Pass Guarantee*\n- Priority in-app support\n\nPocket Prep Features:\n- No internet required\n- Study Modes: See answers as you go or at the end\n- Retake past exams with a single tap\n- Study reminders and QOTD notifications\n- Automatic test saving and retrieval\n- Detailed history and results reporting\n- Exam day countdown\n- Multi-device ready\n\nOur team of writers and editors are industry leaders who have meticulously crafted practice questions and detailed answer explanations with you in mind.

It is even easier now with a dedicated Apple Watch app. The method we use is called Active Orthostatic Test.\n\nThe tracking method is very simple - you are going to measure your lying and standing heart rates.\n• In the first phase you will lie for 5 minutes and then measure your heart rate.\n• In the second phase you will stand for 1 minute and then measure your heart rate\n\nGenerally, the lower the difference between lying and standing heart rates the better your overall heart health. Approximate ranges (please note this is not a diagnose, if you are feeling bad contact your doctor):\n• [0 - 15] Great heart health.\n• [16 - 25] Normal heart health.\n• [25+] Bad heart health.\n\nThe key to successful tests is to pass them at the same time of day regularly. You can setup notification preferences to never miss your test.\n\n--------------------\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\n\nCardian reads / writes the following data using the Health app (HealthKit).\n\nApple Watch App:\n\n- Heart Rate (Read / Write)\n- Workouts (Write)\n\n--------------------\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lfffp8ayg95pa4x/cardian_privacy_policy.pdf?dl=0\nTerms of service: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qu72a2a5a35jgqk/cardian_terms.pdf?dl=0\n\n--------------------\n\nDisclaimer:\nYOU MUST NEVER RELY ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED USING THIS APP FOR ANY DIAGNOSIS OR RECOMMENDATION FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT.

      "label": "The simplest program to track breastfeeding, pumping, bottle feeding, solid food consumption, diapers, sleep schedule, height and weight, and more.\n\nWith the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.\n\nThe birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

Download the FREE app, attempt questions and explore all the unique features (In-App purchase required to unlock the full set of 4600+ questions). \n\nAPP FEATURES:\n* Study Mode (Attempt a question, see answer and the rationale)\n* Create Quiz (Select topic, number of questions - Pause and resume anytime)\n* Time Mode (Answer as many questions as possible in a set time to improve your speed)\n* QOD (Attempt a random question every day)\n* Stats (View details on topics mastered so you can focus on weak areas)\n* Bookmarked and Skipped questions feature allows students focus on specific areas\n* BACK-UP all your stats to a cloud server and RESTORE to a different device\n\nBASED ON:\nLippincott Q&A Review for NCLEX-RN®\n\nDesigned to help pre-licensure nursing students prepare to take the licensing examination. Students and faculty also use the book as a study guide and practice tests for preparing for faculty-made examinations. The book is designed to support the four major content areas in pre-licensure programs: obstetrics, pediatrics, medical-surgical, and mental health nursing. Within each of the four sections, chapters are organized around common health problems. When studying, students can select examinations that parallel the content in a particular course in a variety of curricula. \n\nThis consistently bestselling NCLEX-RN review book features more than 5,000 high-level questions that prompt active learning and higher-order thinking. The questions support the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) 2016 RN test plan and are written in the style used on the licensing examination. Other features include the use of all the types of alternate-format questions found on the licensing examination, detailed rationale for both correct and incorrect answers, information about the NCLEX-RN, study tips, and a \"Content Mastery and Test-Taking Self Analysis\" grid by which students can chart their own progress and modify study plans as needed. \n\nKey Features\nRevision of the organization of the comprehensive tests to include tests of varying length; this will allow students to practice taking shorter and longer tests so they can estimate their concentration and fatigue level.\nAll questions reviewed and updated as needed for appropriateness for Canadian nursing practice.\nGreater emphasis on pharmacology and management of care questions (delegation, prioritization, and leadership), as per the NCLEX-RN test plan.\nAdditional questions about older adults.\nAdditional questions requiring students to make clinical decisions.\nAdherence to the NCLEX-RN 2016 test plan and Practice Analysis (to be released fall/spring 2015).\nQuestions formulated based on frequency of nursing actions as per NCSBN Practice Analysis.\nAdded information on test preparation and study plans; more information on taking computerized tests (a need identified in the Canadian market).\nColor highlights for alternate-format questions to emphasize them for students and potential adopters (students and faculty who want to be assured of availability of these types of questions). As per market review, color highlights will NOT be used in comprehensive exams to simulate more accurately the questions that are NOT highlighted on the actual NCSBN NCELX-RN exam.\nConversion grid from metric to imperial to assist students in both the United States and Canada to become familiar with these differences in measurements; all questions will be written to include both types of measurements.\nContinued use of high-level questions and teaching rationale."

      "label": "Emergency services widely use the METHANE acronym to build a report for alerting others about a major incident. The METHANE format is taught widely, and may seem easy to remember, but in a crisis is often difficult to recall at the very time that it is needed the most. The risk is therefore that the METHANE message is never sent, with subsequent delay in an appropriately-scaled emergency response. Prometheus IMT METHANE aims to be an intuitive, simple, quick and reliable way of building a METHANE message in a major incident situation, or an ETHANE message in a complex incident (i.e. a lower tier of incident where the essential components of the message are still very useful).\n\nPrometheus IMT METHANE has been designed and develop by highly experienced emergency responders who still struggle to have the right fluency with the METHANE message when under extreme pressure. This is a tool designed to meet our needs. We believe others out there share those needs. Please let us know how we can make it better."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "Immuni is the official exposure notification app of the Italian government, developed by the Extraordinary Commissioner for the COVID-19 Emergency, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry for Innovation Technology and Digitalization. The app is developed and released in full compliance with the protection of the user's personal data and with current legislation, including the law-decree of April 30, 2020, n. 28.\n\nIn the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, the app aims to notify users at risk of carrying the virus as early as possible—even when they are asymptomatic. These users can then self-isolate to avoid infecting others, minimising the spread of the virus and speeding up the return to normal life for the majority of the population. By being alerted early, these users can also contact their general practitioner promptly and lower the risk of serious consequences.\n\nThe system is based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is designed to be especially energy-efficient, and it doesn’t collect any geolocation data, including GPS data. The app does not (and cannot) collect any data that would identify the user, such as their name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address. Therefore, Immuni is able to determine that contact has taken place between two users without knowing who those users are and where the contact occurred.\n\nHere is a list of some of the measures by which Immuni protects the user’s privacy:\n• The minimum amount of data is collected—only data which is strictly necessary to support and improve the exposure notification system.\n• The Bluetooth Low Energy code transmitted by the app is generated randomly and does not contain any information about the user's smartphone, let alone the user. In addition, this code changes several times every hour, protecting user privacy even more.\n• The data saved on the smartphone is encrypted.\n• The connections between the app and the server are encrypted.\n• All data, whether stored on the device or on the server, is deleted when no longer relevant, and certainly no later than December 31, 2020.\n• The Ministry of Health is the body that collects the data and decides for which purposes to use it. The data is used solely with the aim of containing the COVID-19 epidemic or for scientific research.\n• The data is stored on servers in Italy and managed by public bodies.\n\nImmuni does not and cannot diagnose. Based on the user’s history of exposure to potentially contagious users, it makes recommendations about what to do next. However, the app is not a medical device and is certainly not a substitute for a doctor.\n\nImmuni is a valuable tool in the fight against this horrendous epidemic, and every single user increases its overall effectiveness. It is strongly recommended to install the app, use it correctly, and encourage friends and loved ones to do likewise. However, nobody is compelled to use it. It is entirely the individual’s choice."

For your vaccination status (England only) use the separate NHS app, go to www.nhs.uk/app\n\nCOVID-19 has not gone away, so it’s important to remember the actions you can take to keep yourself and others safe. Everybody needs to continue to act carefully and remain cautious.\n\nDownload the app and keep it up to date to receive the latest guidance.\n\nThe app uses proven privacy software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. You can delete your data, or the app, at any time.\n\nThe NHS COVID-19 app features:\n\nAlerts: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have since tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nLatest information: Find out the latest COVID-19 guidance and know the level of COVID-19 risk in your local area.\n\nSymptoms: Check if you have COVID-19 symptoms and follow the latest guidance.\n\nTest:  Enter any positive test result (NHS or paid-for) to anonymously notify other app users who were near you that they might be at risk. You'll also get the latest health advice.\n \nAvailable in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.\n\nThe app can be used when travelling across England, Wales, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), and alerting them if they have been in contact with someone who later reported a positive test result in the app.\n\nThe app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.\n\nThe app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended)."

The app does not store or communicate the scanned information to third parties. The app performs the verification in offline mode, i.e. without invoking a remote system service when it is used. In order to verify the certificate authenticity the app must access the backend of the DGC national platfor at least once a day, connected to the European gateway (DGCG), where all the public keys used to sign the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate” are collected.\r\n\r\nThe workflow of the VerificationC19 app is divided into the following phases:\r\n- The person who must verify the certification asks the user to show the QR code of his certificate\r\n- Using the app, the QR code is read and its authenticity is verified using the public key signing the certificate\r\n- Once the information contained in the COVID-19 Green Certification or the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate\" has been decoded, the app shows the main information:\r\n- Name, surname and date of birth of the certificate holder\r\n- Unique identifier of the certificate\r\n- Validity of the certificate\r\n- The certificate is verified against the decoded date information and the Italian rules for COVID-19 green certifications.\r\n- The person in charge proceeds to visually check the correspondence of the personal data of the holder shown by the VerificationC19 app and certificate holder ID card."

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

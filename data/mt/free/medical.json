We may need a rash identifier, a mole checker, a skin analyzer, or an acne scanner, depending on the problem. The AI-Dermatologist app combines all these functions. We have designed this modern skin analyzer so that by using it on a regular basis, if you suspect a problem, you can contact your healthcare providers in time and avoid complications.\n\nBased on today's most advanced Artificial intelligence technologies and professional knowledge and expertise in dermatology, our application enables you to check all your skin problems for risk assessment: spots, birthmarks, acne, moles or papillomas. In 1 minute AI-Dermatologist gives a result on the next step to be taken. Likewise, AI-Dermatologist gives you the opportunity to store photos to keep track of changes over time and monitor your skin health in the long run. By creating AI-Dermatologist, we supported the idea of making skin screening and monitoring accessible to everyone.\n\nWith AI-Dermatologist you can:\n- Snapshot your skin spots, birth-marks, mole or another skin diseases such as: angioma, warts, papillomas, mollusks and etc.\n- Take / upload photos and track results for changes\n- Get a reminder when it is time to take a new photo, take pills or build a skin care routine \n- Сreate your own scheme for the medicines or cosmetics’ use according to your schedule \n- Track dynamics of baseline and follow-up results\n- Easily log the tracked your skin conditions locations on your body\n\nPlease note that AI-Dermatologist is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace or cancel a visit to your doctor. This application aims to help you be more aware of your skin condition via self-exams, but it is not an online dermatology platform. If you ever feel uncomfortable or see that your skin spot is changing, irritated, itchy or bleeding, we strongly recommend that you contact a medical specialist without hesitation to avoid the risk of melanoma or other skin diseases.\n\nBy signing up for this subscription, you agree to our\nTerms of use http://ai-derm.com/terms/terms_of_use.html\nPrivacy Policy http://ai-derm.com/privacy/privacy.html"

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves.

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "Immuni is the official exposure notification app of the Italian government, developed by the Extraordinary Commissioner for the COVID-19 Emergency, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry for Innovation Technology and Digitalization. The app is developed and released in full compliance with the protection of the user's personal data and with current legislation, including the law-decree of April 30, 2020, n. 28.\n\nIn the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, the app aims to notify users at risk of carrying the virus as early as possible—even when they are asymptomatic. These users can then self-isolate to avoid infecting others, minimising the spread of the virus and speeding up the return to normal life for the majority of the population. By being alerted early, these users can also contact their general practitioner promptly and lower the risk of serious consequences.\n\nThe system is based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is designed to be especially energy-efficient, and it doesn’t collect any geolocation data, including GPS data. The app does not (and cannot) collect any data that would identify the user, such as their name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address. Therefore, Immuni is able to determine that contact has taken place between two users without knowing who those users are and where the contact occurred.\n\nHere is a list of some of the measures by which Immuni protects the user’s privacy:\n• The minimum amount of data is collected—only data which is strictly necessary to support and improve the exposure notification system.\n• The Bluetooth Low Energy code transmitted by the app is generated randomly and does not contain any information about the user's smartphone, let alone the user. In addition, this code changes several times every hour, protecting user privacy even more.\n• The data saved on the smartphone is encrypted.\n• The connections between the app and the server are encrypted.\n• All data, whether stored on the device or on the server, is deleted when no longer relevant, and certainly no later than December 31, 2020.\n• The Ministry of Health is the body that collects the data and decides for which purposes to use it. The data is used solely with the aim of containing the COVID-19 epidemic or for scientific research.\n• The data is stored on servers in Italy and managed by public bodies.\n\nImmuni does not and cannot diagnose. Based on the user’s history of exposure to potentially contagious users, it makes recommendations about what to do next. However, the app is not a medical device and is certainly not a substitute for a doctor.\n\nImmuni is a valuable tool in the fight against this horrendous epidemic, and every single user increases its overall effectiveness. It is strongly recommended to install the app, use it correctly, and encourage friends and loved ones to do likewise. However, nobody is compelled to use it. It is entirely the individual’s choice."

The app does not store or communicate the scanned information to third parties. The app performs the verification in offline mode, i.e. without invoking a remote system service when it is used. In order to verify the certificate authenticity the app must access the backend of the DGC national platfor at least once a day, connected to the European gateway (DGCG), where all the public keys used to sign the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate” are collected.\r\n\r\nThe workflow of the VerificationC19 app is divided into the following phases:\r\n- The person who must verify the certification asks the user to show the QR code of his certificate\r\n- Using the app, the QR code is read and its authenticity is verified using the public key signing the certificate\r\n- Once the information contained in the COVID-19 Green Certification or the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate\" has been decoded, the app shows the main information:\r\n- Name, surname and date of birth of the certificate holder\r\n- Unique identifier of the certificate\r\n- Validity of the certificate\r\n- The certificate is verified against the decoded date information and the Italian rules for COVID-19 green certifications.\r\n- The person in charge proceeds to visually check the correspondence of the personal data of the holder shown by the VerificationC19 app and certificate holder ID card."

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

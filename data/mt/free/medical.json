Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

      "label": "MedM Health - the most connected and user-friendly mobile health diary for personal or family use \n\n\nOur health tracking mobile app is a single entry point for journaling such physiological data as blood sugar, fetal doppler, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, ECG, body weight, level of blood oxygen (SpO2), spirometry, activity, and sleep. Data can be collected automatically from fitness and medical devices or entered manually via the app’s Smart Entry. \n\nThe MedM Health application does not require registration but offers optional synchronization and backup with our free cloud service. Unregistered users can keep their health diaries in offline mode (data stored on the smartphone). \n\nThe MedM Health journal offers its users: \n\n* Easy entry: the app can be set to receive data from devices automatically (the settings screen appears at pairing); alternatively, it takes just a couple of taps to add a journal entry manually. \n\n* Reminders: customizable reminders can be set for various repeat intervals and help ensure that measurements and/or pills are taken on time. \n\n \n\n* Thresholds: notifications (push or email) can be sent if measurements for selected vital signs surpass a set value. \n\n* Remote access and data sharing: the MedM Cloud users can export and backup data to and print out reports from the MedM Health portal (https://health.medm.com). It is also possible to share health data with loved ones, friends, and physicians. The cloud keeps the health journal safely stored and up-to-date, even if medical or fitness devices change. \n\n\n\n* Uncluttered interface: the app’s clean and minimalistic design with no ads or in-app purchases helps users focus on tracking their data. \n \n* Data safety: MedM complies with all applicable data protection best practices: measurements are securely synchronized with MedM Cloud via HTTPS protocol, and data is stored encrypted on securely hosted servers. Users exercise full control of their records and can export or request to delete them at any time. \n\n \n\n* Export to/import from Apple Health: activity information (daily steps and sleep), heart rate, weight, blood pressure, blood oxygen, blood glucose, spirometry, and body temperature data. \n\n\nMedM is the absolute world leader in Smart Medical devices connectivity. Our apps provide seamless direct data collection from hundreds of fitness and medical devices, sensors, and wearables equipped with Bluetooth and ANT+. \n \n\nMedM Apps are compatible with products of the following vendors: \n \nA&D Medical, Aerotel, AndesFit, ARKRAY, AViTa, Bayer Vital, Berry, Biolight, Bodimetrics, Borsam, CGS Sensors, ChoiceMMed, Coagusense, Contec, Cosinuss, Creative Industry, D-Heart, eHealthSource, Entra Health Systems Co.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "Healthcare professionals and patients should use this application to search for potential drug-drug interactions between anti-HIV drugs and other medications, as recommended by international treatment guidelines. Results are presented as a “Traffic Light” system (red, amber, yellow and green) to indicate the recommendation. A brief summary of each interaction is given along with a grading of the quality of evidence (very low, low, moderate, high). The application is available free of charge and has been developed by the Liverpool Drug Interactions Group at the University of Liverpool and Clubzap Ltd. \n\nRequirements:\nThis is an “offline” application that is downloaded to your device. An internet connection is not required to use the application, but is needed for downloading updates.\n\nWhy this application may be useful:\nIn HIV therapy, patients take more than one HIV medication at a time and possibly other drugs to treat co-existing conditions. Many of the drug combinations have the potential to interact and this can affect either the patient's safety or the effectiveness of treatment. For this reason some drug combinations should not be given at all, while other drugs may be used together with caution, possibly requiring adjustments to dosage or time of administration. This application is a guide to interactions that may occur between different anti-HIV drugs and other medications that the HIV-infected patient may be prescribed. The application is regularly updated as new data emerge.  Full details about the interactions can be found at www.hiv-druginteractions.org."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

      "label": "Immuni is the official exposure notification app of the Italian government, developed by the Extraordinary Commissioner for the COVID-19 Emergency, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry for Innovation Technology and Digitalization. The app is developed and released in full compliance with the protection of the user's personal data and with current legislation, including the law-decree of April 30, 2020, n. 28.\n\nIn the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, the app aims to notify users at risk of carrying the virus as early as possible—even when they are asymptomatic. These users can then self-isolate to avoid infecting others, minimising the spread of the virus and speeding up the return to normal life for the majority of the population. By being alerted early, these users can also contact their general practitioner promptly and lower the risk of serious consequences.\n\nThe system is based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is designed to be especially energy-efficient, and it doesn’t collect any geolocation data, including GPS data. The app does not (and cannot) collect any data that would identify the user, such as their name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address. Therefore, Immuni is able to determine that contact has taken place between two users without knowing who those users are and where the contact occurred.\n\nHere is a list of some of the measures by which Immuni protects the user’s privacy:\n• The minimum amount of data is collected—only data which is strictly necessary to support and improve the exposure notification system.\n• The Bluetooth Low Energy code transmitted by the app is generated randomly and does not contain any information about the user's smartphone, let alone the user. In addition, this code changes several times every hour, protecting user privacy even more.\n• The data saved on the smartphone is encrypted.\n• The connections between the app and the server are encrypted.\n• All data, whether stored on the device or on the server, is deleted when no longer relevant, and certainly no later than December 31, 2020.\n• The Ministry of Health is the body that collects the data and decides for which purposes to use it. The data is used solely with the aim of containing the COVID-19 epidemic or for scientific research.\n• The data is stored on servers in Italy and managed by public bodies.\n\nImmuni does not and cannot diagnose. Based on the user’s history of exposure to potentially contagious users, it makes recommendations about what to do next. However, the app is not a medical device and is certainly not a substitute for a doctor.\n\nImmuni is a valuable tool in the fight against this horrendous epidemic, and every single user increases its overall effectiveness. It is strongly recommended to install the app, use it correctly, and encourage friends and loved ones to do likewise. However, nobody is compelled to use it. It is entirely the individual’s choice."

The app does not store or communicate the scanned information to third parties. The app performs the verification in offline mode, i.e. without invoking a remote system service when it is used. In order to verify the certificate authenticity the app must access the backend of the DGC national platfor at least once a day, connected to the European gateway (DGCG), where all the public keys used to sign the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate” are collected.\r\n\r\nThe workflow of the VerificationC19 app is divided into the following phases:\r\n- The person who must verify the certification asks the user to show the QR code of his certificate\r\n- Using the app, the QR code is read and its authenticity is verified using the public key signing the certificate\r\n- Once the information contained in the COVID-19 Green Certification or the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate\" has been decoded, the app shows the main information:\r\n- Name, surname and date of birth of the certificate holder\r\n- Unique identifier of the certificate\r\n- Validity of the certificate\r\n- The certificate is verified against the decoded date information and the Italian rules for COVID-19 green certifications.\r\n- The person in charge proceeds to visually check the correspondence of the personal data of the holder shown by the VerificationC19 app and certificate holder ID card."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

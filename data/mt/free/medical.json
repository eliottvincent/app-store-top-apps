Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more!

Diante disso, o Conecte SUS, a partir da implementação da Rede Nacional de Dados em Saúde (RNDS), foi redirecionado para receber e compartilhar informações que auxiliem no controle da situação de emergência da saúde pública, com destaque ao processo de vacinação Covid-19 no Brasil.\nFuncionalidades:\nAcesse os resultados de exames realizados por qualquer laboratório no território nacional integrado à RNDS para a detecção da Covid-19;\nVeja seu histórico de vacinação na Carteira de Vacinação Digital;\n*No momento, o Conecte SUS apenas apresenta os dados relacionados à vacinação contra a Covid-19, especificando a data da aplicação, o nome da vacina, o lote, o estabelecimento de saúde e o código do vacinador. Gradativamente serão disponibilizadas as demais vacinas ministradas pelo SUS.\nEmita o Certificado Nacional de Vacinação Covid-19 na palma da mão. \nApós as duas doses da vacina (ou a dose única) serem registradas pelos estados ou municípios na RNDS¹, é possível emitir o certificado em pdf nos idiomas português, inglês e espanhol. Esse documento é válido em todo território nacional e pode ser autenticado gratuitamente, utilizando o leitor ValidaQRCode no próprio aplicativo ou digitando o código do documento em:\n https://validacertidao.saude.gov.br/;\n*No certificado é especificado os dados cadastrais da pessoa vacinada (nome, data de nascimento, sexo, CPF), data e horário de emissão, além de informações sobre as doses administradas, como a data de aplicação, nome da vacina, lote e estabelecimento de saúde. \nAcesse o histórico de internação hospitalar no SUS;\n*Dados a partir de abril de 2018.\n·      Veja os medicamentos dispensados pela Farmácia Popular;\nLocalize rapidamente os estabelecimentos mais próximos como os serviços de Saúde Bucal e Doenças Raras;\nConsulte dicas nutricionais e de atividades físicas e verifique o Índice de Massa Corporal (IMC) na funcionalidade “Peso Saudável”;\n \nQuer saber mais?\nAcesso o Conecte SUS na web em: https://conectesus-paciente.saude.gov.br/\nAcesse os portais:\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/conecte-sus\nhttps://www.gov.br/pt-br/servicos/certificado-nacional-de-vacinacao-covid-19\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/saude-digital\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/rnds\n¹ Os registros são de responsabilidade dos gestores estaduais e municipais de saúde, que fazem a coleta e envio das informações para a base de dados do Ministério da Saúde. Eles são feitos pelas equipes responsáveis do centro de vacinação ou da unidade de saúde onde a dose foi aplicada. Os dados são inseridos nos sistemas de informação próprios ou integrados à RNDS, no Sistema de Informações do Programa Nacional de Imunizações (SI-PNI) ou Sistema e-SUS Atenção Primária à Saúde (s-SUS APS). Após os dados enviados e processados, são inseridos de forma automática no Conecte SUS, que está disponível pelo celular ou na versão web."

      "label": "Get your life back from tinnitus. Let Oto help you feel calmer, find control and sleep better with its expertly designed tinnitus program. Oto has helped thousands of people learn to live with tinnitus. 86% report feeling better and have less stress after just 1 month.\n\n*‘I was told nothing would help and I had to live with it. Now I feel normal again!’*  - Maid Myriam\n\nThere is tinnitus help. This is not a tinnitus cure but Oto will show you how to push tinnitus into the background of life, so you can get back to what matters. So whether it’s ringing in the ears, whooshing, buzzing or a range of sounds, in just a few minutes a day, Oto will help you get your life back from tinnitus.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nOto will teach you how to stop caring about tinnitus. Gradually you’ll become less and less aware of it so eventually you can forget it’s even there. \n\nDISCOVER YOUR STAGE\n\nFirst up, you’ll discover which stage of the journey you’re at. Habituation is when tinnitus becomes like breathing: it’s a constant noise that is so normal, you forget it’s there. There are four stages to habituation and you’ll learn which one you’re at, as well as where you’re headed next. \n\nDAILY GUIDANCE\n\nYou’ll listen to a 5-10 minute audio session each day which will introduce you to a range of clinically proven techniques. Over the course of the program, you’ll learn which techniques work best for you and how to use them in a normal day. \n\nEnjoy the renowned therapy of Anna Pugh - an award winning tinnitus therapist - from the comfort of your own home with the daily sessions. Oto’s program has been created by doctors who understand tinnitus. They have tinnitus themselves, as well as decades of experience.\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET\n\nLearn:\n- CBT for tinnitus\n- Mindfulness sessions\n- Visualisation techniques\n- Sleep advice\n\nRelax:\n- Relaxation Therapy\n- Relaxing Sounds\n- Original Soundscapes\n- Binaural Beats\n- 3D Sounds\n- SOS sessions for moments of panic\n\nSleep well:\n- Sleep Sounds\n- Sleep Stories\n- Mindfulness for Sleep\n- Guided Sleep Meditation\n- White Noise\n\nPhysical therapy:\n- Tension release exercises\n- Jaw and neck relaxation\n- Shoulder release\n\nWHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY\n\n“So grateful for this app…Easily the best value for any app I've ever bought. I've spent more on professional visits that amounted to a shrug. Thank you Oto.” - Robert\n\n“After having a scuba diving accident, I developed tinnitus. I found Oto, wow, what a blessing. I was going off my mind and suddenly this had success. Keep up the sessions, go over it again. Worth every penny, it’s a lifesaver. 10/10 stars Thanks to the Oto team.” - Clinton\n\n“The OTO app has changed my life. I have had tinnitus for 3 years with no success in dealing with it. When I found the app and used it every day my life has changed. It hasn’t cured it but has helped me get in with my life instead of being a hostage to the noise. Each day is easier and brighter. Thank you.” - Taylor\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nOto is not a tinnitus cure or tinnitus treatment. Whilst Oto is designed to help to reduce the impact of the distress associated with tinnitus, it should not be used as a substitute for, or replace professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

For your vaccination status (England only) use the separate NHS app, go to www.nhs.uk/app\n\nCOVID-19 has not gone away, so it’s important to remember the actions you can take to keep yourself and others safe. Everybody needs to continue to act carefully and remain cautious.\n\nDownload the app and keep it up to date to receive the latest guidance.\n\nThe app uses proven privacy software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. You can delete your data, or the app, at any time.\n\nThe NHS COVID-19 app features:\n\nAlerts: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have since tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nLatest information: Find out the latest COVID-19 guidance and know the level of COVID-19 risk in your local area.\n\nSymptoms: Check if you have COVID-19 symptoms and follow the latest guidance.\n\nTest:  Enter any positive test result (NHS or paid-for) to anonymously notify other app users who were near you that they might be at risk. You'll also get the latest health advice.\n \nAvailable in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.\n\nThe app can be used when travelling across England, Wales, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), and alerting them if they have been in contact with someone who later reported a positive test result in the app.\n\nThe app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.\n\nThe app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended)."

      "label": "Immuni is the official exposure notification app of the Italian government, developed by the Extraordinary Commissioner for the COVID-19 Emergency, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry for Innovation Technology and Digitalization. The app is developed and released in full compliance with the protection of the user's personal data and with current legislation, including the law-decree of April 30, 2020, n. 28.\n\nIn the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, the app aims to notify users at risk of carrying the virus as early as possible—even when they are asymptomatic. These users can then self-isolate to avoid infecting others, minimising the spread of the virus and speeding up the return to normal life for the majority of the population. By being alerted early, these users can also contact their general practitioner promptly and lower the risk of serious consequences.\n\nThe system is based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is designed to be especially energy-efficient, and it doesn’t collect any geolocation data, including GPS data. The app does not (and cannot) collect any data that would identify the user, such as their name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address. Therefore, Immuni is able to determine that contact has taken place between two users without knowing who those users are and where the contact occurred.\n\nHere is a list of some of the measures by which Immuni protects the user’s privacy:\n• The minimum amount of data is collected—only data which is strictly necessary to support and improve the exposure notification system.\n• The Bluetooth Low Energy code transmitted by the app is generated randomly and does not contain any information about the user's smartphone, let alone the user. In addition, this code changes several times every hour, protecting user privacy even more.\n• The data saved on the smartphone is encrypted.\n• The connections between the app and the server are encrypted.\n• All data, whether stored on the device or on the server, is deleted when no longer relevant, and certainly no later than December 31, 2020.\n• The Ministry of Health is the body that collects the data and decides for which purposes to use it. The data is used solely with the aim of containing the COVID-19 epidemic or for scientific research.\n• The data is stored on servers in Italy and managed by public bodies.\n\nImmuni does not and cannot diagnose. Based on the user’s history of exposure to potentially contagious users, it makes recommendations about what to do next. However, the app is not a medical device and is certainly not a substitute for a doctor.\n\nImmuni is a valuable tool in the fight against this horrendous epidemic, and every single user increases its overall effectiveness. It is strongly recommended to install the app, use it correctly, and encourage friends and loved ones to do likewise. However, nobody is compelled to use it. It is entirely the individual’s choice."

The app does not store or communicate the scanned information to third parties. The app performs the verification in offline mode, i.e. without invoking a remote system service when it is used. In order to verify the certificate authenticity the app must access the backend of the DGC national platfor at least once a day, connected to the European gateway (DGCG), where all the public keys used to sign the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate” are collected.\r\n\r\nThe workflow of the VerificationC19 app is divided into the following phases:\r\n- The person who must verify the certification asks the user to show the QR code of his certificate\r\n- Using the app, the QR code is read and its authenticity is verified using the public key signing the certificate\r\n- Once the information contained in the COVID-19 Green Certification or the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate\" has been decoded, the app shows the main information:\r\n- Name, surname and date of birth of the certificate holder\r\n- Unique identifier of the certificate\r\n- Validity of the certificate\r\n- The certificate is verified against the decoded date information and the Italian rules for COVID-19 green certifications.\r\n- The person in charge proceeds to visually check the correspondence of the personal data of the holder shown by the VerificationC19 app and certificate holder ID card."

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

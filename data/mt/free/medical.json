Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

You can even see what Medications you have taken and the quantities, for the different time intervals, eg current week, current month, current year, etc.\n\nThe best feature of Medicine Scheduler and Tracker, MST is its calendar.  The calendar shows both past, current and future medicine schedules.  The calendar is integrated with a log record.  The log record will show each and every Medicine you have taken by the date.  You can sequence back to see records from previous months.\n\nIn SETUP, you can turn off or on reminder notifications, change Header colors, or setup other users to track.  The Medicine Tracker can be used to track meds for you pets, children or other family members.\n\nMedicine Tracker, can be setup for multiple users or to track multiple categories, eg Prescriptions, non Prescriptions, Vitamins, or supplements, etc."

Po zainstalowaniu aplikacji na tablecie można również składać elektroniczne podpisy na wybranych dokumentach (w tym na zgodzie pacjenta na przetwarzanie danych osobowych).\n\n3) „Zamówienia”.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

They are also easily stored in the baby diary. \n- Add a reminder for each event - periodic and easy-to-set\n- Log and track the activity of several babies. Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities.

      "label": "Get ready to have more energy, lift the brain fog, reduce your chronic pain, and feed your cells the nutrients they need to thrive, with the Wahls Diet App.\n\nWhat is the Wahls Diet App?\n\nThe Wahls Diet App makes following the paleo principles of the Wahls Diet easy. It is a powerful tool that will help you manage your multiple sclerosis symptoms. \n\nInside the app, you’ll find nutrient-rich, chef created recipes that are delicious, easy to plan with clear concise directions and shopping lists. What the recipes don’t contain are refined carbohydrates, sugars, and inflammatory foods. The app tracks nutrients for you to take the guess work out of complicated protocols, so you can concentrate on improving your health.\n\nThe Wahls Diet App filters in what you need and filters out what you don’t need.  \n\nDr. Wahls’ Story\n\nDr. Wahls was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2000 and declined rapidly. Within four years, she was in a wheelchair, unable to sit straight. Not willing to accept her fate without a fight, she began her healing journey by learning everything she could from the most cutting-edge nutritional studies that could impact the brain, nerves, and muscles. \n\nShe then started to experiment on herself with nutritionally dense whole foods. She started to feel better, then sat upright, then walked with a cane, and finally went from a wheelchair to a bicycle!\n\nHow the Wahls Diet App can Help You\n\nThe Wahls Protocol Diet is complex. It’s paleo-based, with a focus on sulfur-rich foods, fermented foods, leafy greens, colored vegetables, and the protein sources are meat, including organ meats, and fish, nuts, and some protein powders. \n\nAs dairy can be inflammatory, it is not allowed, but there are other choices. Certain foods are daily, and some are weekly with varying serving sizes. \n\nFor someone with multiple sclerosis who is inspired by my success and wants to try the Wahls Protocol Diet, the App does the work for you. It would be too complicated to figure all of this out yourself, especially if you don’t feel well and may be experiencing brain fog and fatigue. \n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\n“I have been doing the Wahls Protocol for about a month - the results are amazing. I went from a lot of aches and pains - low energy - mood swings - brain fog and headaches to no symptoms in just the 2nd week.” – Leanne T.\n“I've been treating my severe secondary progressive MS naturally for 4 years now following the Wahls Protocol. I have had no relapses and getting stronger every day. My fatigue is so greatly improved and I have a ton of energy and symptoms keep slowly but surely easing up and going away.” – Faith H.\n\nBenefits of the App \n\n1. Select from hundreds of chef-created, nutrient-rich, delicious recipes that follow the Wahls Diet Protocol. You can be certain that the foods you eat will help you manage and improve your MS symptoms. \n\n2. Each recipe has undergone thorough nutritional analysis. Know the nutrient profile of each dish with a simple tap of a button. \n\n3. The calendar feature allows you to plan meals in advance. Easily organize your meals on a daily or weekly basis and according to mealtime. \n\n4. With just a glance, the Wahls Diet App lets you know if you are reaching your daily and weekly goals and if not suggests dishes that will help you reach them. \n\n5. Easily create a shopping list based on the meals you have planned. \n\n6. Each meal comes with step-by-step cooking instructions.\n \n“I wish this app were available when I was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis; it would have saved me years of trial and error and assisted me in getting out of my wheelchair sooner.” – Dr. Terry Wahls\n\nDownload the Wahls Diet App today.\n\nBy downloading this app, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy:\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://foogal.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/privacy_policy/WahlsPrivacyPolicy%28Jul2022%29.html\n\nTerms of Service:  \nhttps://foogal.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/privacy_policy/WahlsTerms&Con%28Jul2022%29.html"

This new SnakeBite911 consolidates an older suite of apps (SnakeBite911ER, SnakeBite911FR and SnakeBite911) into one tool.\nIt features a refreshed design and a new emergency mode for quick access to core functionality.*\n\nThis useful guide can help educate you about North American venomous pit viper snakes (including rattlesnakes, copperheads and cottonmouths), how to best avoid them, and what to do and what NOT to do should a snake strike happen!\nThis app also works without signal.\n\nFeatures\n• Emergency support for snakebite emergencies\n• Quick dial 911\n• List of actions you should/shouldn’t take in supporting the snakebite victim\n• Venom Tracker photo tool to log the spread of venom, which can help save diagnostic and treatment time when the victim gets to the ER\n• Learn about North American venomous snakes and how to identify them\n• Learn how to keep safe from snakes and avoid being bitten\n\nThe new SnakeBite911 app comes from the manufacturers of CroFab® CrotalidaePolyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine), a sheep-derived antivenin indicated for the management of adult and pediatric patients with North American crotalid envenomation. The term crotalid is used to describe the Crotalinae subfamily (formerly known as Crotalidae) of venomous snakes which includes rattlesnakes, copperheads and cottonmouths/water moccasins.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nDo not administer CroFab® to patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of its components, or to papaya or papain unless the benefits outweigh the risks and appropriate management for anaphylactic reactions is readily available.\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nCoagulopathy: In clinical trials, recurrent coagulopathy (the return of a coagulation abnormality after it has been successfully treated with antivenin), characterized by decreased fibrinogen, decreased platelets, and elevated prothrombin time, occurred in approximately half of the patients studied; one patient required re-hospitalization and additional antivenin administration. Recurrent coagulopathy may persist for 1 to 2 weeks or more. Patients who experience coagulopathy due to snakebite should be monitored for recurrent coagulopathy for up to 1 week or longer. During this period, the physician should carefully assess the need for re-treatment with CroFab® and use of any type of anticoagulant or anti-platelet drug.\n\nHypersensitivity Reactions: Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur with CroFab®. In case of acute hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions, discontinue infusion and institute appropriate emergency treatment. Patients allergic to papain, chymopapain, other papaya extracts, or the pineapple enzyme bromelain may also have an allergic reaction to CroFab®. Follow-up all patients for signs and symptoms of delayed allergic reactions or serum sickness (e.g., rash, fever, myalgia, arthralgia).\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% of subjects) reported in the clinical studies were urticaria, rash, nausea, pruritus and back pain. Adverse reactions involving the skin and appendages (primarily rash, urticaria, and pruritus) were reported in 12 of the 42 patients. Two patients had a severe allergic reaction (severe hives and a severe rash and pruritus) following treatment and one patient discontinued CroFab® due to an allergic reaction. Recurrent coagulopathy due to envenomation and requiring additional treatment may occur.\nFind out more at www.CroFab.com, which includes the full Prescribing Information. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact 1-877-377-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

App users can time and videotape seizures simultaneously in this revolutionary and simple-to-use application. When you stop the video and timer, it immediately creates an event log that is stored in a seizure library. You can edit the event at any time to add additional details about triggers, seizure description and what happened afterward. You can also use this app to log seizures without videos attached.\n\nVideos recorded through this app can be synchronized to SeizureTracker.com  which allows them to be shared through the extensive website reporting capabilities. \n\nSeizure Tracker was founded by the parents of a child with Epilepsy. We were searching for solutions to ease our own situation and in the process found a way to give back to the community and help others too. Our goal is to empower people living with Epilepsy while redefining the way information about seizures and Epilepsy is collected and shared.\n\nKey Features\n- Time and visually record seizures as they happen\n- Videotape seizures and upload them to SeizureTracker.com for private sharing\n- Record VNS Usages and Rescue Medication administrations\n- Automatically add recorded seizure to Library\n- Add additional information to seizure entries\n- Create seizure entries with manual entry tool\n- Store information in Seizure Library\n- Record the location of your event and review it within a map on SeizureTracker.com\n- Synchronize events with SeizureTracker.com account\n- Graph synchronized events (and surrounding information) through the integrated Seizure Tracker system\n\nPlease email Info@SeizureTracker.com with comments and suggestions."

      "label": "Seizure Alert-My Medic Watch is a smartwatch app which interprets data captured by sensor technologies on your watch. By using innovative algorithms, it automatically detects if the wearer has a seizure and activates immediate emergency assistance.\r\n\r\nMy Medic Watch provides monthly and yearly subscriptions which include a 30-day free trial. \r\n\r\nWe do not sell or provide smartwatches, view our compatible smartwatch options at https://www.mymedicwatch.com/smartwatches/\r\n\r\nToday, more and more people are choosing to live independently, in their own homes, aided by vital technology innovations like Seizure Alert - My Medic Watch, which was validated by Medical trials in Sydney.\r\n\r\nSeizure Alert-My Medic Watch is designed to be downloaded to a wearable device such as a smartwatch. It can be worn by people of all ages who are prone to seizures, and people who are still living alone in their home.\r\n\r\nThis ground-breaking app uses proprietary and innovative algorithms, which interprets data automatically captured by sensor technologies on the smartwatch, to determine if the wearer has a seizure.\r\n\r\nIf the wearer does have a seizure, Seizure Alert-My Medic Watch automatically detects it and notifies all nominated caregivers, without the need for manual intervention, providing details of the individual’s location. The app can also be activated manually by the wearer if he or she is feeling unwell and requires assistance, simply by pressing a button on their smartwatch.\r\n\r\nSeizure Alert - My Medic Watch allows people who are vulnerable to seizures to get immediate care and assistance when they have a seizure, so they remain feeling safe in their normal environment and can keep their autonomy.\r\n\r\nThis process has four steps:\r\n\r\n1. Smart Detection: As soon as a seizure occurs, Seizure Alert-My Medic Watch detects it using smartwatch sensors and an accurate algorithm.\r\n\r\n2. Immediate Alert: The app then automatically sends notifications with the wearer’s GPS location to the nominated caregivers without the need for manual intervention based on workflows of escalation.\r\n\r\n3. Reassurance for Everyone: All caregivers are sent updates of the progress, keeping everyone informed and reassured.\r\n\r\n4. Real-Time Data: Included in the user’s subscription is access to real-time data for all related medical episodes. The user can also choose to give access to his or her doctor, so that their medical data can be reviewed securely, online. The App uses HealthKit to save and store the user's heart rate during the medical episode.\r\n\r\nThanks to Seizure Alert-My Medic Watch, those with a condition that makes them susceptible to seizures, can continue to live independently in their own homes, with ultimate peace of mind.\r\n\r\nApp subscription information:\r\n\r\nWith the Seizure Alert - My Medic Watch app subscriptions, the wearer has his/her smartwatch app running and benefits from being monitored all the time with automatic seizure detection. These app subscriptions include automatic medical event app notifications.\r\n\r\nPlease read below details about this subscription before purchasing it.\r\n\r\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\r\n\r\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current month\r\n\r\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current month, and identify the cost of the renewal\r\n\r\n- Current subscription may not be cancelled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your iTunes Account Settings after purchase\r\n\r\n- You can refer to My Medic Watch Terms & Conditions (https://www.mymedicwatch.com/terms-conditions/) and our Privacy Policy (https://www.mymedicwatch.com/privacy-policy/)\r\n\r\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that product, where applicable"

      "label": "Immuni is the official exposure notification app of the Italian government, developed by the Extraordinary Commissioner for the COVID-19 Emergency, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry for Innovation Technology and Digitalization. The app is developed and released in full compliance with the protection of the user's personal data and with current legislation, including the law-decree of April 30, 2020, n. 28.\n\nIn the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, the app aims to notify users at risk of carrying the virus as early as possible—even when they are asymptomatic. These users can then self-isolate to avoid infecting others, minimising the spread of the virus and speeding up the return to normal life for the majority of the population. By being alerted early, these users can also contact their general practitioner promptly and lower the risk of serious consequences.\n\nThe system is based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is designed to be especially energy-efficient, and it doesn’t collect any geolocation data, including GPS data. The app does not (and cannot) collect any data that would identify the user, such as their name, date of birth, address, telephone number, or email address. Therefore, Immuni is able to determine that contact has taken place between two users without knowing who those users are and where the contact occurred.\n\nHere is a list of some of the measures by which Immuni protects the user’s privacy:\n• The minimum amount of data is collected—only data which is strictly necessary to support and improve the exposure notification system.\n• The Bluetooth Low Energy code transmitted by the app is generated randomly and does not contain any information about the user's smartphone, let alone the user. In addition, this code changes several times every hour, protecting user privacy even more.\n• The data saved on the smartphone is encrypted.\n• The connections between the app and the server are encrypted.\n• All data, whether stored on the device or on the server, is deleted when no longer relevant, and certainly no later than December 31, 2020.\n• The Ministry of Health is the body that collects the data and decides for which purposes to use it. The data is used solely with the aim of containing the COVID-19 epidemic or for scientific research.\n• The data is stored on servers in Italy and managed by public bodies.\n\nImmuni does not and cannot diagnose. Based on the user’s history of exposure to potentially contagious users, it makes recommendations about what to do next. However, the app is not a medical device and is certainly not a substitute for a doctor.\n\nImmuni is a valuable tool in the fight against this horrendous epidemic, and every single user increases its overall effectiveness. It is strongly recommended to install the app, use it correctly, and encourage friends and loved ones to do likewise. However, nobody is compelled to use it. It is entirely the individual’s choice."

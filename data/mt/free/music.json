Now two pairs of Bose® wireless headphones can share the experience - listen together, at the same time, while one of you DJ’s. New PARTY MODE lets you sync two SoundLink® speakers for double the audio…ideal for listening in two different places, and new STEREO MODE immerses you in music by separating the sound into Left and Right channels across two paired speakers for that amazing stereo experience.\n\nGET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR HEADPHONES\nCONTROLLABLE NOISE CANCELLATION on our QC®30 headphones lets you decide how much of the world to let in by adjusting the level of noise cancellation right in the app. And the built-in HEART RATE MONITOR for our SoundSport® Pulse headphones displays your heart rate clearly in the app.\n \nAND SO MUCH MORE\nFrom viewing product details to personalizing settings, get the most out of your Bose wireless products. It even downloads the latest software in the background and only installs it when you’re ready. See how our simple app can make all the difference.\n \n * NOTE * \nBose Connect works with Bose Frames, QC®35, SoundSport® wireless, SoundSport® Pulse wireless, SoundSport® Free wireless, QuietControl™ 30, SoundLink® wireless II, ProFlight® headphones, and SoundWear Companion speaker, SoundLink® Color II, SoundLink® Revolve, SoundLink® Revolve+, SoundLink® Micro, and S1 Pro® speakers   \nSome features may not be available for all products.\nThe Bluetooth® word mark and logos are registered trademarks owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc. and any use of such marks by Bose Corporation is under license.\n\nhttps://www.bose.com/en_us/legal/california_privacy_notice_of_collection.html\n\nhttps://worldwide.bose.com/privacypolicy"

As the iPhone rotates the display will remain stationary from your perspective for easy reading.\n\nThe UNIQUE feature of RPM is that it shows a scrolling graph of the rpm accuracy variation over time, this shows wow/flutter effects, especially those associated with the turntable not being level, belt wear, etc.  You can even detect the small drag caused by the stylus resting in the grooves of the record.\n\nThe most recent amazing new innovative feature is to visualise wow and flutter variations plotted around the vinyl centre to show a heat map of exactly where in the turntable rotation inaccuracies occur. \n\nThere are many ways of testing the average RPM of your turntable, some turntables even have this built in, however there is no other practical way of showing the wow/flutter variation over time than RPM.\n\nThe history graph parameters can be customised to:\n - Set the moving average sample size.\n - Accuracy at which to turn the rpm circle sold green.\n - Set a duration after which the display updates will freeze so they can continue to be read after the turntable is stopped.\n  \nThe RPM realtime display is reliant on the iPhones gyroscope accuracy, if you suspect yours isn't quite right then you can now use Calibration Mode to auto test and then apply any necessary correction in real time.\nThis auto calibration uses the compass to count the turntable revolutions, if you have an older iPhone (not iPhone 6S or newer) then this may be unreliable, in this case you can still add your own multiplier if you have done an independent calibration.\n\nExtensive testing means we're now confident that using RPM can help you setup your turntable to be within 0.1% of its target RPM, assuming your turntable can be adjusted and is itself stable within that tolerance of course.\n\nThe World RPM Turntable Performance Database now has over 10,000 submissions from RPM users worldwide to build the ultimate resource for researching the most accurate turntables out there.  Upgrade to join in and upload your own turntable data, go to Settings and make sure you have the Freeze time set then do an RPM session as normal.  At the end of the time you will be asked to name your session after which you will have the option to also upload it to the World DB.  You can always upload from History later too.\n\nUpgrade to enable unlimited measurements, continuous display, all settings, all speeds, no ads."

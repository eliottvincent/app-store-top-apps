It even downloads the latest software in the background and only installs it when you’re ready. See how our simple app can make all the difference.\n \n * NOTE * \nBose Connect works with Bose Frames, QC®35, SoundSport® wireless, SoundSport® Pulse wireless, SoundSport® Free wireless, QuietControl™ 30, SoundLink® wireless II, ProFlight® headphones, and SoundWear Companion speaker, SoundLink® Color II, SoundLink® Revolve, SoundLink® Revolve+, SoundLink® Micro, and S1 Pro® speakers   \nSome features may not be available for all products.\nThe Bluetooth® word mark and logos are registered trademarks owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc. and any use of such marks by Bose Corporation is under license.\n\nhttps://www.bose.com/en_us/legal/california_privacy_notice_of_collection.html\n\nhttps://worldwide.bose.com/privacypolicy"

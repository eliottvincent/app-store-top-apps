The easiest way to get started with real music production.\n\n*** Apple Design Award ***\n*** Best of App Store ***\n*** Editor’s Choice ***\n\nWHY PEOPLE LOVE AUXY\n“Auxy is my favorite way to get what is going on in my brain into a musical format. It is simple on the surface but with tremendous depth if you need it.” - RAC\n\n“The automation is terrific. I am doing things with Auxy I would not easily do in my studio. The design is insanely smart and forward-thinking.” - Madeon\n\n“It is wild bro, you gotta get this!” - Majid Jordan\n\nCREATE AND MIX LOOPS\nBuild melodies and drum loops by drawing notes. Arrange your loops with scenes to explore ideas or make full-length tracks.\n\nDISCOVER GREAT SOUNDS\nBrowse thousands of high quality synth patches, sampled instruments and one-shot samples. You can import samples to the drum machine and build your own melodic instruments.\n\nADD EFFECTS AND AUTOMATION\nAdd studio-grade effects like reverb, delay, distortion and chorus. Fine-tune sounds to find the perfect mix. Create modulation and transitions with powerful automation.\n\nSHARE AND COLLABORATE\nUpload your tracks to SoundCloud or export them as audio or video files. Quickly share links to your projects if you want to collaborate with other producers.\n\nEXPORT TO YOUR FAVORITE DAW\nYou can export projects to Ableton Live, Bitwig Studio or Studio One, which makes Auxy a great sketchpad for producers on the go. You can also bounce projects as separate audio and MIDI files, which can be imported into any popular music-making app.\n\nJAM WITH FRIENDS\nAuxy supports Ableton Link, which lets you jam in sync with other apps and devices connected to the same Wi-Fi.\n\nTRY IT FREE\nAuxy is free to download and evaluate with a limited set of sounds. You also get a 7-day free trial to evaluate all the sounds and features before you start a subscription.\n\nMADE IN SWEDEN\nAuxy is built by a small and independent team in Sweden. Our mission is to put a studio in everyone's pocket and push music forward as an artform.\n\nTHANK YOU AUSTIN HAGA\nThe music in the preview video is made by Austin Haga. Find him on SoundCloud to hear more great tracks made with Auxy.\n\nLET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK\nSend your questions and thoughts to feedback@auxy.co and say hi on Instagram or Twitter.\n\nTerms of Service: https://auxy.co/terms.html"

      "label": "Hello, this is Erik the programmer of YouDJ. I am an audio engineer, programming YouDJ for 10 years as a passion project. I don't have any cost that's why all features in this app are unlocked with no subscription or ads!! It is the most honest DJ app on the store for sure. Enjoy! :)\n\nMy mission is to create the most FUN and EASY dj mixer, so even my mother can be a DJ!\n\nTherefore, YouDJ is NOT the most complete DJ app but offers the MUST-HAVE DJ TOOLS. You will see that all the tools are pretty high quality! That's because I am an expert in this field (being an audio engineer). I built advanced technologies to allow everyone to mix like a pro and have fun doing it. It is still usable by advanced DJs but if you need more tools (MIDI controllers...), use a pro DJ app.\n\nIncluded DJ tools : 2 virtual turntables, 16 sound effects such echo/flanger/crusher, sampler with 80 built-in samples, realistic vinyl scratching, auto beat synchronization, keylock, seamless loops, playlist automix, hotcues, 3 bands equalizer, crossfader, low/high pass filter, music visualization (party mode)...\n\nTo finish, you don't need to have music on your device, the app is preloaded with great music from talented artists I personally know. Please support the artists by following them on social medias. You can also play MP3 files stored on your device.\n\nImportant : No DJ app (including YouDJ) will work with Apple Music / Spotify / Youtube Music because these are closed platforms and all their songs are encrypted with DRM. Also there is no legal way to mix popular music without paying on mobile, so don't ask me why there is no Justin Bieber in the provided songs!! ;)\n\nYouDJ is available on all desktop and mobile platforms. You should definitely try at least the computer version too (you.dj).\n\nHoping you will love the app and be prepared to waste lot of time ;)\n\nIf you want to thank me for all my time I put in this app, you can give me a good review, it helps me a lot, thanks!\n\n----------\n\nHOW TO MIX\n\nWhat you got is a traditional DJ setup : 2 turntables and a mixer. Your mission is to play simultaneously two songs on each turntable and to use the mixer to mix them together.\n\nTo spice up your mix, you can use effects such as the loops, the fx pads, the eq, the scratch, the sampler, the hot cues...\n\n----------\n\nAgain, BIG THANKS TO YOU for loving YouDJ, it motivates me to continue the project,\n\nHave fun with YouDJ and take care :)\n\nErik the programmer"

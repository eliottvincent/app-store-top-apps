      "label": "Hello, this is Erik the programmer of YouDJ. I am an audio engineer, programming YouDJ for 10 years as a passion project. I don't have any cost that's why all features in this app are unlocked with no subscription or ads!! It is the most honest DJ app on the store for sure. Enjoy! :)\n\nMy mission is to create the most FUN and EASY dj mixer, so even my mother can be a DJ!\n\nTherefore, YouDJ is NOT the most complete DJ app but offers the MUST-HAVE DJ TOOLS. You will see that all the tools are pretty high quality! That's because I am an expert in this field (being an audio engineer). I built advanced technologies to allow everyone to mix like a pro and have fun doing it. It is still usable by advanced DJs but if you need more tools (MIDI controllers...), use a pro DJ app.\n\nIncluded DJ tools : 2 virtual turntables, 16 sound effects such echo/flanger/crusher, sampler with 80 built-in samples, realistic vinyl scratching, auto beat synchronization, keylock, seamless loops, playlist automix, hotcues, 3 bands equalizer, crossfader, low/high pass filter, music visualization (party mode)...\n\nTo finish, you don't need to have music on your device, the app is preloaded with great music from talented artists I personally know. Please support the artists by following them on social medias. You can also play MP3 files stored on your device.\n\nImportant : No DJ app (including YouDJ) will work with Apple Music / Spotify / Youtube Music because these are closed platforms and all their songs are encrypted with DRM. Also there is no legal way to mix popular music without paying on mobile, so don't ask me why there is no Justin Bieber in the provided songs!! ;)\n\nYouDJ is available on all desktop and mobile platforms. You should definitely try at least the computer version too (you.dj).\n\nHoping you will love the app and be prepared to waste lot of time ;)\n\nIf you want to thank me for all my time I put in this app, you can give me a good review, it helps me a lot, thanks!\n\n----------\n\nHOW TO MIX\n\nWhat you got is a traditional DJ setup : 2 turntables and a mixer. Your mission is to play simultaneously two songs on each turntable and to use the mixer to mix them together.\n\nTo spice up your mix, you can use effects such as the loops, the fx pads, the eq, the scratch, the sampler, the hot cues...\n\n----------\n\nAgain, BIG THANKS TO YOU for loving YouDJ, it motivates me to continue the project,\n\nHave fun with YouDJ and take care :)\n\nErik the programmer"

      "label": "The guitar tuner app used by professional guitar makers, guitar repair shops and musicians around the world. \n\nThe app listen and analyze the sound in real time from the built-in mic, headset, guitar clip on or from any other external microphone. It is so accurate that it will be your best friend for guitar intonation!\n\nBecause Pro Guitar Tuner is chromatic you can tune most types of stringed instruments. \n\nHigh-quality samples of real instruments are also accessible (i.e. tune by ear if preferred!). A massive library of different tunings for guitar, bass, balalaika, violin, ukulele and more makes it easy to find more qualities and characteristics from your instrument. \n\nThe interface:\nTo make it more intuitive, we give you information about the current pitch in many different ways:\n\n*Cents for the current pitch\n*A red/green light indicating the closest pitch\n*A note wheel corresponding to the chromatic scale\n*A fretboard with the current tuning setting displayed\n\nStandard guitar is set as default but the guitar tuner can be used to tune many different instruments, such as: \n*Guitars - Standard, 4-string, 5-string, 7-string, 8-string\n, 9-string, 10-string, 11-string, 12-string, and 13-string guitar\n*Bass guitars - Standard, 5-string bass and 6-string bass\n*Ukuleles - std (Soprano), Pocket, Concert, Tenor, Baritone, Bass, and Contrabass\n*Banjo - 4-string, 5-string, 6-string\n*Mandolin family - Mandolin (Soprano), Piccolo, Mandola (alto), Octave Mandolin (tenor), Mandocello (Baritone), Mandobass, Irish Bouzouki, Cittern, and Greek Bouzouki\n*Violin family - Violin, Viola, Cello (violoncello), Double bass and 5-string Double bass\n*Balalaika family - Prima, Piccolo, Secunda, Alto, Tenor, Bass and Contrabass\n\nAfter you have selected an instrument you choose a specific tuning. The app provides you with over 200 custom tunings.\n\nThe tuning options are divided into groups to make them easier to find. For guitar, the categories are:\n*General tunings\n*Raised tunings\n*Lowered tunings\n*Dropped tunings\n*Double dropped tunings\n*Major open tunings\n*Minor open tunings (cross-note)\n*Modal tunings\n*Miscellaneous tunings\n\nIf you have certain tunings that you often use, you can save them as favorites. This gives you easy access to them under favorite tunings.\n\nIn the app, you can choose to subscribe to Pro Guitar Tuner Premium. It´s  a monthly subscription that gives you the following features: \n\n*No Ads\n*All Tunings\n*All Instruments\n*Extra Settings\n\nIf you choose to purchase a monthly subscription, after your confirmation, the subscription will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription. The purchase is applied to your iTunes account.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.proguitar.com/about/policies/privacy\nTerms of Service: https://www.proguitar.com/about/policies/terms"

      "label": "Drum Kit is the simplest way to make your own beats.\n\nNow anyone can play the drums. No experience required. Start playing along to your favorite songs immediately.\n\nThe best drum app in the App Store just got better. Here's the long awaited sequel to Drum Kit. It's the closest thing to becoming a drummer without actually having a real kit. You can just tap to create your own beats, or you can play along to dozens of popular songs. It's super easy to use.\n\nThe kit is a classic 4-piece kit with bass drum, snare, floor tom, hi-hat, crash cymbal, and ride cymbal. The hi-hat plays open, closed, and pedal sounds depending on where you tap. The drums animate and the bass drum pedal moves when touched. Drum Kit simulates the most realistic drum playing experience on the App Store.\n\nDrum Kit is designed to be as responsive as possible and uses professionally recorded, high quality sounds. It is completely multi-touch and has very low latency. Use it to crank out some beats on the train or play a fill after a punchline. The photorealistic drums and animations make it feel like you're playing a real kit. \n\nFeatures:\n- customize your kit by moving drums around\n- play along to the MIDI version of many popular songs\n- record up to 1 minute of video\n- save video to the camera roll\n- share video\n- save and play back songs\n\nPlug into headphones or speakers for a much richer sound experience."

      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

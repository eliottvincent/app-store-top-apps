      "label": "High-quality vocals with your iPhone or iPad\n\nSpire for iOS combines award-winning iZotope audio processing with multi-track recording to make importing a beat, layering vocals, collaborating with your producer, and sharing songs easier than ever. When your iPhone is your mobile vocal booth with automatic Soundcheck, recording high-quality vocals is possible anywhere.\n\n• Import a beat and write lyrics\n\nGet started by importing your beat. Easily write and develop your lyrics directly in the Spire app and have them front-and-center while you record. \n\n• Automatically set your levels and tone\n\nWhen you run Soundcheck in Spire before you record, it will identify voice or an instrument, set your levels, and sculpt your tone. Vocals stand out in the mix through automatically adding compression, saturation, and EQ—powered by tech from the Vocal Assistant in iZotope's Nectar plug-in.\n\n• Layer vocals and mix your tracks\n\nBuilding a song with Spire is fast and intuitive. Easily capture lead vocals, overdubs, ad-libs, and more by just hitting record. You can edit out unwanted parts from any track with the trim tool. To mix, drag track icons up or down to adjust volume and left or right to pan.\n\n• Collaborate with artists and producers\n\nText or email a Spire project to anyone from the Spire app and they can preview your song, export mixdowns, download individual tracks to edit in a DAW, or open in Spire to add tracks of their own.\n\n• Share with your fans\n\nIf you’ve finished a song in Spire that you’re ready to show the world, you can publish your songs to SoundCloud, Instagram, and more directly from the app. Add artwork or a video to your project to make it your own before posting for your fans.\n\n---------\n\nGET PRO VOCALS WITH SPIRE PRO\n\nEnable Spire Pro and get full access to exclusive features and content that help you get pro-quality, release-ready vocals!\n\n• Tune your vocals\n\nAutomatically tune your vocals from natural to robotic, and treat your tracks like the pros do with Tune, a new, exclusive mix effect for Spire Pro. Add this creative effect from the Mix view to shape your vocals, featuring tech from iZotope Nectar’s Pitch module.\n\n• Pro Vocal Effects\n\nCurated vocal effects powered by technology from iZotope Nectar. Includes the most popular effects in modern music, like vocal tuning, reverb, EQ, and more–all on your phone.  Record with effects on or add them after, you can always change them.\n\n• Inspire Me\n\nInspire your creativity with randomized vocal effects that combine static EQ, plate reverb, iZotope Trash distortion, echo, chorus, and more. You can even share your favorite effects with other artists to inspire more music.\n\n• Personalized Soundcheck\n\nWhen you upgrade to Spire Pro, Soundcheck evolves to become your personal vocal recording engineer. By listening to your voice and environment, it applies personalized processing to make sure your voice sounds clear and polished, no matter where you record. Whether it’s with the Spire app or Spire Studio paired with an iPhone, singers and rappers can now create pro-quality vocals over their beats in seconds.\n\nLearn more about Spire Pro at izotope.com/spirepro\n\n------\n\nThe Spire app for iOS is also the controller app for Spire Studio hardware:\n\nPair the app to Spire Studio hardware to create an integrated recording experience you can take on-the-go and unlock hardware exclusive effects for vocals and instruments as well as Enhance, a mastering tool powered by award-winning tech from iZotope Ozone."

Musicians can control the send levels into their monitoring mix bus for all channels aux tracks and effects returns. \n\nIt makes the sound check painless and allows you to adjust the mix during the gig. \n\nSome key differentiating Features:\n • Linked channels are treated as a stereo channel to save screen space. \n • Double tapping a fader knob sets it 0.\n • Double tapping the panning control on a stereo channel pans the signal hard L/R. Another double tap reverses the panning.\n\nAnd as always: The app is built with data privacy in mind - no adds, no tracking!\n\nThe PRO pack unlocks even more features like:\n • Decayed meters with peak memory\n • Compression meters\n • Gate LEDs\n • Channel mute buttons (X32)\n • Group mute buttons (X32)\n • Unlimited groups\n • Scenes\n • Bus EQ"

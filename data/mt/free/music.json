Or like, let's start with some upbeat Mozart, add some retro McCartney into the mix and finish off with some blasting Ye. Or, kinda li- *kid electric scooters off after getting the point*\n\nIt really isn't rocket science - download now for more interesting playlists, read below to hear us brag about ourselves (p.s. we get real obnoxius real fast).\n\n--\n\nVibe Board™\n\nWhat makes Tempo unique is the ability to sketch the vibe of your playlist. Do you want a folk to rock playlist a la Dylan circa '65, or a Cloud 9 one that's pure euphoria.\n\nYou do you. Just select the audio feature, pick your genres and sketch your vibe.\n\nIf you can sketch it, you can listen to it.\n\n--\n\nGENRE\n\nMix and match different genres including \n\nRock, Pop, Indie Rock, Indie Pop, Electro, Folk, Jazz, Blues... \n\nand much more!\n\n--\n\nShake-to-Unlock GENRES\n\nHard to imagine you won't be satisfied with our default genres, but if you shake your phone at just the right times, you will be able to unlock even more easter egg genres including Disney, Movie, Funk... and much more.\n\n(Don't believe us? - shake your phone at 4:20 pm and see what happens ;)\n\n--\n\nAUDIO FEATURES\n\n\nTempo allows you to order your playlist by any of the 8 audio features used by Spotify including\n\nTempo, Danceability, Acousticness, Valence... and more.\n\nIf you ever wanted to make a playlist that starts out crying in the club (high danceability, low valence), rises to euphoria after a couple of drinks (high energy, high valence) and ends with an existential crisis at McDonalds at 4 am on a school night (low energy, low valence) - well, now you can!\n\n--\n\nSpotify INTEGRATION (duh!)\n\nIt goes without saying that with the Spotify integration, you can directly save your playlists to your Spotify account. Obvs.\n\n--\n\nSHARE TO Twitter\n\nYou can share your Vibe Board™ on Twitter. (Okay, okay, we know promoting stuff on your personal Twitter isn't cool and all, but this really helps us so pls share us :heart:)"

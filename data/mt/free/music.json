      "label": "Humanity is out of tune.\n“If one should desire to know whether a kingdom is well governed, if its morals are good or bad, the quality of its music will furnish the answer.” ~ Confucius.\n\nThe mass media is tuned to the concert pitch of A=440hz. The majority of mainstream music is in this pitch. Today's research shows that the 440 pitch might be a bit off and disharmonious with our bodies and minds. If you’re a Musician or an Audiophile or just love listening to your music this will be a tipping point for you. There is a movement in the Music World which is trying to bring the 432hz pitch into our lives. The A=432hz tuning is also known as “The Mathematical Tuning”, “The Natural Tuning”, ”The Pythagorean Tuning”. According to studies 432 resembles a code underlying our very universe in all aspects – light, time, gravity, magnetism, DNA, sacred geometry and the list goes on. 432 number, and its divisions, extends throughout all ancient history. Why is this important? Because sound (vibration) influences the mind and body immediately. Even the slightest constant dissonance can bring one to confusion, inner chaos and staying blind to what is going on around. Think about it, when something irritates you, the only thing you can deal with is making that thing stop. But you will never address bigger problems. It is well known today that the molecular structure of water is affected by vibration, thoughts, words, ideas and of-course Music. Our human body is made of approximately 70% water. So the link is pretty immediate here.\nI’m inviting you all to listen to your beloved music through this player which you might enjoy the brighter feeling it brings, but also will conceal healing qualities for the body and mind.\nLove Light & Meditation,\n\nP.S – I strongly recommend doing your own research on this most important matter. Please don’t rely solely upon my opinion and research.\n\n“Concerning matter, we have been all wrong. What we have called matter is energy, whose vibration has been so lowered as to be perceptible to the senses. There is no matter.”\n― Albert Einstein\n\nThe app is free and for those who want to hear their music in a more refined and healthy tone opposed to the 440 Hz.\n\n**The App Won't Play Apple Music Files.\n** The app will pitch shift music that's tuned to A = 440 Hz, it will not work on music tuned to other A note references.\n\nEnjoy\n\n*****If you do not have songs on your device the app will not have anything to play.*****\n\n** If something is not working please send an email to contact@appums.com and we'll try to find a solution.\nThanks\n\nPhoto Credits:\n* 432hz Cymaglyph by CymaScope."

Our aim is to promote Evangelical messages of joy and hope through the Word of God and to help better understanding of Christian beliefs and teachings. As part of the World Family of Radio Maria, the station embraces the same ideas as other Radio Maria stations do throughout the world. Thus the motto of WFRM and every radio station; ‘A Christian Voice in Your Home’.\nRadju Marija Malta is made up of one big family of people mainly volunteers who contribute their time to working in different areas. Radju Marija does not air any commercial advertisement. It depends entirely on donations sent in by listeners and above all through Divine Providence."

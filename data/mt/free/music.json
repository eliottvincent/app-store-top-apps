      "label": "Andante is a music practice journal that helps musicians organize their practice. Track your mood and focus and stay motivated with streaks, goals, and charts!\n\nAndante is a musical term that describes a simple, walking pace that feels calm and serene while always moving forward with intention. That idea is the core of this app: a music practice journal that promotes calm, meditative practice as you progress through your musical journey.\n\nAndante Practice Journal provides one place to keep a log of your practice sessions as well as a journal where you can write about anything on your mind, meaning you don’t have to keep track of everything in your head. You can track your mood and focus to identify patterns in your practicing so you can achieve the most meditative, productive practice possible. You can keep yourself motivated to keep moving forward with intention by setting goals and seeing charts. Lastly, you can improve your musicianship and practice with simple tools like a metronome, audio recorder, and drone tuner.\n\nFEATURES\n• Practice live with a timer, metronome, and audio recorder or manually add sessions with ease.\n• Track your mood and focus and see charts that help you understand your practicing.\n• Streak counter to motivate you to practice every day.\n• Daily practice goals take streaks even further by setting how long you want to practice each day. See your daily goal progress on your Home Screen with iOS 14 Home Screen widgets.\n• Charts and data. Visualize your progress with calendars and charts. See your practice time over the last 7 days, last month, or last year. See when you have the best mood by seeing trends between mood and time of day. And so much more!\n• Minimalist design. It's important that nothing gets in the way of your practicing. Andante is designed to be as clean and simple as possible while still providing robust features.\n\nANDANTE PRO\n• One time upgrade\n• Multiple practice profiles\n• Session notes\n• Drone tuner\n• Practice Reminders\n• Journal folders\n• Export practice log\n• Support the developer\n\nABOUT THE DEVELOPER\nMy name is Miles, and I’m a musician who recently graduated college. I originally started making Andante to help myself with my violin practice, and I would work on it every day to add features that would help me even more. Once I started giving it to friends and seeing how it helps people stay motivated, I was encouraged to take the project seriously and make Andante as excellent as possible. I hope that Andante can help with your practice journey!"

On the 17th June 2004, Radju Marija started transmitting through the frequency 102.3FM a National Licence, reaching throughout Malta and Gozo.\nIn 1998 Radju Marija Malta joined World Family Radio Maria (WFRM), being the fifth country to join which today has more than 70 different countries making part of WFRM. Our aim is to promote Evangelical messages of joy and hope through the Word of God and to help better understanding of Christian beliefs and teachings. As part of the World Family of Radio Maria, the station embraces the same ideas as other Radio Maria stations do throughout the world. Thus the motto of WFRM and every radio station; ‘A Christian Voice in Your Home’.\nRadju Marija Malta is made up of one big family of people mainly volunteers who contribute their time to working in different areas. Radju Marija does not air any commercial advertisement. It depends entirely on donations sent in by listeners and above all through Divine Providence."

      "label": "Join tens of thousands of happy users, and try Bluetooth Streamer Pro for free today! Trying to stream music to your Bluetooth car stereo, hearing aid, or headset? Looking for an inexpensive and wireless alternative to auxiliary cables or expensive aftermarket hardware? Look no further!\n\nStream ANY audio from your phone to your car stereo, hearing aid, or headset wirelessly, even if it only allows you to make phone calls now!\n\nDoes your vehicle have Bluetooth for making phone calls (hands-free), but it won’t let you stream your music and audio files? Mine does, and I searched high and low for a solution. The best option I found was to buy an expensive piece of hardware to perform the A2DP Bluetooth profile my car stereo was missing. That hardware finally allowed me to stream the audio and feed it into the auxiliary port. That is a great option if you want to spend $100+ on the hardware, but I thought there had to be a better way… If that doesn’t sound appealing to you, there is finally an affordable option…the Bluetooth Streamer Pro app! This app makes the car stereo (or any device that supports Bluetooth Hands-Free Protocol, HFP) think it is on a phone call and stream the music/audio that way!\n\nWorks especially well for podcasts and audiobooks such as Audible and Scribd!\n\nDownload the app for free. Then stream as much audio from as many different sources and to as many different targets as you like to test it for 7 days. After the 7 days, we ask that you purchase the app to continue to experience audio streaming bliss forever for less than the price of a latte at your favorite coffee shop ;)\n\nMost brand new automobiles that have Bluetooth are able to stream stereo music via A2DP protocol and make phone calls via HFP protocol. This app will not help you much with these vehicles. However, vehicles just a few years old that have Bluetooth installed from the factory only have HFP protocol, so they can only make phone calls via Bluetooth. There are also several new and older headsets and hearing aids that only have HFP Bluetooth. If you have one of these vehicles, headsets, or hearing aids and want to stream audio, this app is for you! This is not a comprehensive list (nor does it ensure it will work, please test on your equipment during the trial period), but many late-model vehicles made by Acura, General Motors with Onstar, and Audi MMI would benefit from this app. Headsets that may benefit include several Samsung, BlueAnt, and Plantronics models. Hearing aids that may benefit may include several Unitron and Phonak models. Again, please test on your own equipment during the free trial period to verify correct operation.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The audio is streamed to the car stereo (or other HFP device) through a protocol normally used for voice (phone calls). Therefore, the audio frequency range output will not be the same as using A2DP protocol. This is a limitation of the hardware/protocol and NOT the app. The only way to change this is to buy different (and expensive!) hardware. Please test and make sure you are satisfied before you purchase. We want you to love it, and we are sure you will!"

      "label": "We believe that everyone can make music, even if you haven't had any experience.\n\nMusic Maker Go (MMG) is a tool to help you make quick music clips anytime and anywhere. It is easy to use even if you have never experienced any professional DAW. Best for inspiration records or making beats while hanging out with your friends. You could also learn how to make good music by looking into the templates already embedded in the app.\n\n-- Packs of music samples to get you quick start\nIf you don't know how a music is made, don't worry. Each time you create a new music clip, you can start from choosing a premade music pack, which may consist of two or more tracks. You can listen to the previews and then go to the edit mode, where you can see how many tracks needed for this music clip and how each note was composed in each track. We prepared a bunch of free music packs for new beginners. For premium users, you can try our monthly or yearly plan to access all musicpacks, all templates, and all sounds without any ADs.\n\n-- Hundreds of templates help you quick fill music notes\nYou can manually fill each music note in your own will, or you can choose a template from the idea panel, and do your own imagination based on that. Hundreds of templates provided in the app can let you make a short music even in just a few minutes (literally). What's more, most of these templates are completely free to use.\n\n-- Easy switch of different sounds for same notes\nIt's so fun to hear each different version of a popular song. In our app you can easily achieve that by a simply switch of sound pack. Piano could be classic, but how about play with Electric-guitar or even synthesizer. Use your imagination.\n\n-- Good supports for either new or old hands\nEveryone can make music, including those who have never tried to make one. You don't need to know a bulk of musician knowledge before you start. Each part in this app is designed to be easily recognizable and understandable. Just spend a few minutes and you will get how to master the whole process.\n\n-- Music genres we support for now (still growing)\nRemix\nTrap / Beats (with 808 drum preset but you can manually choose other EDM drum sets)\nDubstep EDM\nHouse EDM\nTrance EDM\n\nTo be specific, we support those features while composing music:\n1) full range of keyboard, up to C7, down to C-2\n2) manually swipe to any place on the track, and then type or delete any music notes\n3) you can also keep the track playing and type notes on the go\n4) all notes are automatically aligned\n5) tracks are divided into five different categories (Drum / Lead / Chords / Bass / FX) with preset best-fit keyboards\n6) Easily change sound effect for your keyboard with more than 100 sounds embedded\n7) To make your keyboard clean and clear, we prepared 12 different keyboard layouts arranged by different scales which you can easily switch from one to another by one click.\n8) and etc. (too much to write down them all, waiting for you to explore)\n\nWe're a small team but take music as life. We'd love to know ideas or complaints you met while using our app. Our aim is that everyone can make short music easily, without having to learn music theories for many years. Life should be simple and full of music.\n\nIf you would like to talk with us, please don't hesitate to send us an email: easymusicmaker@gmail.com, looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nhttps://easymusic.app/\nhttps://easymusic.app/privacy.html"

Now two pairs of Bose® wireless headphones can share the experience - listen together, at the same time, while one of you DJ’s. New PARTY MODE lets you sync two SoundLink® speakers for double the audio…ideal for listening in two different places, and new STEREO MODE immerses you in music by separating the sound into Left and Right channels across two paired speakers for that amazing stereo experience.\n\nGET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR HEADPHONES\nCONTROLLABLE NOISE CANCELLATION on our QC®30 headphones lets you decide how much of the world to let in by adjusting the level of noise cancellation right in the app. And the built-in HEART RATE MONITOR for our SoundSport® Pulse headphones displays your heart rate clearly in the app.\n \nAND SO MUCH MORE\nFrom viewing product details to personalizing settings, get the most out of your Bose wireless products. It even downloads the latest software in the background and only installs it when you’re ready. See how our simple app can make all the difference.\n \n * NOTE * \nBose Connect works with Bose Frames, QC®35, SoundSport® wireless, SoundSport® Pulse wireless, SoundSport® Free wireless, QuietControl™ 30, SoundLink® wireless II, ProFlight® headphones, and SoundWear Companion speaker, SoundLink® Color II, SoundLink® Revolve, SoundLink® Revolve+, SoundLink® Micro, and S1 Pro® speakers   \nSome features may not be available for all products.\nThe Bluetooth® word mark and logos are registered trademarks owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc. and any use of such marks by Bose Corporation is under license.\n\nhttps://www.bose.com/en_us/legal/california_privacy_notice_of_collection.html\n\nhttps://worldwide.bose.com/privacypolicy"

      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

On the 17th June 2004, Radju Marija started transmitting through the frequency 102.3FM a National Licence, reaching throughout Malta and Gozo.\nIn 1998 Radju Marija Malta joined World Family Radio Maria (WFRM), being the fifth country to join which today has more than 70 different countries making part of WFRM. Our aim is to promote Evangelical messages of joy and hope through the Word of God and to help better understanding of Christian beliefs and teachings. As part of the World Family of Radio Maria, the station embraces the same ideas as other Radio Maria stations do throughout the world. Thus the motto of WFRM and every radio station; ‘A Christian Voice in Your Home’.\nRadju Marija Malta is made up of one big family of people mainly volunteers who contribute their time to working in different areas. Radju Marija does not air any commercial advertisement. It depends entirely on donations sent in by listeners and above all through Divine Providence."

It is a sign of the Mercy of God in the heart of all Arabic speaking people and a sign of hope for all the suffering and persecuted Christians. \nThis station will be the voice to and from the Arabic speaking Christians in the Middle East and around the world, with their culture and the multifaceted religious heritage of the different churches to which they belong.\n\n\nThe main  purpose  of this project  is to give support and consolation to persecuted Christian community in Muslim countries at war such as Iraq , Iran , Syria.\n\nRadio Mariam Arabic will be the symbol of peace and reconciliation in the various communities in the middle east area, preventing these very ancient communities from  disappearing  because of deportations and forced displacement. Hence, Radio Mariam Arabic will spread their voice everywhere, keeping alive a great religious tradition which unites the whole Christian world .\n\nThe broadcast  of Radio Marian Arabic is made via web and via satellite from a central studio and from mobile studios spread all over the Middle East Region and managed by local dioceses ."

In spite of this acceptance, few of us “muslims” know what is written in the Quran. To clear this contradiction away, until we learn Arabic, we should at least reach translation of the Quran in our own language and try to understand it. That is why QuranRadio offers translations in 10 different languages. Making it easy to reach Quran and its translations.\nEvery moment of our temporary life in this world is precious, not to be wasted. At home, at work, at the street; anywhere and anytime that our mind and ear is free to hear and reflect, we can listen to the Quran! That is why QuranRadio is established in a radio format."

Our aim is to promote Evangelical messages of joy and hope through the Word of God and to help better understanding of Christian beliefs and teachings. As part of the World Family of Radio Maria, the station embraces the same ideas as other Radio Maria stations do throughout the world. Thus the motto of WFRM and every radio station; ‘A Christian Voice in Your Home’.\nRadju Marija Malta is made up of one big family of people mainly volunteers who contribute their time to working in different areas. Radju Marija does not air any commercial advertisement. It depends entirely on donations sent in by listeners and above all through Divine Providence."

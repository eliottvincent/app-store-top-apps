      "label": "The hidden gem for musicians.\n\nChord ai uses recent advances in artificial intelligence to find chords, beats and voicings for any song instantly and reliably. Chord ai delivers state-of-the-art accuracy beyond trained human level. You won't need anymore to look for the chords of a song on the web. You can select songs from YouTube, SoundCloud, your audio files or even use the device microphone. Chord ai is the new musician's best companion app. From beginner to pro level. Discover now the numerous features to help you improve your playing skills and your ear.  \n\n*** BROWSE ANY SONG ***\n- You can select any song by browsing your audio files, SoundCloud or YouTube. This is the preferred way and Chord ai will process songs within a few seconds.\n- You can also select a song on streaming services such as Apple Music or Spotify. In that case Chord ai will use the microphone to process the sound from your device in real time.\n- Or you can use your device microphone to get the chords of any song playing around you or from your own playing / your band's playing\n\n*** CHORD & VOICING RECOGNITION ***\n- Common chords recognition: Chord ai can recognize common chords such as major, minor, augmented, diminished, 7th, M7th, sus2 and sus4 chords.\n- [Pro version] Advanced chords recognition: Chord ai also recognizes advanced chords such as power chords, half-diminished, dim7, M7b5, M7#5, 6, 69, 9, M9, 11, M11, 13, M13th, add9, add11, add#11, addb13, add13, 7#5, 7b5, 7#9, 7b9, 69, 11b5, 13b9 and combinations of them such as 9sus4, min7add13 etc.\n- [Pro version] Chord inversions a.k.a. slash chords: Chord ai tells you more precisely the bass/lowest note of each chord using the slash notation. For instance, C/E means that the third (E) is played as the lowest note, or Am7/G means that the seventh (G) is played as the lowest note.\n- Voicing & Position recognition: Chord ai is the world's first app capable of recognizing not only chords, but also their specific voicing.

      "label": "Syntien is a customizable OSC (Open Sound Control) control surface for iOS.  It can recognize a variety of different input types, including touch, movement, and sound.\n\nIt comes with the usual variety of buttons, labels, sliders, and knobs, but adds much more to your toolkit with a unique set of controls.  \n  •  Use an adjustable, resizable Keyboard control to send MIDI note and velocity data.  Sending pitch information via OSC has never been easier!\n  •  The Touch Pad control takes full advantage of the many touch gestures on iOS.  Track five touches independently on on iPhone, and even more on iPad.  Transmit data including position, force (if your device has 3D Touch), speed, and number of touches.  Recognize Pinch gestures, Rotation gestures, Swipe gestures, and Long Press gestures, with unique visual feedback for each.\n  •  The Gesture control tracks shake gestures and orientation changes.\n  •  The Scope control uses data from your device's accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to transmit your device's acceleration, rotation, or nearby magnetic field strength.  Tie the device rotation to a smooth, continuous sound, or trigger interesting gestures with changes in acceleration.\n  •  Use the Sound Level Meter to track audio input levels, and use the Spectrogram control to detect pitch.\n\nCreate your own interfaces and modify the behavior of controls in-app, on any iOS device, without the need for a separate desktop editor!  You can use one of the built-in presets, duplicate one for a solid starting point, or build your own from scratch.  Place and resize controls exactly how you want them using intuitive drag-and-drop gestures.\n\nModify your interfaces mid-performance with OSC messages from your computer!  Add controls, remove controls, or adjust their behavior with the click of a button.  Incoming OSC messages are displayed on the screen and color-coded, so you'll know exactly what messages Syntien is receiving and whether or not they're being interpreted."

      "label": "\"Probably the best map and route planner out there\" - recent customer review\nDon't take our word for it, join over 1 million users who rely on this app daily.\n\n● TRAVEL AT NIGHT ●\n● Now contains routing for the latest TfL night services.\n\n● KEY FEATURES ●\n● Simple, fast and easy to use.\n● Designed for the first time visitor and experienced commuter.\n● Unique \"Travel Explorer\" feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map.\n● Latest official TfL (Transport for London) map. \n● Saves and recalls favourite and recent journeys.\n● Online street map integration (when an internet connection is available).\n● Services can be turned on or off, routing around problems.\n● Easily locates your nearest transport stop.\n● Places of interest, parks etc are built in to the application.\n● Ability to mark up the map with favourite locations and areas.\n\n● OVERVIEW ● The London Underground application is a superb route planner for the London Underground system with many unique features. The inbuilt map provides the official view of the city underground services with the ability to switch to an online street map view when an internet connection is available. This way the user can view the online map feature when above ground and the transport map and route planning is still fully functional underground or anywhere there is no internet connection. \n\n● TRAVEL EXPLORER ● The unique travel explorer feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map. This is helpful for getting a sense of scale and connectivity of the transport system and can provide some interesting results. For example is it quicker to use the tube to go from Covent Garden to Tottenham Court Road or is it quicker on foot? (Hint, the quickest route will keep you fitter). No other application makes it so easy to get around on the tube and allow you to make travel decisions based on the actual distances and travel times on foot.\n\n● ROUTING ● Does not require an internet connection and will always be available to display a clear and detailed view of the city transport system, plus list and animate the optimum route for your journey. Provides the fastest route calculations of any mobile routing application (virtually instantaneous) using actual published journey times with the ability to select the quickest route or the route with the least changes.\nComprehensive details of your planned route are provided, including changes, directions of travel, number of stops, predicted journey times, etc. Uniquely this application gives you “direction”, “towards” and “service frequency” information (not available on any other offline journey planner) for example “Take the Northern line (Southbound) towards Stockwell for 10 mins (6 stops). Service runs every 7 minutes” which is essential when finding the correct platform and connection. Also given are alternatives for each leg of the journey.\n\n● NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED ● The map and routing do not require an internet connection and you will not be charged data connection fees. This also means the application runs perfectly underground, on an aeroplane, etc. For international visitors to a city who have data roaming turned off this is an ideal solution.\n\n● LIVE INFO ● When an internet connection is available, optional \"Live Information\" on the current state of the transport services and real time station departure boards can be viewed allowing you to plan your journeys in advance and avoid any potential delays.\n\n● MORE MAPS ● This map is one in a series of Zuti worldwide city maps, if you like this product you may also enjoy some of our other offerings, please visit www.zuti.co.uk for further information. This is the promotional version of the application, please see the app store for the advert free version.\n\n● NOTE ● Please note this is the free promotional (Pro) version and does contain advertising."

This App gives you the ability to find out all the details of the ship, including size, speed, course, destination, estimated time of arrival and much more. All done with an easy to use and great looking App, which supports both iPhone and iPad.\n\nWhat people are saying about our App: \"Best user interface of any ship app I have tried\" B. Colson, Maine. \"Love the graphical design and the large icons that makes it easy to determine the ship type\" R. Clark, London. \n\nOpenSeaMap data is now accessible from within the app giving the possibility of showing the map data delivered by OpenSeaMap which includes seamarks, navigational rules and buoys in many areas of the world.\n\nFurthermore, you may measure the distance to the ships from your position, as you may measure distance between any two ships. This will show you if they are really on collision course or if it's just an illusion.\n\nSee the ships displayed on the map with large and crystal clear icons.\n\nBuilt-in compass and \"direction\" vector which helps find the direction of the ships and vessels. \n\nFurthermore, images of the ships may be watched or uploaded directly from the app.\n\nThis version supports iOS split screen multitasking found on selected device.\n\nAlso we added the possibility to place user defined waypoints on the map (press and hold your finger on map). The waypoints can be used as measurement points from the user or between ships. Furthermore, by pressing the waypoint the position is copied to the clipboard, making it easy to paste positions into other applications. Pressing the callout of the waypoint will prepare a text message with the position ready to send to other users.Once the text message is received the user can press it and get the position up in various maps apps. This functionality has been requested by search and rescue workers who would like a tool to help pin point positions to colleagues out at sea.\n\nMake sure to check out our FREE version of the app (Trackaship Superlite) before buying if in doubt about the coverage of you local area. The free version will show the same ships, but not any details.\n\nThis app depends on the data received via the Internet and is dependent on the Internet for displaying data. \n\nData is collected on a voluntary basis and may change without notice. If you live in an area with poor or no coverage, you have possibility to improve the situation. Send an email to bbmtrackers@gmail.com and we will contact you. \n\nPlease note that the accuracy and reliability of data in this app are not covered by any guarantee and that, under no circumstances should be used for navigation. This app is no substitute for proper maritime instruments."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "Getting around the city can be a challenge. Now there are so many transport options between trains, metros, buses, light rails, planes, ferries or even scooters, bicycles, taxis and ride sharing like Uber or Cabify...it’s complicated. We have created an app that shows you how to move from A to B in a highly personalised way. We have the ultimate journey planner that has all city transportation. Our algorithm finds the best route, and can create routes combining the bus, train, metro, city bicycles, scooters, taxis and sharing services.\n\nBut it doesn’t end there. In some places like Malta, you can also use Meep to not only book your ride, but also pay directly through the app. You no longer need more than one app. Many users have already joined our mobility revolution. Meepers have access to all the bus, metro and ferry schedules, but also real-time information including arrival and wait times, diversions, delays or incidents. Meep displays all the transport nearby your location - shared, train lines and bus stops.

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

There are differences between the app predictions and the official Hydro office tide tables, as these are based on large numbers of constants that are not made publicly available.  The Hydro offices consider the harmonic methods used in this product appropriate for navigation.\n\nAlways consult tidal curves and take into account local weather (pressure and wind) and swell conditions, which can have a very significant effect on sea water levels."

Enhanced with OpenTripPlanner API on the official GTFS feed. It makes possible for planning trips even in Harjumaa, as well as stop timetables there. Searching is done with Photon geocoder: not as good as commercial options, but good enough, and free.\n\nInternet connection is required, otherwise the app will have no information to display. It uses just kilobytes of traffic, unlike most transit apps. Geolocation is strongly recommended, unless you like to scroll a map — a lot."

The app helps you navigate to your destination and as a cherry on top, you get to start a parking action upon arrival. All of this in a single app and throughout the whole of Europe. Making your life easier, safer and more efficient before, during and after your trip, Flitsmeister is your best friend! \n\nThere are several other ways in which Flitsmeister will make your life easier: \n\n• Mobile and fixed speed cam, speed check zone alerts; to save your hard-earned cash.   \n\n• Traffic jam alerts; check in advance whether you will be encountering a traffic jam on your route and start a new route if necessary. \n\n• Service vehicle alerts such as ambulances and fire trucks, to help you get out of the way calmly and in time so they can reach their destination more quickly.  \n\n• Accidents, roadworks, stationary vehicles and other incident alerts: allowing you to anticipate the situation safely and in time. \n\n• Matrix sign alerts: never miss a closed exit, opened rush hour lane or maximum speed instructions ever again. \n\n• Navigation: the right instructions to get from A to B, taking into account the current situation on the road or recommending a different route if disturbances are expected on your route.  \n\n• Paid parking: start a parking action upon arrival at your destination with the tap of a button. The app will recognise whether you are located in a parking zone to make sure you don’t forget to start the parking action. We will send you a notification as soon as you get back behind the wheel so you never forget to stop your parking action and never overpay. \n\n• Traffic lights: certain traffic lights in the Netherlands will send their current status to the app. The number of these ‘smart’ traffic lights will be increasing in the future, allowing us to show you a countdown for the green light and speed recommendations to keep you in the green wave. \n\n• Apple Carplay for Flitsmeister on the screen of your car: navigate to your destination even more conveniently by displaying Flitsmeister on the screen of your car. Of course, you will also keep receiving the usual alerts for speed cams, traffic jams and hazards during your trip. \n\n\nCOMMUNITY \nOur entire team is dedicated to making the app better and more complete every single day. We boast a robust community with over 1.7 million active users in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Flitsmeister’s traffic information is mostly composed by the community; you can submit reports and assess the reports of others. A total of almost 25,000,000 reports is submitted every year.\n\nGot any questions or comments? Send them over to support@flitsmeister.nl.

      "label": "Atlas Navi is a Drive to Earn A.I. navigation app that uses live video from your smartphone camera to analyze the road in front of you and automatically detect: \n- traffic in each lane (counting how many vehicles are in each lane in front of you) \n- road construction / road work signs \n- road closures \n- accident detection \n- police vehicles (some countries only) \n- potholes \n- available / free parking space\n\nThe app uses advanced computer vision (A.I.) algorithms to analyze the video feeds from your smartphone camera and detect all the above problems on the road. It does this in the background, without interfering with the navigation instructions. \n\nAtlas Navi analyses the road 25 times per second when used with the camera from your smartphone. It generates 100 times better data than other navigation systems, which helps reroute other drivers to avoid potential traffic congestion and dangerous situations. \nBased on these A.I. detections, the app reroutes other drivers on quicker, safer, and less congested routes. \n\nAtlas Navi only uploads to the server the relevant information for traffic optimization: the type of detections and the GPS co-ordinates of said problem. No images or videos are uploaded unless specifically enabled by the user. If enabled, it can store your road trip recorded videos in the cloud, but the default option is to keep them on your device. \nAtlas Navi rewards drivers who send traffic data with a small amount of $NAVI for each mile they drive if they have a 3D vehicle selected in the app and provide traffic data from their cameras.\n\nYou can of course use Atlas Navi as a standard navigation app, without turning on the smartphone camera or the A.I. detections. You will benefit from all the rerouting and information received from other drivers which will make your route safer and faster. \n\nCurrent features include: \n- Navigation module with very accurate address search function \n- Video recording of your road trips, stored in the cloud or on the device \n- Trip history with associated videos (if any) \n- A.I. camera view - see what the camera is detecting in real time around you. \n- Livestream your road trip by sharing a simple link (the others don't need to download Atlas Navi) \n- Car garage where you can select from 3D vehicles in your garage. Customize, change their color, and choose which one you want to drive with today. \n- Rewards system - get rewarded in $NAVI if others join your Driving Club \n- Driving Club - see the others who have joined your personal club \n- Wallet - rewards earned and spent\n\nAtlas Navi is adding more features on a bi-weekly basis and will keep you updated with the latest innovation in avoiding traffic using A.I."

      "label": "Find your current elevation, altitude, and height above sea level easily with this altimeter/barometer app.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Elevation Finder ##\n\r\n\r\nThis app helps you observe the elevations of all locations on the surface of the earth by simply touch and move the map around, or input the address/location name. You can also find the elevation of your current location by using online database, built-in GPS, or barometer on your device.\n\r\n\r\n\nElevation data benefits flood prevention, prediction of water levels in rivers, lakes, and seas, etc. Thus, knowing the elevation of places is very crucial if you are looking for a flood-free house, or planning for a hiking trip, and more.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\n## Could-based Altitude Data ##\r\nThe easiest way to find altitude of any location on earth. By simply point on the screen, you can get the elevation data from a coordinate location point. “Range Mode” is available for altitude comparison (by graph and line) of each point between two selected locations. \n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## GPS Altitude Data ##\r\nUse built-in GPS on your device to determine the altitude of your current location. The altitude data of the area you walked-through will be recorded and displayed as a multicolored line on the map. The colors presented on the line indicate different heights. Precision indicators (horizontal resolution and vertical resolution) are displayed on the screen.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Barometric Altitude Data ##\r\nUse built-in barometer on your device to determine the elevation of your current location. You can either measure the elevation from raw barometric data, or relative pressure from sea-level. Like GPS data, the result is displayed as a multicolored line.\n\n\r\n\r\nTo get the most accurate data, it is recommended to adjust the sea level pressure and temperature prior to the measurement, and set the offset or calibration value if necessary. \n\r\n\r\n\n## Standalone Barometer ##\r\nYou can use this app as a standalone barometer.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Air Pressure / Altitude Calculator ##\r\nAtmospheric pressure and/or altitude at your current location are calculated from known altitude, pressure of the location, temperature and/or sea level pressure.\r\n\r\n\n## Support of Coordinate Formats ##\r\nThis app not only displays regular latitude and longitude data, but also supports many coordinate systems such as, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) and more.\r\n\r\n## Export of Data ##\r\nFrom this app, you can export many useful information including timestamp, altitude, pressure, and coordinates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSubscription\n-------------\nElevation - Sea Level Map  is completely free to use with all features. You can subscribe to this application to remove ads and reduce data retrieving delay by 50%.\n\nDevice subscriptions are available in these plan and will renew automatically each month, six months or year, unless cancelled.\n\n(Per month) - $4.49\n(Per six-months) - $25.99\n(Per year) - $48.99\n\nPricing shown is for the United States store. Pricing in other stores will vary.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n\nSubscriptions may be managed by going to your iTunes Account Settings after purchase or by clicking the “Purchase / Manage Subscription. Auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase.\n\nSubscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period\n\nMore information: https://mapnitude.com/elevation\nPrivacy policy: https://mapnitude.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://mapnitude.com/terms-of-service"

      "label": "GPX Tracker is a simple to use but powerful tool that helps you to track your ways. If you drive a car, biking or even outdoor on a walking or hiking tour, GPX Tracker will be tracing your geo data.\nOnce developed as a creator for XCode compatible GPX formatted files, the feature list is growing but it is still as simple to use. \n\nConfiguration\nGPX Tracker has a simple configuration interface.\n* Distance Filter - specifies the minimum distance between two way points in meters.\n* Auto Stop - If you ever forget to turn off the recorder, don't mind. GPX Tracker figures out whenever you stop traveling and stops tracing your trip to save energy.\n* Reminder - If this feature is turned on, you will receive a message whenever you stop by for a few minutes to remind you on stopping the track tracing.\n\nTrip Tracking\nThe main screen has a start/stop button. Simply press this button once for tracing a new trip and a second time whenever you want to stop recording data.\nOn the top of the screen, you will see the traveled miles or kilometers depending on your locale system configuration.\nWith the menu bar item on the right side you can choose different user tracking modes for the maps. \n\nTracks\nThe Tracks screen provides a list of tracks recorded. The will show the date and time of recording, the duration of the trip and its distance.\nIf you tap on one of the trips, it will be displayed on a map. From there on, you can press the menu bar item on the right side to choose an export format and send the generated\nfile by email.\nBack in the Tracks screen, you can easily delete a recorded track by swiping the desired item from the right to the left.\n\nTrack Export Formats\nThere are two output formats available.\n* XCode compatible \"wpt\"-tag based GPX files. This format can be used for the iOS Simulator by added the generated gpx file to an XCode iOS Project.\n* Common GPX \"trk\"-tag based format. The track will consist of a collection of \"trkpt\" tags within a \"trk\" element. This format should be fine for any application that processes gpx tracks.\n\nGPX Tracker is free but ad supported. \n\nPlease note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. GPS will be stopped automatically, as soon as you stop recording a track."

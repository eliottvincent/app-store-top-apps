When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "\"Probably the best map and route planner out there\" - recent customer review\nDon't take our word for it, join over 1 million users who rely on this app daily.\n\n● TRAVEL AT NIGHT ●\n● Now contains routing for the latest TfL night services.\n\n● KEY FEATURES ●\n● Simple, fast and easy to use.\n● Designed for the first time visitor and experienced commuter.\n● Unique \"Travel Explorer\" feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map.\n● Latest official TfL (Transport for London) map. \n● Saves and recalls favourite and recent journeys.\n● Online street map integration (when an internet connection is available).\n● Services can be turned on or off, routing around problems.\n● Easily locates your nearest transport stop.\n● Places of interest, parks etc are built in to the application.\n● Ability to mark up the map with favourite locations and areas.\n\n● OVERVIEW ● The London Underground application is a superb route planner for the London Underground system with many unique features. The inbuilt map provides the official view of the city underground services with the ability to switch to an online street map view when an internet connection is available. This way the user can view the online map feature when above ground and the transport map and route planning is still fully functional underground or anywhere there is no internet connection. \n\n● TRAVEL EXPLORER ● The unique travel explorer feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map. This is helpful for getting a sense of scale and connectivity of the transport system and can provide some interesting results. For example is it quicker to use the tube to go from Covent Garden to Tottenham Court Road or is it quicker on foot? (Hint, the quickest route will keep you fitter). No other application makes it so easy to get around on the tube and allow you to make travel decisions based on the actual distances and travel times on foot.\n\n● ROUTING ● Does not require an internet connection and will always be available to display a clear and detailed view of the city transport system, plus list and animate the optimum route for your journey. Provides the fastest route calculations of any mobile routing application (virtually instantaneous) using actual published journey times with the ability to select the quickest route or the route with the least changes.\nComprehensive details of your planned route are provided, including changes, directions of travel, number of stops, predicted journey times, etc. Uniquely this application gives you “direction”, “towards” and “service frequency” information (not available on any other offline journey planner) for example “Take the Northern line (Southbound) towards Stockwell for 10 mins (6 stops). Service runs every 7 minutes” which is essential when finding the correct platform and connection. Also given are alternatives for each leg of the journey.\n\n● NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED ● The map and routing do not require an internet connection and you will not be charged data connection fees. This also means the application runs perfectly underground, on an aeroplane, etc. For international visitors to a city who have data roaming turned off this is an ideal solution.\n\n● LIVE INFO ● When an internet connection is available, optional \"Live Information\" on the current state of the transport services and real time station departure boards can be viewed allowing you to plan your journeys in advance and avoid any potential delays.\n\n● MORE MAPS ● This map is one in a series of Zuti worldwide city maps, if you like this product you may also enjoy some of our other offerings, please visit www.zuti.co.uk for further information. This is the promotional version of the application, please see the app store for the advert free version.\n\n● NOTE ● Please note this is the free promotional (Pro) version and does contain advertising."

If you want to know the ferry locations, launch this app and voila. One more tap and you can see the upcoming departures in a table view. \n\nIf you want lots of other information, the WSDOT app is a great resource.

      "label": "Getting around the city can be a challenge. Now there are so many transport options between trains, metros, buses, light rails, planes, ferries or even scooters, bicycles, taxis and ride sharing like Uber or Cabify...it’s complicated. We have created an app that shows you how to move from A to B in a highly personalised way. We have the ultimate journey planner that has all city transportation. Our algorithm finds the best route, and can create routes combining the bus, train, metro, city bicycles, scooters, taxis and sharing services.\n\nBut it doesn’t end there. In some places like Malta, you can also use Meep to not only book your ride, but also pay directly through the app. You no longer need more than one app. Many users have already joined our mobility revolution. Meepers have access to all the bus, metro and ferry schedules, but also real-time information including arrival and wait times, diversions, delays or incidents. Meep displays all the transport nearby your location - shared, train lines and bus stops. That’s why the press says:\n\n“Meep, The app to improve mobility in cities…” - Expansion\n“The kick scooter fever makes Meep even more valuable, the ‘Amazon’ of new urban transport…” - El Economista\n\nAll transportation, public and private, is more accessible than ever in Barcelona, Lisbon, Malaga, Valencia and Malta. Till now, we had to choose between the bus, metro or bike, but Meep is the first app to offer the option to combine any and all modes in the same journey, according to your preferences.\n\nMeep has agreements with all public operators where the app is available. This means all your updates and info through Meep for:\n \n•Transporte Metropolitano de Barcelona (TMB)\n•Área Metropolitana de Barcelona (AMB)\n•Renfe Rodalies\n•EMT Málaga\n•EMT Valencia\n•Carris\n•Malta Public Transport\n•Metro Málaga\n•Metro Valencia\n•Metropolitano de Lisboa\n•Ferry Valeta-Sliema\n•Comboios de Portugal\n\nIn cities that have shared transportation, you will find all of the necessary information including stations, locations, availability, battery levels and costs in Meep.\n•emov\n•ecooltra\n•Muving\n•NextBike\n•GoTo Mobility\n•Blinkee City\n•ioscoot\n•NextBike\n•TD+\n•Yego\n•Donkey Republic\n\nPublic Bicycles: In cities with public bikes, Meep shows all the information about bike stations and renting.\n•Malagabici\n•Valenbisi\n•TallinjaBike\n•Gira\n\nTaxi: You also have the option to reserve and pay for taxis from the app when you prefer to take a cab.\n•RadioTaxi España\n•HiCabs\n•iGO\n\nOther services. Users can discover the main leisure and tourist attractions in the city of Barcelona, and buy tickets through the online shop of Turisme Barcelona.\n\nReal-Time Arrival Times Whenever possible, arrival times are shown in real-time so that your journey is adapted to real, current conditions and you have the most accurate time table.\n\nNotifications guide you in real-time during your trip so that you don’t get lost. They keep you informed about any service issues or changes.\n\nTravel preferences allow you to customize suggestions about how you get around the city and to select the modes of transportation you want to see in your route searches\n\nPayments For cities where app payments are available, you can enter your VISA or Mastercard and easily pay for trips through Meep.

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "EV CHARGING MADE EASY\nIf you own an EV, you know how frustrating it can sometimes be to charge. AmpUp makes charging easy by enabling building and property owners to provide charging for their residents, workers, or people just passing by – seamlessly and hassle free. People like you!\n\nFIND CHARGERS NEAR YOU\nFind chargers nearby or on your route, see if they are available, and even reserve them ahead of time. Bookmark favorite chargers or enable notifications for when an occupied charger becomes available. Discover not only AmpUp powered chargers, but also chargers from other networks.\n\nCHARGE WITH A QUICK SCAN\nJust scan the AmpUp QR code on the charger with the app’s QR reader to start your session in seconds. Or check into a charger reserved at a location in advance. Some locations require special access, which you can request from the charger’s host. \n\nPAY IN APP OR SCAN RFID\nPay using a credit card or with a card in your phone’s wallet. Save your payment method so you can charge quickly and easily on any of AmpUp’s thousands of chargers. You can also link your existing RFID card or badge - or request a new AmpUp RFID card - to swipe and charge quickly without your phone.\n\nCOMMUNITY POWERED \nEach charger host sets the prices and policies for their chargers. AmpUp makes the policies and pricing transparent for drivers, so you can see what charging speed you’re getting and what you are paying per minute or kWh of charging. \n\nREMOTELY MONITOR AND GET NOTIFICATIONS\nSee how your charge is progressing right on your phone. Get notified when your session is done. Know exactly what you’re paying and how many kWh you have added to your vehicle. See charging session history and receipts. \n\nPRICES AND FEES\nHosts set their own prices and policies, and AmpUp handles payments on their behalf. Hosts sometimes set up idle fees, which promote charger availability by encouraging drivers to vacate the parking space after charging. Get push alerts before idle fees start with a reminder to move your car. \n\nPROFESSIONAL SUPPORT\nAmpUp provides customer support for drivers. If you have an issue, our support staff can get back to you within 24 business hours to address your charging or billing issue. Note that prices and idle fees are set by hosts, and AmpUp does not have any control over those fees or policies.\n\nBECOME A HOST\nMake money and help take polluting internal combustion cars off the road by installing AmpUp-enabled chargers at your place of work or residence.  Charging your car using AmpUp is only the beginning - get the app and become a host!"

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m.

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

      "label": "Sparky's E6B emulates a mechanical E6B Flight Computer, with significant additional capabilities.  The app provides digital readouts of values that would otherwise have to be eyeballed in a standard E6B.  The use of cursors and steppers enables the precision of a digital computer with the speed and intuitiveness of an analog computer.\n\nThe E6B is an analog computer invented in the 1930's by Lt. Philip Dalton, USN for purposes of training and flight calculations.  \n\nThe app can be used to perform calculations, or to practice and learn how to use a mechanical E6B.\n\nAdvantages of analog slide-rule E6Bs include the speed of entering data, and continous operation that can enable a more intuitive feel for how outputs change as inputs are changed.  If inputs are changed, it is simply a matter of a swipe or using a stepper to fine tune inputs, and outputs are updated simultaneously.\n\nAdvantages of digital E6B's includes precision, but as E6Bs are in reality often used to estimate data, this precision often cannot be taken advantage of.  Furthermore, entering data is slowed down by soft keypads popping up and down.  It may be hard to understand how outputs change in response to inputs if individual numbers need to be entered on a keypad.\n\nSparky's E6B provides the best of both worlds.  The speed and intuitive entry of an analog E6B, along with the digital readout of a digital E6B.\n\nThe \"slide rule\" or \"front\" side includes a circular log-log scale that can be used for multiplication, division, fuel consumption and time/speed/distance calculations.  There are also various conversions available, such as nautical-miles/statute-miles/kilometers, fuel and oil volume and weight.  The windows on the front are used for airspeed, various forms of \"altitude' and mach number calculations.\n\nDigital output is provided for\n- Multiplication and division\n- Ascent and descent vertical and horizontal speed and angles\n- Rate problems such as gallons per hour, time to destination etc.\n- Density Altitude and True Airspeed calculations.\n- True Altitude Calculations\n- Mach speeds vs. temperature\n- Conversions of Nautical and Statue Miles to and from Kilometers\n- Volume of oil and fuel vs. weight\n- Conversion of Pounds to Kilograms\n- Conversion of Feet to Meters\n\nThe \"wind\" side is a vector computer used to determine flight headings, wind correction angle etc.   It also provides digital readouts to provide an intuitive feel for wind correction, as well as to let the inputs be fine-tuned or updated as conditions change.\n\nWe have no ads and collect no personal information.\n\nWe hope you enjoy Sparky's E6B and find it useful."

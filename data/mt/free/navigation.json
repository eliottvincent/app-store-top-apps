      "label": "Getting around the city can be a challenge. Now there are so many transport options between trains, metros, buses, light rails, planes, ferries or even scooters, bicycles, taxis and ride sharing like Uber or Cabify...it’s complicated. We have created an app that shows you how to move from A to B in a highly personalised way. We have the ultimate journey planner that has all city transportation. Our algorithm finds the best route, and can create routes combining the bus, train, metro, city bicycles, scooters, taxis and sharing services.\n\nBut it doesn’t end there. In some places like Malta, you can also use Meep to not only book your ride, but also pay directly through the app. You no longer need more than one app. Many users have already joined our mobility revolution. Meepers have access to all the bus, metro and ferry schedules, but also real-time information including arrival and wait times, diversions, delays or incidents. Meep displays all the transport nearby your location - shared, train lines and bus stops. That’s why the press says:\n\n“Meep, The app to improve mobility in cities…” - Expansion\n“The kick scooter fever makes Meep even more valuable, the ‘Amazon’ of new urban transport…” - El Economista\n\nAll transportation, public and private, is more accessible than ever in Barcelona, Lisbon, Malaga, Valencia and Malta. Till now, we had to choose between the bus, metro or bike, but Meep is the first app to offer the option to combine any and all modes in the same journey, according to your preferences.\n\nMeep has agreements with all public operators where the app is available. This means all your updates and info through Meep for:\n \n•Transporte Metropolitano de Barcelona (TMB)\n•Área Metropolitana de Barcelona (AMB)\n•Renfe Rodalies\n•EMT Málaga\n•EMT Valencia\n•Carris\n•Malta Public Transport\n•Metro Málaga\n•Metro Valencia\n•Metropolitano de Lisboa\n•Ferry Valeta-Sliema\n•Comboios de Portugal\n\nIn cities that have shared transportation, you will find all of the necessary information including stations, locations, availability, battery levels and costs in Meep.\n•emov\n•ecooltra\n•Muving\n•NextBike\n•GoTo Mobility\n•Blinkee City\n•ioscoot\n•NextBike\n•TD+\n•Yego\n•Donkey Republic\n\nPublic Bicycles: In cities with public bikes, Meep shows all the information about bike stations and renting.\n•Malagabici\n•Valenbisi\n•TallinjaBike\n•Gira\n\nTaxi: You also have the option to reserve and pay for taxis from the app when you prefer to take a cab.\n•RadioTaxi España\n•HiCabs\n•iGO\n\nOther services. Users can discover the main leisure and tourist attractions in the city of Barcelona, and buy tickets through the online shop of Turisme Barcelona.\n\nReal-Time Arrival Times Whenever possible, arrival times are shown in real-time so that your journey is adapted to real, current conditions and you have the most accurate time table.\n\nNotifications guide you in real-time during your trip so that you don’t get lost. They keep you informed about any service issues or changes.\n\nTravel preferences allow you to customize suggestions about how you get around the city and to select the modes of transportation you want to see in your route searches\n\nPayments For cities where app payments are available, you can enter your VISA or Mastercard and easily pay for trips through Meep. In select cities like Malta, you can include travel pass cards or vouchers like the Tallinja Card or Explore Plus Meep.\n\nTrips contains your trip history along with a calendar so you’ll know how you traveled, from either work, home or any other location\n\nWe’d love to help you see transportation in a new way to create livable and sustainable cities. To achieve this goal, we work tirelessly to launch Meep in even more cities including Madrid, Zaragoza, Las Palmas & Bilbao.

      "label": "\"Probably the best map and route planner out there\" - recent customer review\nDon't take our word for it, join over 1 million users who rely on this app daily.\n\n● TRAVEL AT NIGHT ●\n● Now contains routing for the latest TfL night services.\n\n● KEY FEATURES ●\n● Simple, fast and easy to use.\n● Designed for the first time visitor and experienced commuter.\n● Unique \"Travel Explorer\" feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map.\n● Latest official TfL (Transport for London) map. \n● Saves and recalls favourite and recent journeys.\n● Online street map integration (when an internet connection is available).\n● Services can be turned on or off, routing around problems.\n● Easily locates your nearest transport stop.\n● Places of interest, parks etc are built in to the application.\n● Ability to mark up the map with favourite locations and areas.\n\n● OVERVIEW ● The London Underground application is a superb route planner for the London Underground system with many unique features. The inbuilt map provides the official view of the city underground services with the ability to switch to an online street map view when an internet connection is available. This way the user can view the online map feature when above ground and the transport map and route planning is still fully functional underground or anywhere there is no internet connection. \n\n● TRAVEL EXPLORER ● The unique travel explorer feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map. This is helpful for getting a sense of scale and connectivity of the transport system and can provide some interesting results. For example is it quicker to use the tube to go from Covent Garden to Tottenham Court Road or is it quicker on foot? (Hint, the quickest route will keep you fitter). No other application makes it so easy to get around on the tube and allow you to make travel decisions based on the actual distances and travel times on foot.\n\n● ROUTING ● Does not require an internet connection and will always be available to display a clear and detailed view of the city transport system, plus list and animate the optimum route for your journey. Provides the fastest route calculations of any mobile routing application (virtually instantaneous) using actual published journey times with the ability to select the quickest route or the route with the least changes.\nComprehensive details of your planned route are provided, including changes, directions of travel, number of stops, predicted journey times, etc. Uniquely this application gives you “direction”, “towards” and “service frequency” information (not available on any other offline journey planner) for example “Take the Northern line (Southbound) towards Stockwell for 10 mins (6 stops). Service runs every 7 minutes” which is essential when finding the correct platform and connection. Also given are alternatives for each leg of the journey.\n\n● NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED ● The map and routing do not require an internet connection and you will not be charged data connection fees. This also means the application runs perfectly underground, on an aeroplane, etc. For international visitors to a city who have data roaming turned off this is an ideal solution.\n\n● LIVE INFO ● When an internet connection is available, optional \"Live Information\" on the current state of the transport services and real time station departure boards can be viewed allowing you to plan your journeys in advance and avoid any potential delays.\n\n● MORE MAPS ● This map is one in a series of Zuti worldwide city maps, if you like this product you may also enjoy some of our other offerings, please visit www.zuti.co.uk for further information. This is the promotional version of the application, please see the app store for the advert free version.\n\n● NOTE ● Please note this is the free promotional (Pro) version and does contain advertising."

      "label": "Speedometer by HUDWAY offers a brand new way to control speed when driving. A remedy against the speeding tickets, the app keeps you aware on what speed limitation is set for the current road section and alerts when you're exceeding it.\n\nThe app is straight and handy, with no tricky settings. Launch the app and place the phone onto the dashboard close to the windshield (if you want to use it in Head-Up Display or HUD mode and see the reflection on the windshield), or into the mount (for standard use).  It's specifically designed to offer you a safe and non-distracting visual assistance.\n\nPerfectly works in the background — tracks your speed and gives sound alerts when you're exceeding, even when you're using some other app (for example, some navigation one).\n\nHUDWAY Speedometer is a good company in any journey as it:\nKnows current speed limitation (both within cities and on highways);\nWorks in both standard and HUD mode. HUD mode allows using your smartphone or tablet as a projector. Just place your device close to the windshield, and the screen image will get reflected and displayed on the windshield. Keep your eyes on the road — everything you need is displayed right in front of you!\nDoesn't require much attention. The app is designed to be comfortably used without direct focus on it. Your peripheral sight will be enough to keep you aware.\nAlerts on sped limits, as well as on speed cameras and radars.\nDoesn't need Internet connection to work. Needs Internet only at first launch.\nIt simply works. And does it very neatly!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $4.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

      "label": "Scenic is the number one Motorcycle Navigation App. It’s a genuine alternative to expensive motorcycle GPS units like the Garmin Zumo and TomTom Rider.\n\nWith Scenic, you can plan, navigate, track, share and organize your motorcycle adventures. With its offline maps, unrivaled on-device route planner, vast database of beautiful routes, and curvy routing modes, it’s the complete all-in-one solution. \n\nPreparing your trips, navigating your routes, and recording your adventures has never been easier, all from the palm of your hand.\n\nPLAN\nPlan routes by dropping via points and stops. Scenic will show you a route between them. Don't like it? Choose another routing mode, including curvy!\n\nDISCOVER \nScenic has a vast database of thousands of beautiful routes, shared and rated by local Scenic users worldwide. Select an area, tap 'Search' and see what comes up.\n\nEXPLORE\nYet another way to get a great route... set the distance, then let Scenic generate a round trip for you in any given direction. Or a curvy route to a destination of your choosing.\n\nIMPORT \nFound a great route online? Have some laying around in Basecamp? Whether it’s a Google Maps URL or a GPX, KML, KMZ, GDB or ITN file, import it into Scenic to keep all your routes in one app that’s built for adventure.\n\nRIDE\nOn-screen instructions, voice guidance and customisable detour behaviour mean you can forget about the map and focus on the ride. When you do need to tap in, Scenic is designed to work seamlessly with your touch-enabled gloves.\n\nGO OFFLINE \nNo data/reception? No problem. Scenic’s offline maps mean you can go where others turn back.\n\nTRACK\nScenic not only navigates you, it also logs your location, speed and elevation, so you can relive every moment.\n\nSHARE\nLeave pictures and comments for other riders in the app, get a personalised web page of all your routes and rides, or share your journey straight to social media. \n\nLEARN\nHow much have I been riding on my old Yamaha? Have I been riding less this year? What was my overall average speed this week? How many rides have I done this month? Scenic will tell you.\n\nCONNECT\nScenic is the easiest way to ride to destinations unknown. So why not meet some like-minded riders along the way? Connect with thousands of other Scenic app users and buddy up for group trips.\n\n\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n* Scenic has an optional Premium Subscription that gives you access to Premium Features (Voice Guidance, Route Import & Route & Trip export, Round Trip Generation Better Search Results and Elevation Profiles).

You just have to turn on the GPS, enter the acceleration measurement menu and wait for a satellite fix. The app automatically detects if you are stationary or moving, so you just have to go. Once the mark(100 for km/h, 60 for mph) is reached the timer will stop. If you stop again the timer will restart and you can perform the test again."

This App gives you the ability to find out all the details of the ship, including size, speed, course, destination, estimated time of arrival and much more. All done with an easy to use and great looking App, which supports both iPhone and iPad.\n\nWhat people are saying about our App: \"Best user interface of any ship app I have tried\" B. Colson, Maine. \"Love the graphical design and the large icons that makes it easy to determine the ship type\" R. Clark, London. \n\nOpenSeaMap data is now accessible from within the app giving the possibility of showing the map data delivered by OpenSeaMap which includes seamarks, navigational rules and buoys in many areas of the world.\n\nFurthermore, you may measure the distance to the ships from your position, as you may measure distance between any two ships. This will show you if they are really on collision course or if it's just an illusion.\n\nSee the ships displayed on the map with large and crystal clear icons.\n\nBuilt-in compass and \"direction\" vector which helps find the direction of the ships and vessels. \n\nFurthermore, images of the ships may be watched or uploaded directly from the app.\n\nThis version supports iOS split screen multitasking found on selected device.\n\nAlso we added the possibility to place user defined waypoints on the map (press and hold your finger on map). The waypoints can be used as measurement points from the user or between ships. Furthermore, by pressing the waypoint the position is copied to the clipboard, making it easy to paste positions into other applications. Pressing the callout of the waypoint will prepare a text message with the position ready to send to other users.Once the text message is received the user can press it and get the position up in various maps apps. This functionality has been requested by search and rescue workers who would like a tool to help pin point positions to colleagues out at sea.\n\nMake sure to check out our FREE version of the app (Trackaship Superlite) before buying if in doubt about the coverage of you local area. The free version will show the same ships, but not any details.\n\nThis app depends on the data received via the Internet and is dependent on the Internet for displaying data. \n\nData is collected on a voluntary basis and may change without notice. If you live in an area with poor or no coverage, you have possibility to improve the situation. Send an email to bbmtrackers@gmail.com and we will contact you. \n\nPlease note that the accuracy and reliability of data in this app are not covered by any guarantee and that, under no circumstances should be used for navigation. This app is no substitute for proper maritime instruments."

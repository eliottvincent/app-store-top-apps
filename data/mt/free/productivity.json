      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

Back up and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

We automatically organize all the things life throws at you, like receipts and attachments, so you can find what you need fast. Plus, we've got your back with other convenient features like one-tap unsubscribe, free trial expiration alerts and package tracking. \n\nFavorite features:\n\n• One-tap unsubscribe from pushy promos\nSkip the tiny unsubscribe links at the end of long emails. We organize all your mailing lists in one spot, so it’s easy to unsubscribe from noisy newsletters and promos with a quick tap. \n\n• Organize and navigate your inbox with ease\nFind what you need fast with inbox filters that sort your emails by attachments, starred, unread, and more. Stay organized and clear out the junk by deleting or moving up to 10,000 emails at once from a particular sender or category. \n\n• Quickly spot receipts & package delivery updates\nSee all your receipts organized in one place so you can easily find the one you're looking for. Plus, see the status of all your upcoming deliveries at a glance. Top-of-inbox package tracking alerts means you'll never miss a delivery. \n\n• Pull up the best deals from your inbox\nNo more searching through countless promotional emails to find those savings. This view organizes your inbox around your favorite stores and the categories you shop. Now, find all your favorite deals—without the clutter.\n\n• Keep tabs on your free trials\nGet reminders before free trials expire—so you can update your subscription plan or cancel before the subscription trial ends. \n\n• Customize your notifications\nChoose which notifications you really need and say bye-bye to the ones you don't. You can turn on alerts for emails from people, bills & receipts, deals, travel, reminders or general messages. \n\n• Connect your other accounts\nBring your Gmail, AOL, or Microsoft accounts and take advantage of extra features. Set your own swipe actions, change up the sounds or swap in your favorite color. (We like purple)\n\n• Accessibility\nMaking sure our products are accessible is a priority. Yahoo Mail has high contrast themes, dynamic text resizing and VoiceOver screen reader compatibility. Plus, folders at the bottom of the inbox allow assistive technology users to navigate with less effort.\n\n• 1,000GB free storage\nThat's 985 more than some other inboxes, just sayin. ;) Download the app and enjoy a more spacious inbox.\n\n• Yahoo Mail Plus \nGet ad-free mail, extra organization and privacy features, plus 24/7 tech support across your iOS mobile devices.\n\n+        Available as an in-app purchase at $1.99/month charged to your iTunes account\n+        Subscription will auto-renew each month within 24 hours of your renewal date\n+        Manage or cancel your subscription via Account Settings\n\nTerms of service: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/index.html\nPrivacy policy: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.html\n\nHow are we doing?

Losing your password and the account Recovery Key will result in lost access to your files.\n\nUse the included MEGA Secure Chat for end-to-end-encrypted communications, including video and audio calls, with total privacy. Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency. The code of our iOS mobile app is located at: https://github.com/meganz/ios\n\nSubscriptions renew automatically for successive periods of the same duration at the same price as the initial period chosen. You can cancel the automatic renewal of your MEGA Pro subscription no later than 24 hours before your next subscription payment is due, via your iTunes account settings page. To manage your subscriptions, tap on the App Store icon on your device, sign in with your Apple ID at the bottom of the page (if you haven’t already done so) and then tap View ID. You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions. From there, you can select your MEGA Pro subscription and view your scheduled renewal date, choose a different subscription package or toggle the on-off switch to off to disable the auto-renewal of your subscription.\n\nTerms of Service: https://mega.io/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://mega.io/privacy"

You can use the myGovID app to sign in to your myGov account.\n\nSet up your myGovID in three easy steps:\n1. Download the myGovID app\n2. Enter your details – including your full name, date of birth and a personal email address that only you have access to.\n3. Verify your identity to increase your identity strength. There are three identity strengths – Basic, Standard or Strong. Increasing your identity strengths allows you to access more services and better protects your identity.\nIncrease your identity strength by verifying your Australian identity documents, like your passport, driver’s licence and Medicare card. These documents are checked against existing government records. You can also choose to verify you photo, this is a one-off face verification check, to further increase your identity strength. The app scans your face to check that you’re a real person, the right person and verifying in real time.\nYou need to be 15 years or older to set up a myGovID. However, age restrictions may also apply to use some government online services. To find out if you’re eligible to use a particular service, check its terms of use.\nYour personal information won’t be shared without your permission - putting you in control. myGovID is accredited under the Australian Trusted Digital Identity Framework which strictly controls how your identity data is collected, stored and used. It uses encryption technology as well as the security features in your device, such as fingerprint, face and password. This is to protect your identity and help prevent other people accessing your information.\n\nYour myGovID is unique to you – don’t share it with others.\n\nIf you need help or more information visit www.myGovID.gov.au"

As you work hard, the seed will grow into a healthy tree. Let the tree be your coach and grow yourself with it. You will be amazed by how great you can be.\n\nFOCUS TREES\n\nHave trouble putting down the phone? Flora blocks distracting apps in a pleasant way to help you focus on what’s more important in real life. If you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app while growing a tree, the tree will be killed! But if succeeding, you'll unlock new trees.\n\nDOUBLE EFFICIENCY WITH FRIENDS \n\nThings get even more interesting when you challenge your friends to plant trees together—you will see who kills a tree (ouch). However, if you successfully stay away from your phones together, each of you will win an additional tree from a random friend. You can also chat and share your progress to motivate each other and keep everyone on track.*\n\n* Flora is the original app for multi-user tree planting and delivers the best features that help you and your friends be productive. \n\nTO-DO LIST & WIDGET\n\nFlora is a to-do list, and more. Simply create a to-do item and set a reminder, then you will never forget a thing. Even better, you can tag your trees with a to-do item to easily track the progress towards each of your life goals.

You can remotely control your home and office by issuing intrusion and home-automation commands conveniently from your mobile device, anytime, anywhere. InimHome supports all display sizes and provides an interface with intuitive icons that facilitate operations.  The array of functions is complete: with just a few taps you can arm, disarm or partly disarm the intrusion alarm system, access scenarios, check the status of detectors, outputs and any system faults, read the events log; you can also activate air conditioners, sprinklers, lights and much more. Through InimHome it is possible to control multiple SmartLiving, Prime and Sol systems: thanks to the multi-panel management function you can interact with numerous systems, without limits. In this way you can control all of your systems in a collective way (home, office, business premises and so forth). InimHome also offers the chronothermostat function which allows you to adjust the temperature of the different ambients. Interaction with cameras is also possible and permits video verification in real-time: InimHome allows you to associate one or more cameras to a zone and display on the smartphone the real-time video of the cameras activated in the event of an alarm in the zone. If cameras with ONVIF standard are used it is possible to manage the camera movements and zoom outs as well as view multiple cameras simultaneously.\r\nBut that is not all: with InimHome, by taking advantage of the potential of the INIM Cloud, you can receive push notifications regarding alarms, faults, arm/disarm operations and the connection status. There is also the possibility to create 'Sections' (e.g. Lights, Sockets, Shutters) and within each section create one or more 'Output Groups' (e.g. in the Shutters section you could have the 'First Floor' and 'Second Floor'; in the Lights section you could have the lights belonging to the various rooms such as the 'Kitchen','Bedroom', etc.). The activations can be controlled either all together or one at a time by entering the group.\r\nInimHome is completely free!"

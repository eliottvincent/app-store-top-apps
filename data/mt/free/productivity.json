      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance.  \n\nThis set of widgets can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define.  For example, a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your work day, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day.  This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\nActivity widgets require a paired Apple Watch\n\nThe app itself also includes a wide collection of tools, such as a weather app, a timezone converter, a calendar.  These tools can automatically launch based on the active widget tapped.\n\nNotes:\n • Widgetsmith optionally integrates with Apple Health.

Zero-log policy, traffic encryption, IP and DNS masking. These all mean that third parties are not able to monitor you any longer, and that your privacy is reliably secured from obtrusive website and ISP surveillance.\n\n+70 LOCATIONS\nOur high-speed VPN servers in 70+ locations all over the globe, as well as our enhanced KeepSolid Wise technology, allow you to freely surf the web without giving out a single piece of your personal information, including your current location. Don’t let websites discriminate you based on the way you surf the internet or the place you browse it from.\n\nTOTAL SECURITY\nWe offers a variety of VPN protocols, each with unique capabilities and strengths. Just choose the one you would like to try.

      "label": "The InimHome App provides remote control via smartphone of SmartLiving, Prime and Sol systems made by Inim™ Electronics. You can remotely control your home and office by issuing intrusion and home-automation commands conveniently from your mobile device, anytime, anywhere. InimHome supports all display sizes and provides an interface with intuitive icons that facilitate operations.  The array of functions is complete: with just a few taps you can arm, disarm or partly disarm the intrusion alarm system, access scenarios, check the status of detectors, outputs and any system faults, read the events log; you can also activate air conditioners, sprinklers, lights and much more. Through InimHome it is possible to control multiple SmartLiving, Prime and Sol systems: thanks to the multi-panel management function you can interact with numerous systems, without limits. In this way you can control all of your systems in a collective way (home, office, business premises and so forth). InimHome also offers the chronothermostat function which allows you to adjust the temperature of the different ambients. Interaction with cameras is also possible and permits video verification in real-time: InimHome allows you to associate one or more cameras to a zone and display on the smartphone the real-time video of the cameras activated in the event of an alarm in the zone. If cameras with ONVIF standard are used it is possible to manage the camera movements and zoom outs as well as view multiple cameras simultaneously.\r\nBut that is not all: with InimHome, by taking advantage of the potential of the INIM Cloud, you can receive push notifications regarding alarms, faults, arm/disarm operations and the connection status. There is also the possibility to create 'Sections' (e.g. Lights, Sockets, Shutters) and within each section create one or more 'Output Groups' (e.g. in the Shutters section you could have the 'First Floor' and 'Second Floor'; in the Lights section you could have the lights belonging to the various rooms such as the 'Kitchen','Bedroom', etc.). The activations can be controlled either all together or one at a time by entering the group.\r\nInimHome is completely free!"

With Simple Roster, you never have to bring a paper roster around, and you can simply check your roster anywhere as long as you have your phone around. Simple Roster is so simple that you will know how to use it in a minute. Using the app is simply intuitive, you will have your roster setup in the app in the first 5 minutes. All rosters and shifts are stored offline in your phone, which means even though you are in a remote area that has no connection, Simple Roster still operates. Simple Roster is designed to be simple and it gets you your information in the least amount of time and least amount of steps.\n\nWe understand entering roster electronically is normally \"a pain in the ass\", but Simple Roster makes it easy. As soon as your shifts are setup, then you can setup your roster. To setup a roster, simply pick a start date and start entering... few seconds later, you will see your roster displayed on the roster calendar.\n\nSimple Roster also offers a feature that you can enter your friend's roster. With this you'll know when is the best time for you guys to hang out when you guys are having a day off together.\n\nYou can also share your roster with your friends and families so they know exactly what date you're free and what date you'll be home late.\n\nWith Full Version, you can choose to repeat your roster over a period. So if you have a repeated roster every 4 weeks, all you need to do is to keep repeating that period and you won’t need to manually enter your roster any more. There is also “Note” function that comes with Full Version as well which you can add note to any calendar date you want. Last but not least, you can sync your roster to your iOS calendar so you can even check your rosters without opening Simple Roster"

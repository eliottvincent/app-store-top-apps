      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance.  \n\nThis set of widgets can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define.  For example, a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your work day, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day.  This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\nActivity widgets require a paired Apple Watch\n\nThe app itself also includes a wide collection of tools, such as a weather app, a timezone converter, a calendar.  These tools can automatically launch based on the active widget tapped.\n\nNotes:\n • Widgetsmith optionally integrates with Apple Health.  This data is used to display your step and activity if you select one of those widget types.  Permission for Widgetsmith to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.  \n• Widgetsmith includes an optional premium subscription.  This is offered on a monthly or annual basis.  If you choose to purchase a subscription your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\n• Access to Tide and Weather hosted data is only available to Widgetsmith Premium subscribers.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith_privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith-terms-of-use.html"

Backup and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

      "label": "Hello VPN is a private and secure VPN service with remarkable features. “VPN and proxy server companies are all the same” we can hear you saying. Actually it’s not always that simple. Hello VPN never ever keeps user logs, as it believes in absolute user privacy and internet freedom. Although a lot of VPN companies claim to have such a motto, it is not always the case, because of the binding regulations and laws some VPN companies are subject to.\n\nThat’s right, some countries may be subject to regulations of intelligence alliances like The Five Eyes (FVEY), The Nine Eyes, and The Fourteen Eyes Alliances. Although there is nothing wrong with that, having a company headquarter based in alliance countries may result in an obligation to keep user logs on a regular basis, contrary to the promise made to you by some VPN or proxy server companies! \n\nFortunately there are still light-side of the force VPN and proxy server companies abiding by their word, hence keeping no user logs! As you may have already guessed, Hello VPN is one of them. Thanks to Hello VPN being an Estonia based VPN service, such binding regulations and laws are not applicable to Hello VPN.\n\nNo doubt there are many reasons to use a VPN or a proxy server e.g. ultimate privacy, boosting gaming performance by means of a stable connection, accessing services available for only specific locations, fast video streaming, WiFi security, anonymous browsing aka incognito mode etc. No matter the motivation behind, you are all set with Hello VPN! Variety of VPN servers are optimized for different use cases!\n\nDid Hello VPN begin to appeal to you? The word “Hello” stands as a way of greeting to the free internet, and the word VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. Keeping your private information private, and keeping prying eyes away is the essential goal of Hello VPN. \n\nHow does Hello VPN work? HelloVPN works by routing your Apple device’s connection through private servers of HelloVPN rather than your internet service provider (ISP) directly, so that when your data is sent to the internet, it comes from the HelloVPN servers. That’s right, HelloVPN creates a private tunnel from your device to the internet, and basically hides your data through encryption.\n\n“But what are the proxy servers?” is a frequently asked question to our customer support. A proxy server is also a system that provides a gateway between users and the internet. “What is the difference between a VPN and a proxy server then?” occurs to be a common follow-up question. The main difference between a VPN and a proxy server is encryption. VPNs hide all your web activity, such as all the apps you use, websites you visit, using encryption. Proxy servers on the other hand, will only change your IP address on a specific session or on a specific app, but they won’t encrypt all your online activities. In other words, a VPN secures all your network traffic, while a proxy server works on an application level. A proxy server is also relatively suitable for browsing the internet, but it’s not as safe and secure as a VPN.\n\n“Is Hello VPN free?” You can get your secure VPN connection completely free by watching in-app advertisements within Hello VPN’s basic mode. You can also upgrade to premium mode anytime to remove in-app ads, and also to access all the extra network features. \n\nAbout Hello VPN Premium Subscription:\n\n*The subscription covers VPN usage.\n*Hello VPN subscription period alternatives are 1 week, 1 month and 1 year. \n*Based on your plan every 1 week or 1 month or 1 year your VPN subscription renews. \n*Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at only your confirmation.\n*Hello VPN subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off.\n\nYou can cancel your Hello VPN subscription anytime via this URL:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039\n\nHello VPN’s terms of use can be found via this URL on Hello VPN’s official website:\nhttps://www.hellovpn.app/en/terms-of-use"

      "label": "Galarm is a FREE social alarm clock app that enables you to create and share alarms and reminders with your contacts. It acts as your daily planner and enables you to manage your tasks efficiently.\n\nWhy you will love Galarm:\n\n•  ANY TIME, ANY DATE: Create alarms for any date and time and use Galarm as your mobile calendar.\n \n•  FLEXIBLE REPETITION: Set alarms to repeat hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly to efficiently manage your to do list. Create reminders for taking your medicine 3 times a day, your  yoga class every day, paying your rent on the 1st of every month and other such repeating activities.\n \n•  RING ON SILENT: Ability to ring alarms even when the phone is on silent.\n\n•  PERSONAL ALARMS: Set reminders for yourself such as morning wake up alarm and medication reminder. Add participants to alarms that you normally miss. Participants can remind you of your tasks, if you miss them.\n \n•  GROUP ALARMS: Use a group alarm as an event planner for outings, parties, or any other social activity. The alarm goes off at the same time for all the participants, and they can confirm or decline, and chat with each other to coordinate.\n \n•  BUDDY ALARMS: Create alarms for someone else (“buddy”) to remind them of things they need to do. Buddy is reminded of the task at the time of the alarm. You are notified to remind the buddy in case they miss the alarm. You will also be notified once the buddy marks the alarm done.\n\n•  NOTIFICATIONS: All your notifications and alerts in one tab.\n\n•  ALARM HISTORY: See the previous responses for repeating alarms.

      "label": "Tiimo is a visual daily planning app that helps you organize your life, stick to your routines, and work towards your personal goals.  \n\nYou can use it at home, in school and at work to support you in doing the things you need to do, in a visual and motivating way! Tiimo leverages the fact that visual information is considerably more effective than written information for many.\n\nTiimo is designed to be inclusive and helpful across neurodiversity, including for Autistic people and/or those with ADHD, and support executive function challenges like planning, organization, time management, and focus. Our features specifically support these areas. \n\n** KEY FEATURES ** \n\n+ A visual timeline supports time management and focus. \n\n+ Visual checklists help you keep track of each point on your list not only by text but also by using colours, emojis or icons. \n\n+ Ongoing reminders (notifications, vibrations and sound) halfway through and at the end of activities increase motivation and help with transitions.\n\n+ Pre-made routines, designed with common activities, that make scheduling faster.\n\n+ Choose between +3000 icons, including unique background colours, emojis, as well as the option to upload your own images.\n\n+ Joint-use function means the app can easily be used between family members, or an adult and a child. \n\n+ With one Tiimo subscription you can create up to five different profiles/schedules.\n\n+ NEW: Calendar integration with iCal (and others if synced), color theme picker, dark mode and flexible activities that you can \"play\", \"pause\" and \"resume\".\n\n** OUR USERS SAY ** \n\n“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.”\n\n“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized.  I have already recommended this app to multiple people/platforms!’’\n\n“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze. I always know what is coming next which reduces anxiety and helps me focus on what I am currently doing. The power of Tiimo is that they know their audience and build specifically for them. This makes such a difference. They listen and respond promptly, I can tell that they care about the community they build their app for. I’m excited to see this app evolve even more in the future.\"\n\nGet started with Tiimo today! \n\n- We financially support neurodivergent partners & creators\n- We are a small company on a mission to make a big difference\n- We are 100% ad free and proud of it\n\n** Price & General Terms ** \n\nTiimo offers a basic free version of the app, and a paid version with full access to all the Tiimo features. When you have chosen one of our plans and confirmed your purchase, the payment will be withdrawn from the credit card via your App Store-account after the trial ends. \n\nRenewal: Your subscription automatically renews unless you unsubscribe at least 24 hours before the end of your subscription period. You can always manage your subscription by going to the settings on your device after the purchase. \n\nWhen you subscribe for a year, we know you’ll be a customer for longer, so we can make Tiimo as affordable as it possibly can be. \n\n** SAY HI TO US ** \n\nFacebook, Instagram, TikTok or Twitter: @tiimoapp \n\nTerms of Use: \nOur detailed terms of service can be read here: https://www.tiimoapp.com/terms-of-use"

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

Share folders with your contacts and see their updates in real time.\n\nMEGA’s strong and secure end-to-end encryption means we cannot access or reset your password. You MUST remember your password and make sure to back up your account Recovery Key. Losing your password and the account Recovery Key will result in lost access to your files.\n\nUse the included MEGA Secure Chat for end-to-end-encrypted communications, including video and audio calls, with total privacy. Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency. The code of our iOS mobile app is located at: https://github.com/meganz/ios\n\nSubscriptions renew automatically for successive periods of the same duration at the same price as the initial period chosen. You can cancel the automatic renewal of your MEGA Pro subscription no later than 24 hours before your next subscription payment is due, via your iTunes account settings page. To manage your subscriptions, tap on the App Store icon on your device, sign in with your Apple ID at the bottom of the page (if you haven’t already done so) and then tap View ID. You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions. From there, you can select your MEGA Pro subscription and view your scheduled renewal date, choose a different subscription package or toggle the on-off switch to off to disable the auto-renewal of your subscription.\n\nTerms of Service: https://mega.io/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://mega.io/privacy"

Back up and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

You can remotely control your home and office by issuing intrusion and home-automation commands conveniently from your mobile device, anytime, anywhere. InimHome supports all display sizes and provides an interface with intuitive icons that facilitate operations.  The array of functions is complete: with just a few taps you can arm, disarm or partly disarm the intrusion alarm system, access scenarios, check the status of detectors, outputs and any system faults, read the events log; you can also activate air conditioners, sprinklers, lights and much more. Through InimHome it is possible to control multiple SmartLiving, Prime and Sol systems: thanks to the multi-panel management function you can interact with numerous systems, without limits. In this way you can control all of your systems in a collective way (home, office, business premises and so forth). InimHome also offers the chronothermostat function which allows you to adjust the temperature of the different ambients. Interaction with cameras is also possible and permits video verification in real-time: InimHome allows you to associate one or more cameras to a zone and display on the smartphone the real-time video of the cameras activated in the event of an alarm in the zone. If cameras with ONVIF standard are used it is possible to manage the camera movements and zoom outs as well as view multiple cameras simultaneously.\r\nBut that is not all: with InimHome, by taking advantage of the potential of the INIM Cloud, you can receive push notifications regarding alarms, faults, arm/disarm operations and the connection status. There is also the possibility to create 'Sections' (e.g. Lights, Sockets, Shutters) and within each section create one or more 'Output Groups' (e.g. in the Shutters section you could have the 'First Floor' and 'Second Floor'; in the Lights section you could have the lights belonging to the various rooms such as the 'Kitchen','Bedroom', etc.). The activations can be controlled either all together or one at a time by entering the group.\r\nInimHome is completely free!"

You must send photo/timelapse evidence by the time limit, or we take your money.\n\nA good example is the gym: I know I probably won't be able to wake up and be at the gym at 6am tomorrow, but if I have to submit photo evidence inside it by tomorrow or lose $10, I'll definitely be there!\n\nBased off the Habit Contract methodology explained in Atomic Habits, Forfeit is pretty much bulletproof at forcing you to complete the habits that are tough to motivate yourself to do. \n\nSome examples are:\n• I will hit 30km on my Peloton before 8AM, or I'll Forfeit $10\n• I will submit a photo of myself awake and downstairs by 9AM, or I'll Forfeit $10\n• I will submit a time-lapse of myself meditating uninterrupted for 30 minutes by 10AM, or I'll Forfeit $5\n• I will submit a photo of my completed history essay by 9PM, or I'll Forfeit $5\n• I will record a 10km run by 3PM or I'll Forfeit $5\n\nLaunched in Summer 2022, users have set 1000+ forfeits and staked over $10k+.\n\nMore features:\n\nAVERAGES: Stay above a certain percentage, or your money is lost.\nSELF-VERIFY: No need to submit evidence if you don't want to - just verify that you completed the task.\nRECURRING FORFEITS: Set forfeits to regenerate for up to 90 days, on any specific set of days that you want.\nMANUAL VERIFICATION: Our team manically verifies your forfeits - no need for an accountability buddy."

As you work hard, the seed will grow into a healthy tree. Let the tree be your coach and grow yourself with it. You will be amazed by how great you can be.\n\nFOCUS TREES\n\nHave trouble putting down the phone? Flora blocks distracting apps in a pleasant way to help you focus on what’s more important in real life. If you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app while growing a tree, the tree will be killed! But if succeeding, you'll unlock new trees.\n\nDOUBLE EFFICIENCY WITH FRIENDS \n\nThings get even more interesting when you challenge your friends to plant trees together—you will see who kills a tree (ouch). However, if you successfully stay away from your phones together, each of you will win an additional tree from a random friend. You can also chat and share your progress to motivate each other and keep everyone on track.*\n\n* Flora is the original app for multi-user tree planting and delivers the best features that help you and your friends be productive. \n\nTO-DO LIST & WIDGET\n\nFlora is a to-do list, and more. Simply create a to-do item and set a reminder, then you will never forget a thing. Even better, you can tag your trees with a to-do item to easily track the progress towards each of your life goals. No matter if your goal is daily, weekly, or monthly, Flora will help you follow it through and achieve it.\n\nHABIT TRACKER\n\nEnjoy a rewarding daily habit routine. If you grow trees regularly, you will earn yourself a beautiful, vibrant garden. Take a look at it and feel proud of yourself! Each tree records your perseverance and a step towards a healthy life. You can also view the daily, weekly, or monthly statistics of your activities in Flora to find opportunities to improve your time-management and planning skills.\n\nREAL TREES, REAL IMPACT\n\nWhy not plant REAL trees while improving yourself? Flora proudly offers the opt-in Price and Care services that let you plant real trees on the earth if you kill or successfully grow a tree in the app. We partner with tree-planting organizations in Africa and East Asia, such as the Trees.org, to plant fast-growing soil rebuilding trees, fruit trees that diversify incomes and nutrition, and trees that can provide forage and fuel-wood. All these trees help make the earth greener and provide long-term financial aid to families who need it most.\n\nSounds good? Download Flora and join our 2,000,000+ productive users now!"

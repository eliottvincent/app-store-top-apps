      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

Back up and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

Placing assets is fast and easy with familiar gestures to rotate, scale, and move.\r\n\r\nWith Aero, you can create interactive experiences without needing to rely on a developer. Apply behaviors to your content to build combinations of triggers and actions that draw viewers of your experience to drive the narrative and engage with the story. Add motion to your objects by using your mobile device to draw the path of motion you want the object to take.\r\n\r\nSwitch to Preview mode for fast feedback on how the edits you make will look and feel for viewers of your experience. Easily test how interactions and placement of your assets will enhance your scene and record quick videos or take snapshots of your work in progress so you share and get input for rapid iteration.\r\n\r\nWhether you’ve completed your design or still want feedback from other collaborators, Aero gives you the power to share your creations for easy viewing. Now that Adobe Aero supports App Clips, people can view your Aero experiences on iOS without needing to install the Aero app. Plus, Aero experiences load much faster than before, enabling viewers to dive right in and start interacting with your content. \r\n\r\nSend a link so people can interact with your creation in Aero on their own device in Viewer mode.

      "label": "Tiimo is a visual daily planning app that helps you organize your life, stick to your routines, and work towards your personal goals.  \n\nYou can use it at home, in school and at work to support you in doing the things you need to do, in a visual and motivating way! Tiimo leverages the fact that visual information is considerably more effective than written information for many.\n\nTiimo is designed to be inclusive and helpful across neurodiversity, including for Autistic people and/or those with ADHD, and support executive function challenges like planning, organization, time management, and focus. Our features specifically support these areas. \n\n** KEY FEATURES ** \n\n+ A visual timeline supports time management and focus. \n\n+ Visual checklists help you keep track of each point on your list not only by text but also by using colours, emojis or icons. \n\n+ Ongoing reminders (notifications, vibrations and sound) halfway through and at the end of activities increase motivation and help with transitions.\n\n+ Pre-made routines, designed with common activities, that make scheduling faster.\n\n+ Choose between +3000 icons, including unique background colours, emojis, as well as the option to upload your own images.\n\n+ Joint-use function means the app can easily be used between family members, or an adult and a child. \n\n+ With one Tiimo subscription you can create up to five different profiles/schedules.\n\n+ NEW: Calendar integration with iCal (and others if synced), color theme picker, dark mode and flexible activities that you can \"play\", \"pause\" and \"resume\".\n\n** OUR USERS SAY ** \n\n“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.”\n\n“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized.  I have already recommended this app to multiple people/platforms!’’\n\n“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze. I always know what is coming next which reduces anxiety and helps me focus on what I am currently doing. The power of Tiimo is that they know their audience and build specifically for them. This makes such a difference. They listen and respond promptly, I can tell that they care about the community they build their app for. I’m excited to see this app evolve even more in the future.\"\n\nGet started with Tiimo today! \n\n- We financially support neurodivergent partners & creators\n- We are a small company on a mission to make a big difference\n- We are 100% ad free and proud of it\n\n** Price & General Terms ** \n\nTiimo offers a basic free version of the app, and a paid version with full access to all the Tiimo features. When you have chosen one of our plans and confirmed your purchase, the payment will be withdrawn from the credit card via your App Store-account after the trial ends. \n\nRenewal: Your subscription automatically renews unless you unsubscribe at least 24 hours before the end of your subscription period. You can always manage your subscription by going to the settings on your device after the purchase. \n\nWhen you subscribe for a year, we know you’ll be a customer for longer, so we can make Tiimo as affordable as it possibly can be. \n\n** SAY HI TO US ** \n\nFacebook, Instagram, TikTok or Twitter: @tiimoapp \n\nTerms of Use: \nOur detailed terms of service can be read here: https://www.tiimoapp.com/terms-of-use"

Other 96% won't achieve them never...\n43% of people who write down their goals - achieve them. \nOnly 2% of people write down their goals. \n\nSo, by simply writing down your goals, you increase your chances by 11x.\n\nLife Wheel takes it a step further by enabling you to implement the \"Wheel of Life\" technique, the best-known way to visualize all spheres of your life. \n\nFrequently asked questions:\n\n1. How do I remove a goal or subtask?\nYou can swipe it to the left on main screen, and you will see Delete button. Exactly the same like for other iPhone apps.\n2. How do I configure the wheel of life (diagram) ?\nSimply tap on life sphere (part of diagram) and move your finger.\n3. How I can restore a goal that I accidentally marked as completed? \nWhen you scroll to the bottom of all your goals and tasks you will see an achieved goals button,  press it and you will see a list of achieved goals. Open the specific goal and uncheck the completed box.\n\nLifeWheel comes with an auto-renewable subscription. After a trial, you may purchase an auto-renewing subscription through an In-App Purchase. (If you do not maintain a subscription, the app will have certain restrictions - such as the inability to access your data across multiple devices.)\n• Auto-renewable subscription\n• Your subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and will automatically renew (at the duration selected) unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• A current subscription may not be canceled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n• Privacy policy and terms of use: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10-Dk5vDAovlA7nD6QKNCIZ4_9RKcsm76a8Yz-rOLXcM/mobilebasic"

Each prompt you give the AI will cost a certain amount of points, anywhere from 25-150 points depending on how complicated your prompt is, which will be deducted from your balance (default is 400 points). Once your points reach zero you will be shown a very quick ad and your point balance will be quickly replenished back to 400. You can keep track of your points by looking at the progress circle in the upper right corner and can get an exact answer by tapping on it. We'll be experimenting in the future with different starting balances to make sure user experience is still good, we would love feedback on this!\n\nIn the future we intend to add options to prioritize speed vs effectiveness and to specify is important to you for what the AI responds with. We also hope to add the ability to  generate images with prompts using a similar AI in the future inside of the app.\n\nNO SIGNUP REQUIRED! We believe in anonymity and don't see a need for you to give us any information so everything done in the app is completely anonymous.\n\nFeel free to hit us up at the email given below with any suggestions or feedback!"

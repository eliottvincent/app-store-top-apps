      "label": "#1 snooker coaching app! Keeps track of your frame scores, breaks, state of mind... your complete snooker log diary (matches, frames, breaks...). Helps you to improve your snooker game with an extensive list of practice routines and sessions. Using Augmented Reality (AR), practice routines are projected in real-time on your snooker table. You can also create your own custom practice routines using the built-in table editor and project them on your snooker table using augmented reality (AR)! Enter your practice results in the app and see your improvement, day-by-day. Contains a lot of widgets that you can put on your home screen to track your matches, frames, breaks, and much more.\n\nHere is what some players are saying about SnookerCoach:\n\n**** So much easier than writing my matches out by hand and working out the percentages for my stats. It's the best app for snooker practice\n\n**** It's great that you can enter your match and frame scores in the app. This motivates me to win the next time I encounter the same player.\n\n**** I am a beginning snooker player. The practice routines in Snooker Coach 147 motivated me to practice more and I do many different routines now, instead of always playing the same line-up.\n\n**** I used to go to my local club to 'knock some balls around' as practice. Snooker Coach 147 has helped me to practice more focused to complete each routine successfully. I am winning more matches and playing with more confidence."

There are several online directories where you can find the stations featured in the app.\n\nQ: Why does the stream occasionally skip?\nA: When stations are skipping, it is often because 1) that station's server has recently been reset or 2) the internet isn't filling the audio buffer fast enough. Usually these issues are resolved with faster internet, changing to a new station, or they resolve on their own after the server resets.\n\nQ: Why are some stations blank at times? \nA: Some of these stations are controlled by real DJs and if they aren't playing anything at the time or their site is down no music will play. Fortunately we have a variety of channels so you will always have a lot to choose from. \n\nFor more information, including Terms of Service & Privacy Policy, visit myindieapp.com.

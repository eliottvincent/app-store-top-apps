This app helps rally drivers to measure distance, keep time between time controls, take time on special stages, keep you near your target speed on TSD or Regularity rallies and much more. And the best thing, this app does not weight anything! A must be app for every rally driver, even if you own a professional rally trip as you never know when you might need a backup! Works well both on small and large devices due to automatically resizing texts.\n\nNow even more useful for TSD and Regularity rallies as there is two modes dedicated for them. You can define the special stages and keep just on time for the checkpoints. Be a Winner, use Rally Tripmeter!\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nRally Tripmeter offers a Free 60-Day trial, after which a licence is required to be purchased.\n\nRally Tripmeter offers One-Time Lifetime licence and a Annual Auto-Renew subscription licence (Prices vary based on your location and currency)\n\n– Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n– Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n– Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n– Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n– Privacy Policy: https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/12268178\n- Terms and Conditions: https://termsfeed.com/terms-conditions/92dc29b75473c27b4d9292d39eb154f4 \n– Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable"

But there are products out there, where you can put your iDevice into, to make it waterproof and still be able to operate it. In this way you can either mount it near your other instruments on your keelboat or strap it to your arm if you are sailing a dinghy.\n\nFeatures:\n\nMain View.\nHere you can see your 4 most important readouts, fore instance Heading, Speed, VMG and Performance.\n\nThere also is a lift indicator, showing you if you have been lifted by a wind shift, and graphs showing the development in your speed and VMG over a configurable amount of time and a permormance bar.\n\nWind direction.\nSet your wind direction by storing your heading while sailing on upwind on starboard and port tack, or simply type it in.\n\nStart view.\nHere you have your count down (including sync), and you can mark your starting line and iRegatta will calculate the distance to the line and indicate the favorite line end, if wind direction is set.\n\nStatistics view.\nView your current position and trip odometer and max speed since last reset. You'll also see a polar diagram with your speed and VMG (wind speed dependent).\n\nWaypoints.\nNavigate to your favorite pre-stored waypoints, or create a new temporary waypoint by cross bearing using the iPhone internal camera, or by distance/bearing.\n\nTracking.\nRecord your track and view it on the map or export it for further analysis to your computer.\n\nInstead of internal GPS you can get instrument information over WiFi from NMEA0183 instruments. (In-App-Purchase). \n\nAIS data received over WiFi will be displayed in a Radar-like view. (In-App-Purchase).\n\niRegatta also comes with a watch app, which will allow you to view data on your watch as well as operate the start line features. Besides that, the watch app will track your sailing as an activity and help you close your activity circles using HealthKit.\n\nRead more detailed information on the apps web page."

You can change your favorite leagues and teams in the app’s settings and even personalise the notification sound.\n\nBut there is more to TorAlarm than goal notifications and scores: You will find live standings and a table with the current top-scorers for all leagues, as well as line-ups and stats for single matches.\n\nEnough words for now - we believe that our app is very intuitive and easy-to-use, so there is no detailed instruction required. Just open the app and dive into the world of the biggest football leagues.\n\nWe love feedback! If you have any problems with the app, found a bug, or just want to share some ideas for improvement with us, send us a mail to: support@toralarm.eu\n\n------------------------------\nTerms of Use: https://toralarm.com/privacy#terms-of-use\nPrivacy Policy:  https://toralarm.com/privacy \n\nThe TorAlarm app is free to use. Optionally you can remove all ads within the TorAlarm app with the TorAlarm premium subscription . The subscription is automatically renewed, unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription.\n\nThe open amount will be withdrawn from your iTunes account once the transaction has been confirmed.\nIf you would like to cancel your subscription or opt out of automatic renewal, you can do so right after your purchase in your Apple ID account settings. The “Manage subscription” button takes you directly to the appropriate settings."

      "label": "The partner that makes you a better player. Master the game like a Pro!\n\nThe use of this application is associated with the purchase of the football training ball SenseBall.\n\nSenseBall is the football (soccer) ball with string developed by CogiTraining, the revolutionary football training method implemented in football clubs and Federations around the world such as the Belgian FA, AC Milan, RSC Anderlecht and FC Metz.\n\nRecommended by professional football players, SenseBall is especially aimed at young players between 6 and 20 years of age. Practising with SenseBall allows improving their football skills and becoming two-footed. SenseBall also improves the performance of all sportspeople for whom high-speed and precision of leg movements are essential (basketball, tennis, skiing, handball…).\n\nThe principle of SenseBall is based on the concept of bilateral activity. Thanks to its specific design, online exercise videos and didactical program, a player practising SenseBall will make an average of 500,000 touches of the ball in a season.\n\nIn a training session, a player uses his left foot as many times as his right and moves through space in a balanced way left/right and backwards/forwards. Whether done individually or in a group (and so rhythmically), the football training ball SenseBall enables developing specific football skills, reacting quicker and gaining in rhythm.\n\nSENSEBALL PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS\n> Improved brain timing : the key to a healthier lifestyle and better learning\n> Perfect ambidextrous performance (two-footed player)\n> Better mastery and control of the ball thanks to repetition (myelin)\n> Greater precision in moving with and touches to the ball\n> Improved perception and coordination\n> Improved attention and concentration (rhythm influences cognitive aptitude)\n> Improved group work and learning (team building)\n> Develops autonomous, self-regulated learning\n> Increases sensitivity to acoustic signals (sonification, the sound of the touch of the ball)\n> Forms the correct body positions for football\n> Prevents the development of postural problems (fewer chronic injuries)\n> Trains players’ kinesthetic ability (millions of touches of the ball)\n> Retrieval models and structures help the brain to learn better and more quickly\n> Improvement of each gesture and movement by visualizing it better (have a clear image of the movement in the brain before putting it into practice)"

The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

      "label": "Essential tools for ten pin bowlers and coaches including:  \n\n1. Angles & Targeting\n2. Axis Tilt & Rotation\n3. Ball Speed & RPM\n4. Observation Trainer\n5. Pattern Library\n6. Bowling Ball Arsenal\n7. Notes\n8. Score Calculator\n9. Spare Names\n\n---\n\n1. Angles & Targeting\n\nPlan & visualize a shot from the start of your approach to your target, helping you become more accurate and consistent.⁠ Add overlays, such as entry angle, focal point, distance markers, and save favorite shots.\n\nVideo mode can apply all the above to previously recorded videos, or use camera more when practicing, with up to 30sec delay, for continuous action replay of every shot.\n\n---\n\n2. Axis Tilt & Rotation\n\nTake a photo or video of your ball with a PAP (Positive Axis Point) marker and position it in the guide for your approximate axis tilt and rotation.  Great for working on control & consistency.⁠\n\n---\n\n3. Ball Speed & RPM\n\nIn simple mode use the start/stop button to calculate ball speed in real time.Advanced mode can load in a video for more accuracy, and rev-rate calculation.⁠\n\n---\n\n4. Observation Trainer\n\nWhen we let go of the ball, many of us immediately look up to see the end result at the pins. We don't see the journey the ball takes to, and through, the pins, so don’t see differences between pocket hits that do and don’t carry. ⁠\n⁠\nPractice ANYWHERE with the Observation Trainer and learn to focus on four key points of every shot that give you the info you need to make better decisions and start striking more.\n\n---\n\n5. Pattern Library\n\nInstant access to details & diagrams of hundreds of oil patterns, or enter your own custom patterns. Load any pattern into Angles & Targeting to plot your shot directly over it and plan how you'll attack the lanes.\n\n---\n\n6. Bowling Ball Arsenal\n\nSearchable library of over 1,500 balls and a way to manage your own arsenal. Organise balls into separate bags and keep track of information such as surface, layout, important dates and more. When looking for something new, use the Ball Library to find exactly what you want, with filters for brand, cover & core types, RG, Diff and more.\n\n---\n\n7. Notes\n\nKeep track of information about your game and equipment. Create general notes, or add notes from within most of the other tools, such as for oil patterns, your bowling balls, Speed & RPM readings, Observation Trainer scores and more.\n\n---\n\n8. Score Calculator\n\nWhether earning how scoring works, teaching youth bowlers how to score, or just giving your brain a rest at a Triple-X fun night, there's lots of reasons the Score Calculator can come in handy!\n\n---\n\n9. Spare Names\n\nJust for fun, tap the pins to see nicknames of common spares you probably don’t want to be leaving!\n\n---\n\n\n\"Every bowler should have Tenpin Toolkit on every device they own.  It’s an incredible information source and provides so many things to help you learn, get better and challenge yourself.\"\n\nTim Mack\nUSBC Hall of Famer & Storm Director of Global Relations\n\n---\n\n\"A brilliant app with tools to help you develop and learn different skills. The observation trainer is a great way to train your eyes to start watching your ball go down the lane\"\n\nVerity Crawley\nPWBA Professional & SCAD Team Coach\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\nPremium features can be unlocked with an in-app subscription.

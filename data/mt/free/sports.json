During every sailing race you’ll get to see the action up close, as each of the F50 catamarans have multiple cameras on board for real time video streaming. \n\nAs well as getting a virtual on board experience, you’ll also enjoy birds-eye views of the whole race, augmented with key information such as where the finish line is, how fast each boat is travelling and how far they have left to go. The SailGP app is your ultimate race companion, here to make sure you never miss a second of the action!\n\nPACKED WITH REAL TIME DATA\nSailGP is a world-first sailing competition based around innovation and technology. Each boat is fitted with 1,200 data points, tracking every second of the race and syncing with your SailGP app in real time. As the teams battle it out to reach the finish line first, you’ll be able to customise the app, to view the data and stats that interest you the most. From Wind Speed and Velocity Made Good, to Time To Mark and Leg Number, just tap any stat in the app to learn more.\n\nSWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT TEAMS   \nSailGP includes teams from Australia, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the United States and you can support your nation by following them through the race. Should you wish, you can switch teams mid-race, to compare how the other boats are getting on.\n\nCHANGE VIEWS AND CAMERA ANGLES   \nChoose how you view the race by tailoring the stats that you see on your screen. Depending on what interests you the most, you can select one of two views. Default mode includes a larger video with less stats or you can opt for Advanced mode which makes the video smaller and shows you lots more data.\n\nCOMPARE BOATS RACING HEAD TO HEAD  \nWant to see how your team is doing against another? No problem! With the SailGP app you can compare two teams together at the same time. You’ll be able to monitor the data, speed and performance of both boats, side by side, all on one screen.\n\nNO SPOILER MODE\nAs SailGP operates across multiple time zones, you have the option to turn off spoilers and hide all results until you have watched the race.\n\nAWARD WINNING SAILING APP\nSailGP has won multiple awards for it’s impressive technology and groundbreaking movements within the sporting and technology communities. Award wins include Best User Experience at the SportsPro OTT Awards and Best Innovative App at the Campaign Tech Awards.\n\nABOUT SAILGP AND IT’S COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY\nFounded in 2018 by Larry Ellison and Sir Russell Coutts, SailGP‘s inaugural season started in 2019. It’s objective? To redefine the sport of sailing.\n\nIt’s unique nation-versus-nation format sees the best sailors in the world represent teams from 8 different countries with 18 total Olympians and 16 Olympic medals combined. Each team will go head-to-head on identical supercharged F50 hydrofoiling ‘flying’ catamarans – the fastest sail racing boats in the world.\n\nFocused on setting a new standard within the sport, SailGP goes beyond its responsibility to just entertain, it uses its global platform to accelerate change to become a climate positive sport with advances in clean energy. Taking place in so many different countries, it pushes it’s premise of being a zero-carbon footprint sport, showing that sailing and environmental change can work together extremely well.\n\nDownload the SailGP app today #RaceForTheFuture.\n\nFIND US\nInstagram - @sailgp\nFacebook - @SailGP\nTwitter - @SailGP"

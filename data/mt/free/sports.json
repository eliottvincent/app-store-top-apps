      "label": "The partner that makes you a better player. Master the game like a Pro!\n\nThe use of this application is associated with the purchase of the football training ball SenseBall.\n\nSenseBall is the football (soccer) ball with string developed by CogiTraining, the revolutionary football training method implemented in football clubs and Federations around the world such as the Belgian FA, AC Milan, RSC Anderlecht and FC Metz.\n\nRecommended by professional football players, SenseBall is especially aimed at young players between 6 and 20 years of age. Practising with SenseBall allows improving their football skills and becoming two-footed. SenseBall also improves the performance of all sportspeople for whom high-speed and precision of leg movements are essential (basketball, tennis, skiing, handball…).\n\nThe principle of SenseBall is based on the concept of bilateral activity. Thanks to its specific design, online exercise videos and didactical program, a player practising SenseBall will make an average of 500,000 touches of the ball in a season.\n\nIn a training session, a player uses his left foot as many times as his right and moves through space in a balanced way left/right and backwards/forwards. Whether done individually or in a group (and so rhythmically), the football training ball SenseBall enables developing specific football skills, reacting quicker and gaining in rhythm.\n\nSENSEBALL PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS\n> Improved brain timing : the key to a healthier lifestyle and better learning\n> Perfect ambidextrous performance (two-footed player)\n> Better mastery and control of the ball thanks to repetition (myelin)\n> Greater precision in moving with and touches to the ball\n> Improved perception and coordination\n> Improved attention and concentration (rhythm influences cognitive aptitude)\n> Improved group work and learning (team building)\n> Develops autonomous, self-regulated learning\n> Increases sensitivity to acoustic signals (sonification, the sound of the touch of the ball)\n> Forms the correct body positions for football\n> Prevents the development of postural problems (fewer chronic injuries)\n> Trains players’ kinesthetic ability (millions of touches of the ball)\n> Retrieval models and structures help the brain to learn better and more quickly\n> Improvement of each gesture and movement by visualizing it better (have a clear image of the movement in the brain before putting it into practice)"

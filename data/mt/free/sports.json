LapSnap is the first mobile app to connect your AiM device directly to your phone, without extra equipment. Just connect, download and analyze.\n\n- Visualize the lines and analyze each lap to see why you’ve been fast or slow in a particular part of the track. You can analyze speed, acceleration or deceleration, gas and brakes application, RPMs, gear change, lean angel for motorcycles, temperatures for Go-Karts, as well as your line on the map.\n\n- Compare your laps with your best lap, ultimate lap or with someone else’s lap to see what you can do to become faster.\n\n- Easy access to each session and each lap. This way you can always refer back to a particular lap.\n\n- Leaderboard. See how you stack up against others racers. Each track has a leaderboard.\n\n- Save your setup. Every session can contain your vehicle settings like suspension setup, gear ratio, tires you use etc. This way when you're coming back to a track, you can refer to the settings you've used the last time and you're not wasting valuable track time finding a setting that works.\n\n- Ultimate Lap. Your laps are divided into sectors. By taking best sectors of different laps we can put together an Ultimate lap. This way you can see what you are capable of if you get every part of you lap just right.\n\nTerms of use: https://lapsnap.app/terms.html\n\nThis service is not affiliated with, endorsed by or in any way associated with AiM Tech Srl or GoPro Inc. or their products and services.

The test protocol was a consequence of match and time-motion analysis to support the logical validity of the FIET.\nThe FIET consists of shuttle-running bouts of 45 m (i.e., 3 × 15 m) performed at progressive speeds until exhaustion dictated by prerecorded audio cues.\nEvery 45-m, subjects are allowed to actively rest for 10 seconds.\nAfter each 8 × 45 m, bout players passively rest for 30 seconds before continuing. The starting speed is set at 9 km·h−1, and speed increments during the first 9 × 45-m bouts are of 0.33 km−1, successively shifting to 0.20 km·h−1 every 45 m until exhaustion."

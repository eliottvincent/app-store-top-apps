Once you have added all your players, why not update the color of your team shirts to match the colors they play in? You can have different colors for your outfield and goalkeeper shirts.\nAfter getting your team shirt colors sorted, head over to the tactics screen. \nHere you can start moving the players around to position them in the formation you want them to play. If you want absolute position perfection then tap on the player, scroll to the bottom and tap on the change coordinates row to start moving and positioning players via their x and y center coordinates in relation to the pitch. \nWith the players in the correct positions, we recommend saving the formation via the formation screen which can be accessed by tapping the icon next to the share icon in the top right.\nNow let’s set up our line up by tapping on one of the player shirts. This will present a screen to change the player. Tap the player who you want in that position and repeat this for all your starting line up!\nFor an extra nice touch add your team’s captain by tapping the c icon in the top left.\nWith everything now looking great, make sure you also include your subs by tapping on the sub icon next to the captain c icon in the top left.\n\nFinally, tap the share icon and let the world or even just your team, team mates, friends, nan and  lovely cat see your team with a beautiful image that can be shared via any social media or messaging apps.\n\nPlease then make sure to rate the app as it really does help out - unless you don’t like it :).\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or anything else then please reach out via the settings screen in the app.\n\nThis is a link to our terms of use - https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

It’s the personal basketball trainer that’s always with you, capturing your performance, your stats, and your progress—guiding you to the next level. With HomeCourt, every rep counts. \n\nTRAIN SMARTER\nHomeCourt captures your moves and your stats as you train—so you can see your true skill level. HomeCourt uses the camera on your device to track your performance in real-time, everything from your jump shot to your crossover. In-depth data and analytics help you break down every session. HomeCourt calculates metrics like shooting percentage, accuracy, release time, dribble speed, vertical jump and more. You can even use Apple Watch to track your heart rate and save your data to HealthKit. \n\nENGAGE IN FUN, INTERACTIVE DRILLS\nUsing HomeCourt is less like training and more like a video game. The immersive live-action experience is powered by AR (augmented reality), with virtual targets, audio cues, bonus levels, points and badges—it’s like you’re inside the game. Now practicing skills is engaging, not boring, so you’ll stick to it and improve more. \n\nLEARN FROM THE PROS\nHomeCourt is an official partner of the NBA and provides access to the expertise of the most elite players in the game today. Train with interactive drills and instruction from NBA and WNBA athletes. Learn their moves and even compete against them in interactive challenges. \n\nCOMPETE WITH FRIENDS\nDon’t workout alone, compete virtually with your friends, family, and teammates. You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad. No special basketballs, uncomfortable sensors, or expensive equipment is required. Just set up your phone with a clear view of the court and starting training and competing through HomeCourt.\n\nPRICING\n• Free: Access the full library of 100+ drills and activities. Get unlimited shot tracking.\n• HomeCourt Plus: Access your full workout history, get complete skill ratings, join the members-only training club, request feedback from HomeCourt pro trainers, participate in HomeCourt Global Camp, and create up to 4 user profiles.\n\nHomeCourt Plus is available for subscription as either monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions. Payment will be charged to your App Store account upon the expiration of the free trial period. Subscription automatically renews unless the subscription is canceled or auto-renew turned off at least 24 hours before the expiration of the free trial period or the current subscription period. Subscription may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to App Store account settings after purchase. Please visit https://www.homecourt.ai/legal/terms for the complete terms of use.\n\nGot any questions or feedback?\nPlease shoot us an email at support@homecourt.ai. We'd love to hear from you."

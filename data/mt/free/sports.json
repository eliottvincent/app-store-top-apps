Bu ücretsiz iddaa tahmin uygulamasının amacı çok yüksek oranlı olan bahisler vermektense her zaman kazandıran bahisler vermektir.\n\nSize sunulan banko iddaa tahminleri size sunulmadan evvel veri bilimini temel alan uzman görüşlerinden yararlanılmakta ve yapay zekanın kazandırma odaklı algoritma süzgecine sokulmaktadır. \n\nBu uygulamanın başarı oranı her gün yeni maç vermesinden ötürü değişmektedir; fakat uygulama içerisinde bulunan tahminler yapay zeka ve veri biliminden faydalanan uzman tahminciler tarafından sunulduğu için yüksek başarı oranı taşımaktadır.\n\nŞunu da net bir şekilde belirtmek gerekirse bu uygulama bir bahis tahmin uygulamasıdır ve %100 maç garantisi hiçbir zaman için vermeyecektir. Yani vermiş olduğumuz maçların hiçbirinin %100 garantisi bulunmamaktadır. Ayrıca size ücretsiz banko tahmin adı altında bunun %100 garantisini veren hiçbir kurum ve kişiye güvenmemenizi öneririz.\n\nTZ Tahmin, Banko İddaa Tahmin Uygulaması bir analiz sistemidir, içinde kesinlikle iddaa, bahis oynatılmamaktadır. Bu uygulamanın görevi yapay zeka ve veri biliminden faydalanan uzman tahmincilerin nasıl sonuçlanacağını tahmin ettiği maçları size ulaştırmak ve sizi en kazançlı hale getirmektir.\n\nUygulamayı indirdiğinizde öncelikle ilk yapmanız gereken şey uygulamaya üye olmaktır. Ardından yapay zeka tabanlı banko iddaa uygulamamız TZ Tahmin'in ana ekranında \"Dün Kazananlar, Ücretsiz Maçlar, Premium Maçlar, VIP Maçlar\" gibi çeşitli seçenekleri görebilirsiniz.\n\nBu seçeneklerin içerisinde bulunan tüm maçlar detaylı bir şekilde analiz edilmiş ve süzgeçten geçirilmiş maçlardır. Genel manada farkları ise şu şekildedir;\n\n-Ücretsiz maçların oranı en alt seviyededir ve daha genelgeçer bir analiz yapılmıştır.\n-Premium maçlarda verilen oran ücretsiz maçlara oranla bir tık daha yüksektir, analiz konusunda detaya inilmiştir.\n-VIP maçlarda verilen oran ise Premium maçlara oranla daha yüksektir ve en detaylı analiz bu seçenek içerisinde gerçekleştirilmektedir.\n\nTZ Tahmin Banko İddaa Tahmin Uygulaması Özellikleri\n-Yüksek başarı oranı bulunan banko iddaa maçları vermesi\n-Banko iddaa ve sürpriz iddaa tahmini\n-Ücretsiz maçlar\n-Premium maçlar\n-VIP maçlar\n-Ev sahibi, deplasman takımına yönelik özel bahis analizi\n-Karşılıklı gol var, karşılıklı gol yok parametrelerine özel iddaa tahminleri\n-Maçın alt veya üst bitmesine yönelik iddaa tahminleri\n\nSizden tek beklentimiz eğer beğendiyseniz iddaa konusunda ilgili olan arkadaşlarınıza tavsiye etmenizdir.\n\nKazandıran iddaa tahminleri TZ Tahmin'den ayrılmayın, hep beraber kazanmaya devam edelim!\n\n--------------------\n\nAbonelik Ücretleri ve Şartlar:\n\n₺8,49/hafta\n₺23,99/ay\n₺117,99/yıl\n\niTunes hesabı mevcut dönemin sona ermesine 24 saat kala abonelik yenileme için ücretlendirilecektir.

      "label": "The new iPING 2.0 putter app provides authorized PING club fitters and retailers a precise and easy-to-use a tool to ensure golfers experience a tour-level putter fitting from golf’s leader in custom fitting.\n\nThe patented technology measures and analyzes five key performance indicators in the putting stroke; 1) closing angle; 2) impact angle; 3) tempo; 4) lie angle and 5) shaft lean.  These stroke metrics, combined with detailed input from the golfer, are analyzed by a proprietary fitting algorithm which recommends the proper stroke type, length, loft, lie and weight for a PING putter.\n\n\nThe iPING 2.0 app offers four modes: \n\n1)   Guided Fit: Club fitting professionals recommend putter specifications by considering a variety of metrics; wrist-to-floor measurements, posture, gripping style, miss tendencies, green speed and speed performance in conjunction with hitting five (5) 10 ft. putts.  In this mode, putter comparisons can also be made and quantified.  \n\n2)   Single Putt: Club fitting professionals recommend putter specifications by capturing three (3) 10 ft. putts. Ideal for golf shop settings and quickly classifying a player’s Stroke Type. \n\n3)   Practice session:  Allows club fitting and teaching professionals to measure single-stroke metrics during a putting lesson.\n\n4)   Live Loft and Lie:  Allows club fitting and teaching professionals to measure loft and lie in real-time.\n\nAt this time, the iPING 2.0 app is intended for use by authorized PING retailers and club fitters only.  All technical support and availability of accessories will only be available to authorized PING club fitters and retailers."

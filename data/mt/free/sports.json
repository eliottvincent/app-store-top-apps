Our AI powered algorithms continuously analyze performance of soccer teams and help us figure out which results we can expect from upcoming soccer matches.\n\nIn our approach, we provide a probability for the likelihood of each of following bets to hold in each given match:\n\n- Home Wins (1)\n- Tie (X)\n- Away Wins (2)\n- Under 2.5 Goals (U2.5)\n- Over 2.5 Goals (O2.5)\n\nEach probability represents the level of confidence for each betting prediction. Higher the prediction confidence, more confident our AI models are on the shared prediction.\n\nApart from our sports betting predictions, we share reference odds from bookies for each bet so that you can evaluate our predictions by taking betting odds into consideration. Note that given reference odds may vary between bookmakers.\n\nFor today's football, you can use our past prediction accuracy stats, highlight the matches that suits your taste, and develop your betting strategy more wisely.\n\nOur soccer predictions are shared on a daily basis. Some predictions are shared for free while our VIP members get full access to all our sports betting predictions. In a busy week, we share predictions for up to 300 football matches and cover various football leagues from 20 countries as following: Australia (A-League), Austria (Tipp3 Bundesliga), Belgium (Jupiler Pro League), China (Super League), Denmark (Superligaen), England (Premier League, Championship, League One, League Two), France (Ligue 1, Ligue 2), Germany (Bundesliga 1, Bundesliga 2), Greece (Super League), Italy (Serie A, Serie B), Netherlands (Eredivisie), Norway (Eliteserien), Portugal (Primeira Liga), Russia (Super League), Scotland (Scottish Premiership), Spain (La Liga, La Liga 2), Sweden (Allsvenskan), Switzerland (Super League), Turkey (Super League), USA (MLS), Japan (J1 League), South Africa (Premier Division), Peru Uruguay, Colombia and Chile (Primera Division), Saudi Arabia (Pro League), Mexico (Liga MX), India (Indian Super League), Poland (Ekstraklasa), Croatia (Prva HNL), World Cup, Euro Championship and more.\n\nNo human interaction is involved when generating our predictions, and we solely rely on our own models that we have developed at Wise Prediction. Please note that predictions only represent the expected likelihood of each potential result by our models but sports competitions are always subject to end with unexpected results. No one can guarantee the result or statistics of a match with 100% accuracy before it is played. In case you bet on sports competitions based on our predictions, you do it at your own risk and we cannot be held responsible for your potential losses. You should never bet with amounts that you cannot afford losing. You are responsible for following rules and laws of your country."

      "label": "Boatie is an invaluable source of information for all who enjoy recreational boating in UK and Irish coastal waters.  Developed and used by a keen sailor, after 13 years it remains the popular choice and 'go-to' app of thousands.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• 'Port' display for over 700 primary and secondary ports from the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland.  This gives you a tide table for the next 7 days, along with a meteogram of 3 hourly weather forecasts and daylight times, position relative to closest springs or neaps and moon phase.  For 400 ports, there is a tidal curve prediction for the current day.  This is extendable to the full 7 days through an upgraded subscription.  With the curves you can see the height predicted for any time - or visa versa. \n\n• Tidal Streams for 7 days.  Pan and zoom the map to show your preferred area, and scroll along the time.  Touch and hold to see the forecasted set and drift.  This data covers the UK coastline except the north of Scotland, Outer Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetland Isles (i.e. roughly north of the Caledonian canal)\n\n• Weather: the current Inshore and Shipping forecasts, and synoptic charts for Northern Atlantic and NW Europe. \n\n• Navigation: displays your current GPS position, speed-over-ground, course-over-ground as well as distance and heading to user-configurable waypoints.  Waypoints can be imported or exported as GPX files and ordered within the file to allow quick switching to the next waypoint.  A built-in compass shows the direction to the current waypoint.\n\n• Reference: a useful set of information easily to hand whether you're out on the water or doing your theory course. It currently includes:\n - Day shapes\n - Navigation lights\n - Sound signals\n - Beaufort scale\n - Forecast terminology\n - Inshore forecast areas map\n - Signal flags, phonetic alphabet & morse code\n - VHF Channel usage plus emergency radio protocols\n - IALA A Buoyage\n\nAn internet connection is required for some features, although the data is then cached for short periods for use whilst out sailing.  In practice, for weather you should aim to have a connection twice a day - and for tides every other day.\n\nSo, next time you are meeting the crew in the pub for planning your weekend, or when you're out enjoying it, take Boatie to have the key information you need with you on your iPhone.\n\nPlease do let me know your feedback - I'm always very grateful for the positive reviews entered in the app store - it's a great way of showing your appreciation and helps reassure others about to purchase.  However, if you have questions, find problems or have suggestions for future improvements please use the facilities in the app to contact me\n\nBoatie - Terms & Conditions: https://msswsolutions.com/boatie-terms-and-conditions/\nApple EULA: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "The APP of Dolomiti Superski is supposed to be a real online ski guide for those who want to discover the world’s largest ski carousel and is supported by all the operating systems of the most common smart phones. It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

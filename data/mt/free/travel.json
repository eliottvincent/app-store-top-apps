      "label": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\n\nTaxify your life with the Yango taxi app. It puts the whole city in your hands and lets you ride wherever you want to go via taxi. Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango. These scooters are bright yellow (not lime green), so you can't miss them! Easily order a scooter, find locations on the map (they look like a dot), and build routes with the same high-quality scooters you know and love, all in one convenient, top-tier app. We offer free unlocks and 20 NIS discounts on the first 3 rides to everyone who loves the feel of the wind in their hair. Just log into Yango, select scooters, and enjoy your three free unlocks!\n\nMeet Delivery in Israel - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier all around the Gush Dan district. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car.\n\nEnjoy your ride!\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the Yango taxi app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at yango.com/en_gh/support/\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties. \nUp to 50% (max 6 GHC/5 GHC) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Accra/Kumasi until 31.12.2022.\nThe 30% (max 10 EUR) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Helsinki until 31.12.2022. The 30% (max 100 kr) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Oslo until 31.12.2022.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions"

Når din taxa er på vej, kan du følge den på skærmen, og hvis nødvendigt kontakte din chauffør inden ankomst. \n\nIngen overraskelser på taxa-prisen\nHvis du foretrækker at kende prisen på forhånd, kan du trygt bestille med Dantaxi. Med vores mulighed for faste priser, kan du bare slappe af og nyde turen – og hvis du foretrækker taxameter, er det selvfølgelig også en mulighed. Uanset hvad du vælger, er betalingen gjort nemt for dig, ved muligheden for at afregne direkte i appen eller på den kendte metode, med kort/kontanter i vognen, når turen er slut.\n\nEl-taxaer\nDu kan prioritere miljøet, og vælge el-taxa som dit foretrukne køretøj. Vi har en af Danmarks største flåder af el-taxaer, og der kommer nye til hver uge. Vores el-taxaer er derfor tilgængelige i stadig flere byer og områder. Ved et enkelt valg gør du din taxatur mere grøn.\n \nSikkerhed frem for alt \nDin sikkerhed er vigtigst for os. Vi giver dig adgang til de bedste chauffører i branchen og alle vores taxaer er godkendte til individuel persontransport. Alle vores chauffører er i besiddelse af chaufførkort udstedt af Færdselsstyrelsen i Danmark. Du har altid adgang til dine tidligere bestillinger, og du modtager kvittering på mail efter hver tur. Du har mulighed for at bedømme/rate turen og på den måde give os feedback til at gøre oplevelse eller appen endnu bedre. \n\nFlere fordele med Eurobonus, Ældre Sagen, Studiz eller Pluskort\nDantaxi samarbejder bl.a. med Eurobonus, Ældre Sagen, Studiz og Pluskortet. Herigennem får du adgang til endnu flere fordele, direkte integreret i appen.     \n\nErhvervsaftaler\nHar dit firma en Business Priority aftale med Dantaxi? Så kan du få alle dine fordele tilføjet – hurtigt og nemt.

      "label": "Buy one of our prepaid eSIM plans at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) in over 190+ countries and regions to enjoy global connectivity!\nAdd a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and stop worrying about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

Always!\n\nBut in more practical terms:\n• To be part of a community trying to be more sustainable through less owning products and more sharing.\n• When you realize the cost associated with owning your own bike or leasing from a regular bike-lease company.\n• When you have a flat tire or broken lights. Don’t wait for repairs, hop on to a nearby Donkey bike with our app.\n• When you’re visiting other towns, simply open the app and see if we are there.\n• When guests visit you, share your love for biking with them.\n\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I rent more than one bike at once?\nYes, you can rent up to 5 bikes at once! Just make sure to select the correct number of vehicles right at the beginning of your booking process.\n\nCan I leave the bike anywhere?\nNo. We work hard with the cities to keep the streets clean and accessible for everyone. Please return your Donkeys to specific drop-off locations when you are done for the day.\n\nWhat if I have issues?\nOur support team is always happy to help and understands that life happens.\n\n\nHOW PRICING WORKS\n\nJust Ride (Pay as you go)\nWith no strings attached. Just Ride is ideal for trips from 15 mins to a few hours. You can also top up your Donkey Wallet with money and we will give you bonus credit that you can use for Just Riding.\n\nDay Deals\nIn some cities, we have rolled out day deals which are great for when you just need a bike for the 1,2,3, or up to 7 days. Visiting for a weekend or inspired to explore like a local when you're on vacation? This is the perfect solution for you or a guest visiting you. \n\nMonthly memberships\nWith a Donkey membership, you pay a fixed monthly fee and get a certain amount of free time per day. If you exceed the included daily free time, your rental is extended for a low fixed cost. Ideal for the daily commute and for a busy city life with multiple errands throughout the day. Valid in all Donkey cities.\n\n\nCYCLING IS OUR PASSION\n\nWe are a team of 40(ish) firm believers in cycling as the most efficient mode of transportation and the only one our cities need. We work by the rule that any decision we make will have to bring us closer to being a sustainable, affordable, and reliable mobility provider. We wish to show the world that cycling can make cities more liveable and bike-sharing will help in that transformation.\n\nDonkey Republic - Every ride counts"

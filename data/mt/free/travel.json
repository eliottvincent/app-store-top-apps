Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others.

Add a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and never worry about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM-compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM for whatever local carriers exist in the country you’re currently in, but without this old-school plastic SIM card you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIM is a true technological revolution and we bring it right into your eSIM compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or pay for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your own phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store for your convenience. Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find an updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link: https://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to get connected during their travels - it doesn't matter whether you're a seafarer, flight crew, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries -  We are here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more enormous roaming data fees\n* Installation in 2 minutes or less\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your number as you travel\n* No more fumbling to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky Wi-Fi dongle around\n\nHow does it work?\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM You can install your eSIM directly or by scanning a QR code or manually inserting an activation code provided. You can also manage and top-up your eSIMs with your Airalo account.\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fragile, tiny hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things easier for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees. \n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device.

      "label": "Wanderlog is a free travel app for planning every kind of trip, including road trips and group travel: create a trip itinerary, budget costs, organize flight and hotel reservations, view places to visit on a map, and collaborate with friends. After your trip, share a travel guide to inspire other travelers.\n\n- See flights, hotels, and attractions in one place (like TripIt and Tripcase)\n- View plans on a travel map & map your route (like Roadtrippers)\n- Rearrange the order of places easily by drag-and-drop\n- Planning a road trip? Add unlimited stops for free, optimize your route, view times & distances between places, and export places to Google Maps\n- Planning group travel? Invite friends and collaborate in real-time just (like Google Docs)\n- Automatically import reservations by forwarding emails or connecting your Gmail\n- Add things to do from top guides with 1 click (like Tripadvisor and Google Trips/Google Travel)\n- Access your trip plans offline\n- Add notes and links to your stops\n- Have your trip plans automatically sync across devices\n- Set budget, track expenses, and split bills with a group\n\n-------\n\nSEE IT ON A MAP\n\nEvery time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.\n\nSTORE PLANS OFFLINE\n\nAll your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.\n\nGET ON THE ROAD\n\nLooking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.\n\nCOLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS\n\nFor group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.\n\nSTAY ORGANIZED\n\nAccess flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.\n\nGET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION\n\nFor each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.\n\nCONTROL YOUR SPENDING\n\nSet a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates."

      "label": "The MVV-App is a journey planning application created by the Munich transport association (Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund, MVV). It is both free of charge and without advertising.\n\nIt provides travel information for the entire public transport network in Munich and the surrounding regions (districts of Dachau, Ebersberg, Erding, Freising, Fürstenfeldbruck, München, Starnberg and the norhern part of Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen) – no matter whether you go by train, (sub)urban railways, underground, tram or bus. In many cases with real-time information. With the MVV-App you can also purchase selected MVV tickets with your smartphone or tablet on the go. Register once and you have the option to either buy the single trip tickets or you can choose to buy one of our day tickets for your stay in Munich. Besides, the MVV-App provides additional information on public transport in the entire Greater Munich Area, such as public transport and tariff maps as well as any changes in the timetables.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Departures:\nThe departure monitor indicates the next departures and/or arrivals from a stop or the stops in the neighborhood of your current location in real-time (where available).\n\n• Trips:\nThe journey planner will help you to find the quickest route from A to B – in many cases with real-time information. Just enter the name of a stop, a point of interest or any desired address in Munich or the surrounding districts as your starting point or destination. With GPS you can also use your current location. The results include all footpath directions. Save and label your favorite trips, get further information about your journey, share your trips or enter them into your calendar to be notified in time. The MVV-App also helps you buy the correct ticket for the selected journey. With just a few clicks you can purchase mobile tickets directly from the journey planner.\n\n• Disruptions:\nAt a glance, you can see disruptions that might affect your daily commute ordered by lines and their operation names. As yet, the descriptions of timetable changes are only available in German.\n\n• Tickets:\nWith menu item “Tickets” you can purchase selected MVV tickets as mobile ticket. Register once within one of the listed shops (identical range of tickets) and choose your ticket before starting your journey. You can pay for your tickets by using a credit card or direct debit. As electronic tickets are personalized, you have to bring your official photo ID.\n\n• Network plans:\nIn addition, the MVV-App provides you with various public transport network plans and tariff maps. Although most of the plans are in German language, you can find several plans in English, too. For example: the general plan of the regional train, suburban train and underground in the entire MVV area.\n\n• Interactive map:\nThe interactive map does not just help you to come along in the MVV area. You get access to further information such as nearby departures by using your GPS signal.\n\n• Settings:\nIf you choose the appropriate settings, you can for example avoid stairs during your trip or prefer less walking time over the quickest connection. In case you take a bike with you, the journey planner is able to take this into account too. You can also exclude connections not being integrated within the MVV tariff."

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24.

      "label": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\n\nTaxify your life with the Yango taxi app. It puts the whole city in your hands and lets you ride wherever you want to go via taxi. Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango. These scooters are bright yellow (not lime green), so you can't miss them! Easily order a scooter, find locations on the map (they look like a dot), and build routes with the same high-quality scooters you know and love, all in one convenient, top-tier app. We offer free unlocks and 20 NIS discounts on the first 3 rides to everyone who loves the feel of the wind in their hair. Just log into Yango, select scooters, and enjoy your three free unlocks!\n\nMeet Delivery in Israel - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier all around the Gush Dan district. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car.\n\nEnjoy your ride!\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the Yango taxi app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at yango.com/en_gh/support/\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties. \nUp to 50% (max 6 GHC/5 GHC) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Accra/Kumasi until 31.12.2022.\nThe 30% (max 10 EUR) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Helsinki until 31.12.2022. The 30% (max 100 kr) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Oslo until 31.12.2022.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions"

      "label": "Buy one of our prepaid eSIM plans at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) in over 190+ countries and regions to enjoy global connectivity!\nAdd a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and stop worrying about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

Conocé gente y pasala mejor en tus viajes... además podés cuidar tu bolsillo y el medio ambiente :D\nEn pocos segundos, ya seas conductor o pasajero, cargá y/o buscá un viaje y de forma gratuita. Es un proyecto de gestión colaborativa y sin fines de lucro de la asociación civil STS Rosario.\n\nCarpoolear te ofrece distintos niveles de privacidad a la hora de publicar tu viaje ((“sólo para amigos”, “hasta amigos de amigos” y “para todos los carpooleros”). Además, podés ver las calificaciones y el perfil de facebook de otros usuarios. Calificá al resto de los carpooleros con los que hayas compartido un viaje, y anda armando tu red de amistad carpoolera\n\nCarpoolear es un proyecto de economía colaborativa, nos damos una mano entre todos. Los gastos de viaje (combustible y peaje) se dividen en partes iguales entre los viajeros (conductor y pasajeros). ¡Claro que el conductor puede pedir una contribución menor o ninguna! Algunos sólo piden que el copiloto no se duerma nunca o que lleven torta para compartir :D … es cuestión de ponerse de acuerdo antes de viajar.\n\nCarpoolear te ayuda a colaborar con el medio ambiente.  Cuando dos conductores viajan en sólo un auto, quedando el otro guardado, se genera un impacto positivo sobre el medio ambiente\nMenos autos circulando implica reducir: emisión de gases de efecto invernadero, consumo de combustibles fósiles, embotellamientos, contaminación.\nCarpoolear es un proyecto de gestión colaborativa y sin fines de lucro de la asociación civil STS Rosario www.stsrosario.org.ar . El código de la plataforma es abierto, podés revisar y colaborar con el desarrollo de la programación en https://github.com/STS-Rosario También podés sumarte en alguna de las tres áreas del proyecto: comunicación, sistemas y fundraising. Conocé más acerca de este proyecto en ruta desde el año 2013 y sobre cómo podés colaborar para que este auto llegue más lejos en www.carpoolear.com.ar :D"

      "label": "Fight Jet Lag is a product created to help people cope with jet lag and get back to normal sleep routine. The mobile app is designed to beat extreme tiredness and minimize other negative side effects felt by a person after a long flight across multiple time zones.\n\nEven though jet lag can’t kill you, it can significantly reduce your vacation or business travel comfort. Jet lag can cause gastrointestinal health problems, general malaise, headaches, insomnia, irritability, daytime sleepiness, disorientation which altogether lead to reduced physical and mental performance.\n\nFight Jet Lag offers a solution to the jet lag problem by creating a personalized recovery plan for each traveller based on their sleep routine. Here is how the app works:\n\n- A user enters when and where they depart and arrive.\n- Then, they specify how many days they have to adapt, whether they have to get up at some specific time the following day to attend a meeting, for example, or if they are free and can relax.\n- After that, users specify their normal sleep schedule and when they'd like to get up in the new place.\n- Using all the data, the app calculates the best sleep schedule with a smooth transition from one time zone to another.\n- The app automatically sets up a number of morning alarms and schedules notifications to remind users when they should go to bed.\n- The calendar displays the generated schedule, if necessary users can make changes to it.\n- In the end, the app offers users a set of useful tips that help prevent jet lag or reduce its harmful side effects."

      "label": "New: Gowwiz in freemium version allows you to test for free the first days of the program.\nIn this version, you can, in addition to managing your jet lag (the main function), be accompanied to resynchronize the taking of medication during your long-haul trips.\nIndeed, Gowwiz will not only allow you to quickly reduce the impact of jet lag, but will also help you optimize the best time for taking your medication.\nYou also have access to a music playlist developed especially for long trips!\nGowwiz accompanies you and allows you to have visibility on the duration of your jet lag: 1 day, 2 days, more?\nFinally, reassured, supported, accompanied!\nWith Gowwiz, the result is 100% guaranteed! You will recover quickly and naturally. It's physiological, it's chronobiological.\n\nDeveloped in partnership with the CHRU and the Sleep Center of Brest (France), Gowwiz is the application that reduces the impact of jet lag on the traveler.\nBased on chronobiology, the science of the body's biological rhythms, this personalized program with a high degree of technicality will provide you the keys to get back on schedule quickly.\nJust enter your usual sleep information: bedtime, wake-up time, sleeping quality; enter your travel dates and hours and based on the jet lag, Gowwiz will generate a customized program of actions to insert into your day: optimal moments for light exposition, nap, meal, sleep..., easily and naturally, your body will resynchronize itself on the destination.\nGowwiz algorithms are the result of more than a year of research in partnership with the team of the sleep center of the CHRU of Brest.\nAn advice: follow the program as well as possible and you will be able to recover up to 4 hours of jet lag per day! So enjoy your trip!\n\nWhat is jet lag?\nBy travelling rapidly through more than 3 time zones, your body has not had time to adapt to its new destination. This is called the desynchronization effect. Your body thinks it's the morning, whereas it's time to go to bed! In short, these are difficult moments that can persist for several days and ruin the beginning of a stay.\n\nChronobiology :\nDid you know that? Our body, as a whole, is subject to an endogenous cycle of about 24 hours. This is the circadian cycle.  The main synchronizer of our internal clocks is light: thanks to it, our body gives us the signal to sleep and gives rhythm to our day. Light is the main synchronizer but there are other secondary synchronizers such as: food, temperature, physical exercise....\n\nThe solution:\nAnd so it is, quite naturally by relying on these synchronizers that the Gowwiz program will shift your body's circadian cycle so that it is in line with your destination.\nBut be careful, each person has his/her own cycle and that is why Gowwiz offers a personalized program.\nAnd above all, don't be discouraged, don't give up. Just because you miss a day or an action doesn't mean you should give up. It's like a diet, a gap, an oversight, it doesn't matter!\nIf you are looking for Gowiz, Gowwiz, Goowiz, Gowwizz, Gowwizz, it's also here!\nYou want more information, know our news and be notified of promotions: it's here: https://www.gowwiz.com/\nDo you want to offer Gowwiz to your customers?

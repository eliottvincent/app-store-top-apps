Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

      "label": "Just buy one of our eSIM travel mobile data packs at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) for over 190+ countries and regions globally to enjoy global connectivity. Add a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and never worry about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM-compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM for whatever local carriers exist in the country you’re currently in, but without this old-school plastic SIM card you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIM is a true technological revolution and we bring it right into your eSIM compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or pay for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your own phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store for your convenience. Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find an updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link: https://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to get connected during their travels - it doesn't matter whether you're a seafarer, flight crew, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries -  We are here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more enormous roaming data fees\n* Installation in 2 minutes or less\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your number as you travel\n* No more fumbling to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky Wi-Fi dongle around\n\nHow does it work?\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM You can install your eSIM directly or by scanning a QR code or manually inserting an activation code provided. You can also manage and top-up your eSIMs with your Airalo account.\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fragile, tiny hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things easier for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees. \n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

Save hundreds of dollars compared to other travel sites.\n\nDiscover extraordinary travel deals, set fare alerts, and uncover great hotel rates.\n\nWe’re so good, United Airlines actually sued us for it!\n\n• Find flights other search engines won’t show you -- including HIDDEN-CITY flights and arbitrary round-trips\n• Filter flights by duration, number of layovers, takeoff/landing time and more\n• Our powerful search engine pulls in the best deals to save you from having to google flights and check multiple sites\n• Monitor prices for trips you have in the hopper and let us alert you when the best deal is available\n• Book hotels as well, including last-minute hotels and special deals\n• Filter hotels, read reviews and view traveler ratings\n• We now offer car rental as well, so you can use one app as your complete trip planner\n• Our new Stories feature lets you book activities for your vacation - take a brewery tour, rent a kayak, or buy tickets in advance and get your guide to museums and exhibits\n\nThe fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

The MuniMobile app lets you purchase and use fares and passes instantly on your phone—anywhere, anytime. Just download the free app, create an account and you're ready to go.\n \nWHY YOU'LL LOVE THIS APP:\n• No paper fares to keep track of.\n• No need to carry cash, count exact change, or find a ticket machine.\n• Buy and use fares using a debit/credit card, PayPal or Apple Pay\n• Store multiple tickets on your phone for future use. \n• Pay a single fare or multiple fares for a group of riders.\n• Register your debit/credit card(s) in our secure system.\n \nHOW IT WORKS:\n1. CHOOSE RIDER TYPE: Adult, Senior/Disabled/Medicare, Youth, or SF Access\n2. CHOOSE FARE: Single Trip Fare for Muni Bus & Rail, Single Ride Fare for Cable Car, or Passports\n3. CHOOSE QUANTITY: You can buy multiple tickets to use later\n4. CHECK OUT: Pay with debit/credit card, PayPal or Apple Pay\n \nCOMMON QUESTIONS:\nQ: Do I need to be connected to the Internet?\nA cellular network or a wireless Internet connection is required to purchase tickets, but you can use/activate your tickets offline. \n\nQ: What if my battery dies?\nJust like with paper tickets, you're responsible for making sure you have a valid fare at all times, so be sure to plan ahead!\n\nIMPORTANT REMINDERS:\n • Don't uninstall the MuniMobile app or erase your phone without transferring your unused tickets first. Your tickets are stored on your phone (which makes it possible to use them without a cellular network or a wireless Internet connection). Activate your ticket before boarding.\n• In the subway, activate (“use”) your purchased mobile ticket before passing through metro station fare gates. Show your active ticket to the station agent, and pass through the fare gate closest to the station agent booth. If the station agent is not present, you may still pass through the gate as long as your ticket has been activated.  Do not attempt to “tag” the gate.\n• On the surface, use your purchased mobile ticket before boarding the vehicle. You may board through any door. If you feel more comfortable boarding through the front door to show your ticket to the transit operator, please feel free to do so.\n• For Cable Car, use your purchased mobile ticket once you are on board the vehicle. Show your mobile ticket to the Cable Car conductor.\n• Watch your battery level! Just like with paper tickets, you're responsible for making sure you have a valid fare at all times.\n• Create an account before purchasing tickets, as this is the only way you can transfer your unused tickets if you get a new phone. (Note: Only unused tickets can be transferred. Use up any activated tickets before switching phones.)"

I go through all the comments, one by one, so that you can get better flight deals. \n\nWhat you can do with my app:\n\n•        Get cheap flight tickets\n•        Plan your trip ahead\no        Choose your seat\no        Order your meal beforehand\no        Buy additional luggage\no        Book your hotel room\no        Rent a car\no        Buy Fast Track\n•        Gift flight tickets with Gift Card\n•        Become a member of BolBol, my loyalty program\n•        Collect BolPoints, my flight points \n\nNo doubt that these are not the only things you can do with the app of “The Digital Airlines of Turkey.” You can find out more when you download my app.... Hearing about me is not enough, you have to experience me, dear!\n\nFAQ \n\nLet's go through the questions you are dying to know about me, flights bookings, cheap flights, flight deals, and much more…\n\nHow can I auto-fill my passenger information?\n\nYou'll need a BolBol account first. If you're not a member yet, you can easily sign up. You have to be signed in to your BolBol account to auto-fill your information.  \n\nIf you want to buy a flight ticket for another person, you need to go to User Settings and create a new profile for that person through \"\"My Contacts\"\" tab. Fill out the information for once and then save. This way you can buy flight tickets faster next time! \n\nHow can I save my credit card information?\n\nGo to your User Settings and find Saved Cards tab. Here you can safely manage, save, change or delete any of your cards. By saving credit card information, you won't need to fill out your card information and choose one of your saved cards faster when you are buying your next ticket. All of your information is protected in our secure database. \n\nAlso, you can save your card information at the Checkout screen and use the saved information to buy your next cheap flight ticket.\n\nAfter the last update, the app doesn't open or respond. What should I do?\n\nUnfortunately, I have to update my app to make it better and fix known issues. My app will be guiding you through the update processes so that you can use the most recent version.\n\nBonus \n\nHow can I get the cheapest flight tickets?\n\nFirst, you can download my app to help me alert you for flight deals of Pegasus Airlines.\n\nAt flight finder screen you can filter tickets by price, so you can choose the most suitable flight for yourself. \n\nAlso, you can plan your trip in advance and find the cheapest flight tickets on my app.\n\n***\n\nThat's all for now!

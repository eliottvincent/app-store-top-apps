Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango.

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

      "label": "Buy one of our prepaid eSIM plans at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) in over 190+ countries and regions to enjoy global connectivity!\nAdd a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and stop worrying about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

      "label": "Wanderlog is a free travel app for planning every kind of trip, including road trips and group travel: create a trip itinerary, budget costs, organize flight and hotel reservations, view places to visit on a map, and collaborate with friends. After your trip, share a travel guide to inspire other travelers.\n\n- See flights, hotels, and attractions in one place (like TripIt and Tripcase)\n- View plans on a travel map & map your route (like Roadtrippers)\n- Rearrange the order of places easily by drag-and-drop\n- Planning a road trip? Add unlimited stops for free, optimize your route, view times & distances between places, and export places to Google Maps\n- Planning group travel? Invite friends and collaborate in real-time just (like Google Docs)\n- Automatically import reservations by forwarding emails or connecting your Gmail\n- Add things to do from top guides with 1 click (like Tripadvisor and Google Trips/Google Travel)\n- Access your trip plans offline\n- Add notes and links to your stops\n- Have your trip plans automatically sync across devices\n- Set budget, track expenses, and split bills with a group\n\n-------\n\nSEE IT ON A MAP\n\nEvery time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.\n\nSTORE PLANS OFFLINE\n\nAll your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.\n\nGET ON THE ROAD\n\nLooking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.\n\nCOLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS\n\nFor group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.\n\nSTAY ORGANIZED\n\nAccess flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.\n\nGET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION\n\nFor each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.\n\nCONTROL YOUR SPENDING\n\nSet a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates."

The map shows both domestic and international flights.\n- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.\n- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.\n- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).\n- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.\n- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.\n\nBy the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:\n\n- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.\n- Guided and self-guided tours.\n- Cars and transfers to get from the airport to the hotel.

      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 700 cities in 47 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

This is due to prevent the device from dying and the alarm not going off.\n\n• Keep your Apple Music available on your device\nThe music you can select consists of everything you have available on your ‘Apple Music’ app on your device. If the music is saved on your iCloud, and not on the device itself, it won’t be available.\n\n\nNEVER MISS AN ALARM\nWhen you closed the app and not having it running in the background? The alarm will use the device volume instead and play the notification sound system.\n\nThe app will close itself automatically after 10 hours of inactivity. This is due to prevent the device from dying and the alarm not going off.\n\nWhen your device is muted, set to ‘Do Not Disturb’ or your device volume is set to 0, the alarm won’t play properly. It will still show the notification without any sound. This is due to Apple’s restrictions as we are unable to access the app settings when the app is closed, only when it’s open or running in the background.\n\n\n>> Have any questions?\nPlease check out if the answers are available in the Frequently Asked Questions in the app Settings.\nHave suggestions or unable to find the answers to your questions?

I noticed that some had Venmo, others had CashApp, and some people had PayPal and Zelle combined. It came to my realization that some people had a strong preference for the payment app that they preferred. After all, we live in 2022 and no one ever carries cash on them.\n\nThe whole process of asking for usernames and then figuring out the right app to open on your phone, and then making sure that the right username has been entered seemed clunky and needed to be improved. As a software engineer and an entrepreneur at heart, I went straight to work to build a unified platform that makes it easy to add all your payment profiles into one place.\n\nThe goal here is to switch the question from \"what payment app do you have?\". to \"Send me your paylinkz url\" and to remove the friction from sending and receiving money.\n\nI hope you find a lot of value in it."

      "label": "Euro Coins Album is a great and genial application which allows you to have your private Euro coins collection always with you.\nWith the \"Commemoratives\" section you can see, select and archive every single commemorative coin issued from 2004 to now.\nIn the \"Divisional\" section you can archive by Country and by Year your entire divisional euro coin collection.\n\nWhen you select a coin, commemorative or divisional, you can read its description, its effigy, its coinage and more other like its specs (weight, diameter,thickness, material)*.\n\nYou can choose through six different conditions of the coins before archive it, so you will have the possibility of adding every single coin you own with its quantities and its conditions.\n\nHere's a list of the six conditions included in Euro Coins Album:\n-BU: for uncirculated coins\n-BE: for PROOF coins\n-Circulated: for circulated coins and collected \n-Coincard: for coins within their Coincard \n-Official: for coins in their official package\n-N/P envelope\n\nYou can also see the mintage of a coin in details with its official packages it comes with. \n\nEuro Coins Album provides the possibility of archiving each coin by its mint mark, for example:\n-A/D/F/G/J for German coins\n-E/F/S for Greek coins in 2002\nAnd others...\n\nWith the last update there is now a quick view of collected coins sorted by condition in each page (commemoratives, divisionals)\n\nIn the \"Collection's Details\" section it's shown a complete summary of your collection. Here you can see the quantity of coins owned by its category (1 Cent-2 Euro) and in total too, so you will know the effective value of your collection.\n\nYou can search through your coins with the \"Find\" function making everything faster.\nWith OTA updates you will receive updates directly to the app having new released coins almost instantly.\n\nCustomise the graphic as you prefer simply going in the Settings section.\nEuro Coins Album is the best solution for each numismatic coin collector who always wants to know which coins he owns and which he is missing.\n\nEuro Coins Album supports now the Dropbox integration for backing up your collection.  \n\n*specifics of the coin as the title and the description of the coins are written in Italian.  \nTranslations will come in the next updates.\n\nOFICIAL MINT ISSUES SUBSCRIPTION:\nWith the update 7.5 of the app, it now allows you to collect every folder/box/official package distributed from the mints. Through this, the app will automatically keep trace of the coins they contain and will mark them as owned.\nThis mode is not obligatory and is designed for who uses to collect folders in addition to circulated coins or coins from rolls.\n\n• The duration of the subscription is 1 month, 6 months or 1 year, depending what plan is chosen.\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n• Privacy policy: www.eurocoinsalbum.com\n• Terms of use: www.eurocoinsalbum.com/privacy"

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

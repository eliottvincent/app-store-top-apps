      "label": "Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online. We know that every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we designed tools like Family Link that give you the flexibility to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. Family Link’s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.\n\n\nWith Family Link, you can:\n\nEstablish Digital Ground Rules\n• Set screen time limits — Family Link lets you set downtime for your child’s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.\n• Guide them to age-appropriate content — Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.\n\nManage and secure your child’s account \n• Protect their privacy — Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child’s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child’s device. \n• Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.\n\nStay connected on the go\n• See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.\n• Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location.  You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.\n\n\nImportant Information\n\n• Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/\n• While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.\n• You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.\n• To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.\n• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.\n• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family."

The app allows you to choose a custom phone number and make phone calls without displaying your real number.\nThere is no need to buy an additional SIM card and swap it when you want to call from another number. Now you can make calls from different numbers quickly, easily and free of charge!\n \nKeep your international number as long as you like and add more minutes and SMS to your 2Number’s balance. Make international calls and text from another number at the cheapest rates. Use in-app currency to make calls worldwide! For example, you’ll need only 2 credits per minute to make a call to Mexico.\n \nWith 2Number, you can get additional numbers and use them instead of your actual phone number for various situations like:\n• Buying or selling things on local e-commerce platforms. Use a temporary number to post your ads and receive calls and delete it after the deal is done! \n• Dating. Giving out an alternative number to your new acquaintance from one of those dating apps can be a good idea. Just in case ;)\n• Business needs (e.g., as a second work number).

      "label": "Get the people-first browser that’s backed by a non-profit. \n\nIt’s a new era in tech. Don’t settle for a browser produced by giant, profit-driven, data-hoarding tech companies. Firefox is the obvious choice for independent, ethical tech that respects your privacy and gives you more ways than ever to tailor your internet experience exactly the way you want it. Download Firefox now for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nFirefox is backed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. When you make Firefox your go-to, everyday browser, you’re also joining a unique (serious nerd cred) community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  \n\nFirefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. \nWe want you to have an amazing experience every time you use Firefox. We know feeling safe and secure are foundational for enjoying your time online. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.\n\nDIFFERENT DEVICES.  SAME TRAIN OF THOUGHT\nNow you can search for things on your laptop, then pick up the exact same search on your phone and vice versa. Your Firefox homepage displays the most recent searches you’ve done on other devices so you can easily get back to what you were doing or thinking about. \n\nLIMITED-EDITION WALLPAPERS\nIntroducing limited-edition wallpapers from independent creators. Stick with one you love or switch it up anytime to make Firefox match your mood. \n\n\nSTREAMLINED HOME SCREEN\nPick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.\n\nPRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES\nFirefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to strict blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.\n\nGET FIREFOX ON  ALL YOUR DEVICES\nAdd Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. In addition to synced tabs and searches, Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.\n\nFIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR\nGet search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.\n\nORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE\nCreate as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails and numbered tabs, making it easy to find what you want quickly.\n\nSHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS\nThe Firefox web browser makes it easy to share links to web pages or specific items on a page with easy, quick access to your most recently used apps.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT FIREFOX WEB BROWSER:\n- Read about Firefox permissions: http://mzl.la/Permissions\n- Learn more about what’s up at Mozilla: https://blog.mozilla.org\n\nABOUT MOZILLA\nMozilla exists to build the Internet as a public resource accessible to all because we believe open and free is better than closed and controlled. We build products like Firefox to promote choice and transparency and give people more control over their lives online.

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "TOR Browser: Private Onion VPN is an advanced engineered browser technology designed to route your web traffic via a secure TOR and VPN network. It works by encrypting and then rerouting your data via three random nodes (servers) to protect your data and throw off-trail any hacker or cyber-criminal tracing you.\n\nOnion VPN Browser is a free dark web browser app that is designed to bring the infamous web version of TOR Network to your smartphone. It is designed to channel your web traffic via the secure and anonymous TOR Network and VPN so as to ensure that your personal identity stays intact.\n\nIf you want to add more protection to the Onion VPN Browser, you can make use of the maximum security brought by the global VPN servers that create a shield between your personal data and the cybercriminals. By using the advanced AES-256 encryption protocol, you can rest assured that no cyber criminal will be able to trace, track, or steal your data.\n\nYou can choose from a list of international VPN servers that offer unlimited bandwidth so you can not only mask your IP address and protect your personal data but also stream the web.\nFeatures:\nTOR Nodes to Encrypt Your Data\nCombine TOR with VPN for maximum security\nInternational VPN Servers with Unlimited Bandwidth\nAuto Remove Browsing History\nSave Thousands of Bookmarks\nAccess Dark Web Anonymously\nAccess Deep Web Privately\nSafely Access Crypto Websites\nDownload Unlimited Songs, Books, and Documents\nCustomize TOR Browser Settings\nBlock Ads\nPrevent Tracking\nConnect at a Tap\n\nNEVER COMPROMISE YOUR IDENTITY: Whether you are a journalist, social activist, or internet freedom lover, you will agree that preserving your identity is the most important thing when browsing the internet. 99% of the websites are designed to store your IP address and steal your personal data. \n\nANONYMOUS SHOPPING: There have been many incidents of “Man-in-Middle attacks” in recent years where a hacker would redirect you to a seemingly verified shopping website and then steal your credit card information thus robbing you of hundreds or even thousands of dollars. VPN with TOR Browser protects you against such websites. Even when you are shopping, with Darknet, your sensitive information, identity, and credit card information is protected.\n\nEXCLUSIVE STREAMING: The TOR VPN uses the latest proxy to enable you to access exclusive streaming sites without having to worry about losing your identity or personal data. You can download movies, songs, rare books, and almost anything else via the Darknet which is normally inaccessible using the regular mainstream browsers.\n\nTHREE TIMES THE NORMAL SECURITY: Most of the mainstream browsers offer just one layer of security only when you connect to an external VPN. Private TOR Browser, on the other hand, offers five layers of security. Three Layers of security come from the special TOR Browser Nodes.\n\n\nYou can also upgrade to our premium plan to enjoy a lot more features. Some of the features are highlighted here:\nZero Ads\nUnlimited Global VPN Servers\nFaster VPN Connection Speed\nSave Unlimited Bookmarks\nAccess Dark Web & Deep Web with faster TOR Nodes\nAuto remove Browsing History\n\nIf you want to request or suggest another feature, please contact us at https://stellarapps.co/2021/11/09/contact-us/\n\nSUBSCRIPTION DETAILS:\nUse free for a week, cancel subscription anytime without any charge if you don't like it:\nMonthly Premium Features for $9.99/mon 3 days free trail\nYearly Preminum Feature for $69.99/year with 3 days free trail\n\nPayment: Payment will be charged to the iTunes account within 24-hours prior to the end of the free trial period.\n\nMore on Subscriptions:\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://stellarapps.co/2021/11/09/privacy-policy/\nT&C:\nhttps://stellarapps.co/2021/11/09/terms-conditions/\nSubscription Terms:\nhttps://stellarapps.co/2021/11/09/subscription-terms/"

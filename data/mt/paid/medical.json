      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "The Pill is optimized for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.\n\nHave you ever forgotten to take your birth control pill ? It can happen to any of us but now with The Pill iPhone App, it may never happen again. \n\nThe Pill will remind you to take your birth control pill every day at a time you choose, with a local notification alert (similar to an SMS). The application does not need to be running in order to receive the alert. Works also in plane mode.\n \nWhy not set yourself an alarm on your mobile? \nThe Pill iPhone app is much more than a simple alarm. \n\nThe Pill automatically calculates the 7 days stop period, and the 21 days when you are actually taking the pill. If you are using a 28 day pack then alerts will be sent to you every day. Alerts will not be sent during the 7 days stop period, they only occur during the 21 days when you are actually taking your pill. \n\nYou can see exactly when you have to take your pill, compare your real package with the one in the actual application and see if you have missed a pill or not. \n\nOther features include:  \n\n- Customizable alert sound and background color\n- Alerts received via email\n- Extra alert request option \n\nThe female contraceptive pill is the most popular method of contraception, with 38% of women currently taking it. However, the Pill needs to be used consistently and correctly in order to be effective.  Some types of contraceptive pill have to be taken at exactly the same time every day.  This is why this iPhone app, The Pill, is so important to help prevent unwanted or unplanned pregnancies. \n \nAdvice: take your pill in the morning, if ever you forget to take it, you still can remember it during the day, it won't be too late (after getting asleep, you increase the risk to be more than 12 (or 3) hours late). \n\n-----\nterms & conditions\n\nIn order to receive the notification, you must allow the notifications (settings menu on your iphone) and be connected on internet. WiFi connection may cause problems with notifications especially if the iPhone is in sleep mode, we advice to stay connected with 3G. The Pill also work without internet be you need to let the application running to hear the alarm.\n\nWe cannot be held liable for any breakdowns or faults on our application. Receiving the push notification is not 100% guaranteed even if we do our best to make it work all the time."

      "label": "Simple, fast, yet more thorough than any other pregnancy wheel available for the iPhone, Perfect OB Wheel is better than just a replacement for your trusty paper wheel.\n\nHere's why Perfect OB Wheel is your best choice of gestational calculator:\n\n 1) Input flexibility: Start with one of:\n    • Last menstrual period (LMP)\n    • Conception date\n    • Estimated date of confinement/delivery (EDC)\n    • Ultrasound dating: Number of weeks and days gestation as of a given date (\"X Weeks\").\n\n 2) Input speed: Other wheels for the iPhone make you conform to them for entering your patient's information. Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

Wherever you are within the allied health professions - medical school, nursing school, NP school, PA school, residency, and beyond - you can improve your knowledge base in the short and long term with these key associative memory aids.\n\nMedical Mnemonics puts 1796 clever acronyms, rhymes, and memory tricks on your iPhone or iPod Touch, covering topics ranging from Anatomy and Biochemistry to Pharmacology and Surgery.\n\nThe database is fully searchable and can be quickly filtered by discipline and by system. Create a Favorites list, and search and filter it similarly.\n\nThe best mnemonics can be those you make yourself. Add your own mnemonics to the database, where they'll appear seamlessly alongside those which come with the program.  Submit them instantaneously to the Medical Mnemonics server for review by an MD (that's me!) and inclusion in the next version.\n\nYou can email any mnemonic to a colleague from within Medical Mnemonics. He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human. If you find a mistake, email us; we will pay a $5 bounty per substantive mistake found to the first reporter of that mistake!"

This app does not replace the original manuscript of these landmark critical care trials – instead, it serves as a fast reference and learning tool for some of the most important ICU trials over a wide range of specialties.\n\nEach entry contains a short one-liner about the critical care trial and key points, which includes only the most pertinent details, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, treatment protocols, pertinent endpoints and findings, as well as expert commentary regarding key subgroup analyses or limitations to the trial.\n\nWant to send a colleague a citation? Use the \"Share Trial\" button to send a PubMed link and quick summary. Using this feature, it’s incredibly easy to share pivotal critical care trials with students, residents, and other colleagues.\n\nThe database features 150+ landmark trials related to: ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT/PE, delirium, glycemic control, heart failure, hemorrhage, meningitis, nephroprotection, nutrition, pneumonia, sedation, seizure, sepsis/shock, spinal cord injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage – with more trials and topics to be added on a regular basis!\n\nThis app is designed and maintained by Sean P.

In just ONE app there is 1) a gestational age calculator, 2) an ultrasound biometric calculator, 3) a fetal weight calculator, 4) a list of key weeks and trimesters, 5) an age-adjusted risk table for trisomy 21 and aneuploidy, 6) a BMI calculator, and NOW 7) an Apple Watch app is included with your purchase!\n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 is a state-of-the-art gestational age calculator (also known as an obstetric or pregnancy wheel) that is used every day by doctors, obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and pregnant women. The OB Wheel Pro 7 is a professional tool that replaces the need for multiple apps and it greatly enhances the functionality of those worn-out cardboard wheels without compromise. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 accurately determines the estimated delivery date (EDD), or due date, of a pregnancy based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or from the date of conception, or from a known gestational age (GA) on a known date, e.g. from an ultrasound measurement, or from fetal biometry like Crown-Rump Length (CRL), Femur Length (FL), and BiParietal Diameter (BPD). Additionally, for appropriate gestational ages, The The OB Wheel Pro 7 estimates fetal weight and displays the number of days completed and remaining. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7, besides calculating GA from fetal ultrasound biometrics, enables clinicians to also calculate Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) from FL, BPD, Head Circumference (HC), and Abdominal Circumference (AC) using the most appropriate published reference formula using the maximum and most appropriate parameters.\n\nPrenatal care providers know that there are key gestational ages where testing or interventions are needed. The OB Wheel Pro 7 lets providers see at a glance when these items should be scheduled.\n\nFEATURES\n• Includes Apple Watch app! \n• Gestational Age Calculator from LMP, EDD, Conception Date for any reference date\n• Gestational Age calculated from specific date and gestational age (e.g. ultrasound)\n• Gestational Age Calculator using fetal biometrics (CRL, FL, BPD)\n• Fetal Weight Calculator using HC, AC, FL, BPD\n• Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator\n• Age-Adjusted Risk Table for Trisomy 21 and aneuploidy\n• List of key completed weeks during pregnancy\n• Pregnancy days completed and remaining, and dates for each trimester\n• Remembers last-used EDD\n\n\nPRO TIPS: \n• To enter Gestational Age, CRL, FL, or BPD for a specific date (like for an ultrasound exam), tap \"Today\", enter the desired date, then tap on the button displaying the gestational age to change that button to display options for entering a specific GA, CRL, FL, and BPD. \n• When using the GA calculator, double-tap a date to change the value to the current date.\n• When using the EFW calculator, double-tap a value to clear the value of the selected parameter."

The Cry Translator will tell you. Click “…More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n- Awarded Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n\n-  I love it ! A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

This can happen to men and women, although it is more common in women. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can help to prevent and treat these problems, reducing pelvic floor, bladder and bowel symptoms and supporting the active lifestyle that is important for general health.\n\nSqueezy CF has been designed by chartered physiotherapists specialising in Pelvic Health working in the NHS. It is suitable for everyone who wants to do pelvic floor muscle exercises (also called Kegel exercises). The app is particularly aimed at those who are seeing a specialist physiotherapist for problems connected to their bladder, bowels or pelvic floor muscles as it can be tailored to a specific exercise programme and set to remind you when to do your exercises. It is simple to use, discreet, informative and has helpful visual and audio prompts to support your exercise programme plus it maintains a record of the number of exercises you have completed.\n\nFeatures:\n • Apple Watch support! Be extra discrete, squeeze from your watch\n • Customisable exercise plan\n • “Professional mode” to help physiotherapists set detailed exercise plans for patients\n • Visual, and audio guides for exercises\n • Information and tips written by professional Pelvic Health physiotherapists\n • Track and monitor your progress\n • Write a short note after a completed exercise\n • Simple and clear interface"

      "label": "ObWheel is a handy app that puts the traditional pregnancy dates wheel into the palm of your hand! ObWheel is useful for expectant parents as well as obstetricians, family physicians, nurses, midwives, and students. It uses the date of Last Menstrual Period (LMP) to calculate Estimated Due Date (EDD) and Gestational Age (GA). No more imprecise paper wheels - this tool is always at hand, in your pocket!\n\nWe've separated the outer and inner wheels to make this easy-to-use. Spin the green wheel to set the LMP date. Spin the purple wheel to browse important milestones, and to calculate the gestational age on a specific date (displayed in the middle).\n\nPrefer to enter dates manually? No problem. Select \"Set\" and choose dates by LMP, EDD, or GA on a specific date. Use the \"Info\" screen to see important dates (trimesters, testing and windows) and information on fetal biometry reference ranges (Lessoway) based on current gestational age.\n\nNeed to calculate the EDD from a dating ultrasound report? Rotate the purple wheel until the GA shown matches the GA on the ultrasound report. Then, rotate the green wheel until the date matches the date of the ultrasound. The EDD will be displayed below. Alternatively, input the GA and ultrasound date manually in the \"Set\" screen.\n\nObWheel is a universal app and works on the iPhone and iPad! We are continually working to improve ObWheel, and appreciate your feedback."

We Make Mole Tracking Easy\nYou take pictures of your moles and we store them on your device along with dates and other information. We never upload or save your information anywhere else. It's your health data, and only you should own it.\n\n2. We Help You Analyze\nYou can playback your pictures to see how moles are evolving over time . You can also add color filters to help you identify malignant patterns.\n\n3. We Send You Reminders\nWhen a mole hasn't been scanned in a while, we remind you of it. At intervals of your choosing.\n\n4. Easily Share Your Data With a Doctor\nIf you find a mole that concerns you, you can quickly share your mole history with a dermatologist near you.\n\n5. Keep Your Family Healthy\nCheck your moles and those of your family members directly from the same app.\n\nThis app does *NOT* provide automated diagnoses. Automated diagnoses are inaccurate and can be very dangerous because of the possibility of false negatives. If you are concerned about a mole, go see a doctor immediately!\n\nStart tracking and stay healthy."

      "label": "Managing meals as a diabetic can be hard and frustrating at times. No longer, if you can make use of a proper meal planner.\n\nThis app simplifies food management and allows diabetics to break free of boring routines. Make cooking and trying out new foods exciting again and rediscover the joy in eating out.\n\n\n≡ WHY COUNT CARBS ? ≡\n\nEspecially new, unknown products and their effects on blood sugar levels are often hard to assess and so we all fall into this dull habit of eating the same things - day in, day out. \nCounting carbohydrates is a good solution for many people with diabetes, not just those taking insulin. The International Diabetes Association recommends \"carb counting as an [effective] meal planning technique for managing blood glucose levels\". \n\n\n≡ WHAT DOES IT DO? ≡\n\nThis app was specifically designed for diabetics (type 1 & type 2) and aims to make the whole process easy and simple to use:\n\n• identify carbohydrates in different foods\n• calculate the amount of carbohydrates these foods contain for your serving size / meals\n• start looking at how much insulin to take for the amount of carbohydrates consumed\n\nThe database contains carbohydrate values for thousands of popular foods. Simply set your serving size with the swipe of your finger and add calorie information if you struggle with the weight management part. The calculations necessary for a complete meal are automated and will offer you more flexibility, greater control and freedom of lifestyle. \n\n\n≡ SIMPLE INSULIN MGMT. ≡\n\nIf you take insulin, you can set 1 CU to your preferred “insulin to carbohydrate unit ratio”.\nFor the future, you will know exactly how many shots you will need with each carb unit you consume.\n\nIt is possible to adjust the app from 5 grams to 18 grams of carbohydrates per carb unit (CU) and the app will do all the necessary calculations for you!\n\n\n≡ BENEFITS OF CARB UNITS ≡\n\nOnce you learn how to count carb units, you’ll find it easy to fit a much larger variety of foods into your meal plan. This app will open up options you never knew you had!\n\nTraditionally, diabetics count the total amount of carbohydrates in their food which is difficult to keep track of and makes products hard to compare.\nIf you count carb units instead, very different types of food will become easy to compare - regardless of their weight / serving sizes. So knowing two products have 1 CU (carb unit) is ideal for making quick decisions on what is recommendable to eat.\n\nExample:\n160 g of fresh strawberries and 25 g of french fries from a large fast food company (roughly half the size of a small portion) contain the exact same amount of carbohydrates and therefore 1 carb unit (CU).\n\nSo having a CU table is also great for food comparison and product substitution.\n\n\n\n≡ APP FEATURES ≡\n=> Carb units & calories for thousands of food choices\n=> Adjustable carb unit calculations (5g – 18g of carbohydrates per CU)\n=> Quick, paperless solution to search and find the right foods\n=> Simple serving size calculator for improved accuracy\n=> Save personal serving sizes for later\n=> Save regional foods & personal favorites \n=> Create & sort lists by nutrient, ascending or descending\n=> Nutrient filter to optimize your meal planning\n=> VoiceOver support if you suffer from diabetic retinopathy"

And so it is with ScolioTrack.”\n\nThe technology tracks the patient’s Angle of Trunk Rotation (ATR), which is a key measurement in screening and planning for the Health In Your Hands approach to scoliosis treatment. ScolioTrack also tracks a person’s height, weight and photo record of a persons back, both beneficial for growing teenagers or health-conscious adults with scoliosis. \n\nScolioTrack saves all the information in one convenient location and provides touch of the finger retrieval for future checkups.  An easy-to-read display shows data output in graph format for ease of tracking changes over time and the new technology is capable of saving and tracking the data of multiple users. With ScolioTrack’s access to the latest breaking news regarding the condition, and its user-friendly support guides, patients can gain an effortless handle on their disorder.\n \nFEATURES OF PROGRAM: \n• Simple, attractive, elegant interface.\n• Safer and more affordable than x-rays.\n• Can be used with multiple users and saves their data conveniently on the iPhone for future reference.\n• Tracks and saves a person’s Scoliosis Angle (ATR), a key measurement in screening for and planning treatment of scoliosis.\n• Tracks a person’s height and weight, ideal for growing teenagers with scoliosis or adults who are health conscious.\n• Check your results and Scoliosis changes in beautiful history graph.\n• Camera function takes a photo of the person’s back to notice any changes to the back visually such as rib humps, hip protrusion, body alignment or spinal deviation and compare it easily with previous photo records.\n• Displays the latest news feed on scoliosis to keep users informed and up-to-date.\n• Comprehensive database of frequently asked questions about scoliosis.\n• Full help and easy to follow guides so anyone can track their scoliosis in the comfort of their own home.\n\n-----------------------------------\nABOUT DR KEVIN LAU\nDr. Kevin Lau's ScolioTrack is one element of his comprehensive \"Health In Your Hands\" series for a natural, non-surgical, highly effective and proven method for reversing scoliosis.

      "label": "Focus Builder is optimized for use on an iPad.\n\nEye movements are a very powerful way to exercise the brain and to create long-term change in the brain, known as plasticity.  The “Focus Builder” app contains a variety of exercises which challenge users to voluntarily move their eyes in various patterns, speeds and directions, which have been proven to activate specific parts of the brain depending on which eye movement is performed.\n\nThis app is specifically designed for doctors that specialize in Functional Neurology and their patients.  There is currently no app available that can provide these specific exercises.  For best results, patients should consult a Functional Neurologist to determine how to use this app according to their needs and obtain the most therapeutic value.\n\nThere are 3 types of eye movements that can have profound therapeutic benefits and all three are available in this app.  \n1.Pursuits (slow eye movements):  Smooth pursuit eye movements allow the eyes to closely follow a moving object.  Most people are unable to initiate pursuit without a moving visual signal. The pursuit of targets moving with velocities of greater than 30°/s tend to require catch-up saccades.\n2.Saccades (fast eye movements):  Saccades are quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction.  Initiated cortically by the frontal eye fields (FEF), or subcortically by the superior colliculus, saccades serve as a mechanism for fixation, rapid eye movement, and the fast phase of optokinetic nystagmus.\n3.Anti-saccades (look away):  The anti-saccade task has emerged as an important task for investigating the flexible control that we have over behavior. In this task, participants must suppress the reflexive urge to look at a visual target that appears suddenly in the peripheral visual field and must instead look away from the target in the opposite direction. A crucial step involved in performing this task is the top-down inhibition of a reflexive, automatic saccade. Patients diagnosed with various neurological and/or psychiatric disorders that affect the frontal lobes or basal ganglia find it difficult to suppress the automatic pro-saccade, revealing a deficit in top-down inhibition.\n\nThe areas of the brain that are activated by these eye movements are too numerous to list, but to name a few, I have listed some of the functions that can improve with these eye exercises.\n1.Executive function/behavior\n2.Attention\n3.Concentration\n4.Impulse control\n5.Social behavior\n6.Motivation\n7.Goal directed behavior"

Carried in the pockets, phones and emergency vehicles of millions of first responders, this is the guide EMS Magazine calls “the original and still the best.”\n\nThe EMS Field Guide app puts critical information at your fingertips with rich content, detailed illustrations and pioneering features. This app is available in two editions— Advanced Life Support (ALS) and Basic & Intermediate Life Support (BLS)—designed specifically to correspond with each tier of EMT certification and practice, so you know you have the right tool for your job.\n\nThe Advanced Life Support (ALS) app equips the Paramedic or EMT-P to triage and address trauma. It provides fast, easy access to vital assessment information, medications, and drug doses; quick interpretation of 12-Lead EKGs; and the latest CPR and ACLS algorithms from the American Heart Association (AHA). The ALS app is also suitable for Intermediates whose practice orders require a more detailed understanding of these topics. \n\nREVIEWS\n\n“The EMS Field Guide by Informed is probably the most popular pocket reference guide carried on ambulances across the country.”\n\n“I love your guides. I’ve been a paramedic for 25 years and your ALS guides are the best source of reliable on-scene information.”\n\n“This is a great review tool as well as a resource.”\n\n“…Highly recommended in some of my advanced cardiac life support training courses.”\n\n“One of the best things a paramedic can have. A cheat sheet for the things you may not always remember.”\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nInformed Publishing offers a full product line of references for the medical and first response markets, as well as a consumer line for home and family emergency preparedness. Informed references are available in a variety of formats: pocket-size print guides, and now, apps for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.

Particularly children incline to fight against illnesses with fever. \nIf you go to the doctor, it is good to know the exact course of the fever, because according to fever pattern and other symptoms the doctor can diagnose faster. \nAbove all, if several members of the family are ill at the same time, you can keep the optimum overview with your fever diary.\n\n\nWith FEVER you grasp simply and intuitively:\n● Temperature and fever measuring zones (mouth, ear, arm, forehead or Rectal)\n● Medication and dose (e.g., Paracetamol, 1 tablet)\n● Events and condition (e.g., headaches, vomiting)\n● Notes\n\nOther features:\n● Fever and illness adjustable for several people\n● Easy representation of the temperature curve by means of graph\n● Direct comparison to previous measurements (arrow and value)\n● Directly representation of fever classification\n● Support for Celsius and Fahrenheit\n● Support of 'Landscape' view layout\n● \"Tell-A-Friend\" function\n\nNotes:\n● This program is not a substitute for a doctor's visit! With fever a doctor needs always to be consulted!\n● Neither the iPhone/iPad nor this App is able to MEASURE the body temperature! (e.g. Breathing 2 minutes into the microphone is neither usable nor precise)"

      "label": "This product provides a set of comprehensive Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) tools that complement both therapy and books on the subject.  The mood monitor tool facilitates the collection of data based on our current mood. Lifestyle choices and mood tags can also be selected. Diagrams can be produced to help make sense of the collected data and to help recognise patterns.\n\nThe Thoughts Feelings and Behaviour Cycle tool (TFB) allows the collection of data that is represented in a graphical way. This is a useful tool to identify problems and help you change your outlook.\n\nThe Activity list facilitates the creation of activities that can be achievement based, pleasurable or both. Activities are a great way to become more active and combat depression and low self esteem.\n\nThe Activity scheduler takes activities from your list of identified activities and allows you to add these to the default calendar on the device. When the activity is completed, you can rate the activity based on pleasure, sense of achievement and mood.\n\nHelpful thoughts are a great way of evaluating our negative thoughts. Build a list and rate them, and carry them with you on your phone or tablet.\n\nMotivation tips allow you to identify ways of achieving your goals and aid with getting started. Build a list and rate them to browse at your leisure.\n\nCoping Strategies are a great way of dealing with stressful situations. Build a list and rate them. This tool is beneficial when we feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe Sleep Strategies tool allows you to identify and rate solutions to sleep related problems.\n\nIt is important to identify meaningful goals to combat depression. Use the goals tool to create realistic, achievable goals and break them down into manageable chunks. The progress of the goal can be adjusted as you attain the goal, and completed when finished.\n\nThe thought experiment tool allows you to experiment with a particular thought, add a prediction and rate our belief in the prediction. Possible problems can be identified and outcomes and what has been learned documented. The whole experiment can be exported at leisure to PDF format for printing and review."

      "label": "Taking the deaf world by storm and featured in the news, Deafwake was created by a deaf person and is designed to ensure everyone can get up when they’re supposed to. Removing the risk of sleeping in and being late for meetings, it allows deaf individuals or heavy sleepers to be on time, every time. \n\nDeaf Wake, an LED / Vibration / Visual based alarm app for people who are deaf, hearing Impaired or just want a really cool alarm clock.\n\nThis deaf app will be your best friend as well as your worse enemy (if you don't like being woken up) It is designed to utilise all the senses of your iPhone. It has a flashing screen, it vibrates, it uses the camera flash and is loud.\n\nThe app has hit all four corners of the globe, including the UK, USA, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Denmark, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, and Mexico. And with more than 1,000 downloads on the App Store, and over 500,000 Facebook users reached, the app has proven to be a huge hit with those who struggle daily with the realities of being deaf or hard of hearing. \n\nSee video of app in action - https://www.facebook.com/deafwake/#\n\n*********************\n\nThe App has an easy interface where you can select the camera flash, have a flashing screen, have it vibrate or use sound. You may select one or two or even use all the senses of your iPhone.\n\nNot all senses may be appropriate for every scenario for an example during a work meeting you may not want the phone to rudely interrupt you by sound or vibration. A discreet flashing screen telling you that your child needs to be picked up from nursery may be more appropriate.\n\n*********************\n\nBe Alert /////\nNever be late again. Never burn the Sunday roast. Never miss meetings. All because you didn't hear the phone (or didn't feel it vibrating)\n\nChoose Your Senses /////\nChoose the flashing screen. Just have the phone vibrate. Set the camera flash. Be alerted by sound. Or have all four turned on.\n\nDescriptive Alarms /////\nUniquely give each alarm setting a description. A description could be 'Make your partner a cup of tea to get out of the doghouse'\n\nMade By A Deaf Person /////\nAn app designed by a hearing impaired person with deaf people in mind (or just plain heavy sleepers)\n\nApple Watch /////\nThe App is also designed to work with the Apple Watch. You can use the Apple Watch to also set your alarms as well as other features.\n\nChoose Clock Interfaces /////\nChoose from a selection of two clock faces. Simply swipe left or right. You may prefer an easier analogue clock.\n\n*********************\n\nNo longer do you have to put the phone under your pillow or in your pocket in order to (hopefully) be woken up. At night put the iPhone at the side of the bed and let it flash to wake you up (using the flashing screen and camera flash). Put the iPhone on the kitchen table whilst chopping carrots to remind you to take the roast out of the oven. Settle down, watch a movie and let the App tell you when its time to go to bed.\n\n*********************\n\nAs a long life deaf person I have been frustrated with the lack of innovation designed for deaf people in technology. One problem I have had is a suitable alarm clock or timer that appropriately notifies me. This App was born out of frustration and was initially just developed for my own personal use.\n\nSteven Mifsud\nDeafWake Designer \n\n*********************\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/deafwake\n\nWhat are you waiting for!\n\nGet this superb app today\n\nFor less than a price of coffee, download this App today and be amazed! Tell your friends and family, please do be sure to leave a review on the Apple AppStore.\n\nNOTE - App must be running. Set the alarm and put the phone facedown (so screen goes black), upright or in your pocket etc. Don't turn phone off via the switch or home button as it is not possible to bypass the notification system when the iPhone is locked. This is the same for ALL Apps and other alarm clocks.\n\n*********************"

      "label": "The ADNEX risk model can be used by medical doctors to preoperatively estimate the likelihood that an ovarian (including para-ovarian and tubal) tumor is benign, borderline, a stage I cancer, stage II-IV cancer, or secondary metastatic cancer (i.e. metastasis of non-adnexal cancer to the ovary). The model is based on data derived from women found to have at least one adnexal tumor that was judged not to be physiological, underwent a standardized ultrasound examination, and was later selected for surgery. \n\nThe ADNEX model contains nine predictors: age, serum CA-125 (U/ml), type of center (oncology vs other), maximum lesion diameter, proportion of solid tissue, number of papillary projections, the presence of >10 cyst locules, acoustic shadows, and ascites. An oncology center is defined as a tertiary referral center with a specific gynecological oncological unit. \n\nThe model was developed by clinicians and statisticians from the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) group, and is based on clinical and ultrasound data from almost 6000 women recruited at 24 centers in 10 countries (Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Czech Republic, Poland, France, UK, China, Spain, and Canada).\n\nA full description of model development and validation is given in Van Calster B, Van Hoorde K, Valentin L, Testa AC, Fischerova D, Van Holsbeke C, Savelli L, Franchi D, Epstein E, Kaijser J, Van Belle V, Czekierdowski A, Guerriero S, Fruscio R, Lanzani C, Scala F, Bourne T, Timmerman D.

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

Using the GPS features of this app can significantly affect battery life. Only leave GPS enabled when you need to use it.

This app uses data from the amazing community driven open mapping project called openstreetmap.org!  Coverage detail may vary by region, please visit our website to check the map detail for your regions of interest.\n   3.

Use Ankor as an anchor watch when you need your boat to move only in the specified safe area. If the movement outside this safe area is detected, Ankor will warn you.\n\nHave you ever been told that in some city or place is safe to walk only in the specified area? Use Ankor as a GPS alarm to be warned, when you are leaving this safe area.\n\nYou can easily do with Ankor:\n- set the radius of the safe area\n- set manually the safe area location tapping on the map\n- see your recent movement\n- see your actual latitude and longitude\n- center the safe area to the current location\n- specify, if you want to be notified only once, or till you dismiss the alarm\n- set up a location accuracy to save the battery life\n- use your iPhone and still be warned, thanks to Ankor watching in the background\n\nIf you have any questions, problems or ideas to make Ankor better for you, please write us an email (support@creativefactory.io).\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. To save the battery life, you can switch location accuracy levels."

      "label": "Keep calm. With DragAlarm you can relax in your boat, on the beach, at the bar or wherever you want. This app stands watch and notifies you if the anchor is improperly secured and your boat is dragging.\n\nActivate DragAlarm when you're letting go the chain or once you’re anchored. Just following a few steps the app calculates the swinging radius or otherwise you can enter it manually. Once it has been configured, you will see the map with the location of the anchor on the screen, the swinging circle and the ship with her tracking. Remember that you should let go the chain at least 3 times the depth to ensure a good anchorage.\n\n- No internet connection required. (Except for the alert via email).\n- It is recommended to use the app with the iPhone / iPad plugged in.\n- Setting the map type: map, hybrid or satellite.\n- Setting the GPS accuracy to save battery power.\n- Changing measurement units: meters, feet or fathoms.\n- Alert via email with information regarding dragging distance, position, time, GPS error and battery level.\n- Ability to respond to the alert on your Apple Watch.\n\n\nWARNING\nA continued use of the GPS in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life.\n\nDragAlarm makes use of the GPS antenna. Take into account that not all iOS devices have this inbuilt antenna and therefore this app may not work properly. All iPhones do have the antenna. Only the 3G Cellular iPad with data connection has GPS antenna.\n\n\nDrag Alarm is an app developed by Marinus.\nMarinus, improving the maritime sector.\n\nMarinus Apps\nwww.marinusapps.com"

      "label": "Professional Augmented Reality Bearing Compass with real-time camera and map views, bearing markers and up to 8x zoom providing Compass Binocular features at a fraction of the cost.\n\n\"..works nicely, we tried it out at the Voiles d'Antibes...the Captain's response when trying it out was 'Cool!'.\" - Boatbookings, The World's Leading Online Yacht Charter Broker\n\nCompass Eye can be used to help with navigation on land, sea  or air as a bearing or marching compass.\n\nCompass Eye is fully gimballed and works accurately in all orientations and angles when held vertical and horizontal.\n\n“This app is a compass on steroids! It is fully gimballed so it will work in any orientation on your iPhone or iPad.  You can use it on land while hiking or as a hand bearing compass on the ocean or in the air while flying.” i-Marine Apps\n\n\"The app's compass works way better than the iOS default compass and I don't have to wave my iPhone in the air every time I launch the app.\" Gizmodo Review (App of The Day, 6th December).\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n- Real time, accurate in all orientations\n- Compass overlaid on live camera view\n- 8x Digital zoom\n- Back, transit, or collision bearing markers\n- Draggable Green and red bearing lines\n- Triangulation bearings\n- Optional time, date and GPS location information\n- Magnetic or True North setting with variation based on location\n- Live map view with position and track\n- Artificial Horizon with roll and pitch readout\n- Night Vision and FLIROne® Infra-red support\n- Location sharing\n- Longitude and latitude degree display in DD° MM.mmm', DD° MM' SS.ss\" and now DD.ddd°\n- iOS Dark mode support\n- Full screen on iPhoneX and later devices\n\nEnabling GPS also shows the Speed Over Ground (SOG) , Course Over Ground (COG) and optional COG bearing (purple).\n\nHOW TO USE\n\nTaking a bearing - look through your iPhone at the distant object, line it up with the centre line and read off the bearing! Zoom in to get more accuracy.\n\nSetting a bearing - look through your iPhone at the point you want to get to, tap the Bearing button (Top right) and follow the yellow  bearing line.\n\nSetting a bearing from the map - lay the iPhone flat, rotate or drag a bearing line  to line up with the point you are aiming for  and follow that bearing.\n\nTriangulation - use  the three bearing lines - yellow green and red to take bearings on 3 points. Capture the view including compass, bearings, time and location information (Camera button on left of screen)  and then use the photo to plot a fix on a chart.\n\nClearance bearings to a point on an approach - set one line to the minimum bearing (e.g. the angle the target must bear greater than) and the other line to the maximum bearing and navigate between the two. Use the colours according to the IALA lateral markings to help you remember which way to steer. e.g. in North America use red for the minimum bearing and green for the maximum (vice-versa in Europe!).\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nBased on the iPhone camera the image specification at full zoom compares favourably with a 7x50 pair of binoculars:\n- Field of Vision at 1000m at 8x: 122m\n- Angle of view at 8x: approx 7 degrees\n- ISO 3200 or better.\n\nNAVIGATION SAFETY\nCompass Eye should only be used for basic navigation assistance. Never rely solely on the digital compass for determining direction, proximity or distance. The user is responsible for the prudent use of information provided by this application and must not use it for direct navigation. \n \nRequirements: iOS device with back facing Camera, Magnetometer and accelerometer (gps is optional).\n\nN.B. Battery consumption can go up considerably when the iPhone's GPS is enabled, Compass Eye allows you to turn off location display to preserve battery life.\n\nTerms of Use: http://seanav.net/termsofuse.php\n\nPrivacy Policy: http://seanav.net/privacy.php\n\nSupport: help@pocketmariner.com"

      "label": "TrafficCamNZ displays internet accessible pictures of Traffic Cameras all over the world. Use it for any image with a fixed URL (web address).\n\nImages you choose as \"Featured\" are downloaded and setup side by side so that you can swipe across the screen to view multiple images quickly.\nTrafficCamNZ works over the cellular network though it works best with WiFi because, usually, it's faster!\n\nTrafficCamNZ can also use the GPS features in your device to show cameras around you. Try the predictive mode that predicts where you are travelling to display the next cameras (with known GPS coordinates) on your journey.\n\nTrafficCamNZ now contains details of more than 7000 cameras from around the world. You choose which cameras are the \"featured\" ones. Featured cameras are easily identified in the Library; they have a Green dot next to them.\nManaging your own personal list of cameras is easy too. This can be done in two ways:\n1. Enter a new camera directly on the iPhone and key in the entire URL (http://mywebsite/image.jpg) or\n2. Create your own XML file for importing into the application. Instructions on how to do this are available at the support web site or by contacting the developer.\n\nUsage Notes:\n* Pictures are displayed in the order they are received unless you set the image sequence number, you can then order the images how you want them\n* Check your network usage when downloading over the cellular network\n* Images are not cached, if you receive an image that isn't right (i.e. daylight when you know it is night time, that camera may not be functioning)\n* Sometimes the traffic camera pictures are not up-to-date. You may see night pictures when it is supposed to be daylight or perhaps pictures don't change. TrafficCamNZ has no control over that\n* You receive updates to the camera list automatically; a check is performed every 7 days when the application starts\n* Tap the image on the main window to display it full screen\n\nFeatures:\n* Easily flick through the loaded images with your finger - this was the original idea behind the application\n* Load your own web images\n* Free version available, loads up to 3 images\n* Full version available, loads up to 19 images on iPhone and 32 images on iPad\n* Allows XML import of camera list\n* Camera list (XML Import file) can be updated from a web site - doesn't require the release of a new application\n* No advertising\n\nMany great comments from around the world have been made about TrafficCamNZ:\n* Great little app, what a time saver. I would often leave work to find the traffic all congested, now I can check before I leave and even if it gets busy I can check on the road and take a different route. I have set my own cameras and can quickly check what's what. A real must for driving commuters, couriers or even taxi's. \n* This app works very well and is awesome if you travel a lot. Going on a road trip for work or vacation?  Google the cameras for your cities, insert the URL into the app, and cameras appear \n* I set it up for all the traffic cameras from Douglas County down through El Paso County (Colorado) and it works great!  So well in fact, that I sprung for the paid version\n* Make sure you enter in the URL's correctly - that's where some people mess up.  What you see is basically what the traffic/weather cam sees wherever they are. They have to be viewable on the Internet first. Awesome app!\n* App is very easy to use and I use it for going to work every day\n* I put 2 of the most important traffic cams on the way to work and it works perfect"

      "label": "Featured by Apple in “Best New Apps”!\n\nPlan your next trip. Mark places you want to go. Remember your favorite spots. Across town or across the world, you’ll never forget another place with Pinbox!\n\nAdd pins where you are, where you’ve been, or where you want to go. Pinbox makes it easy to quickly record and organize your important places into distinct maps for every activity, occasion, or geographic region.\n\nUnlike other apps, Pinbox doesn’t force you to save all your places on a single map. You can make one map for your favorite local restaurants - make another map for your next business trip or vacation - and make another map for errands you need to run this weekend. The possibilities are endless!\n\nPinbox is about you and your places. It’s not a social network. You don’t have to create an account or enter your Facebook details to use the app. Your maps aren’t cluttered with random places bookmarked by strangers. Pinbox is simply the best app for privately bookmarking places that are important to YOU!\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Simple, easy-to-use interface\n• Drop a pin for each place you want to remember\n• Add photos, notes, and other details to each pin\n• Choose from seven different pin colors\n• Organize your pins into separate maps\n• See your location in relation to your pins\n• Send maps to other Pinbox users\n• Send pins to Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze, or Transit for directions\n• Save up to 2,500 pins\n• Display maps in Standard, Hybrid, or Satellite\n\nEXAMPLES OF MAPS YOU MIGHT CREATE\n\n• Travel planning\n• Favorite restaurants or restaurants to try\n• Customer locations / sales calls\n• Friends and family locations\n• Real Estate listings\n• Favorite hiking / biking trails\n• Secret fishing spots\n• Dog-friendly places\n• Parking spots\n• Favorite stores\n• Multi-stop errands\n• Potential photoshoot locations\n• The list goes on and on and on…\n\n\nStill not convinced? Here’s a few of our favorite reviews…\n\n\n“Pinbox is one of those simple apps that does one thing so well it feels frictionless”.\n-- Stephen Grassie\n\n\n“The interface is gorgeous - I would say that it looks like something Apple designed”.\n-- Macaddict\n\n\n“I have been using this to keep track of all the places the kids and I go so they can see how spread out our world is and they can see where all we have gone. Will use it forever”.\n-- 1Cool Daddy\n\n\n“This app is extremely useful and so simple to use. A lifesaver for keeping track of locations”.\n-- Davies Photo\n\n\n“I love this app. It is exactly what it claims to be. I have wanted this app since the smartphone was invented. So simple, and so many uses”.\n-- T1Man\n\n\n\nUsing Pinbox on an iPod Touch or an iPad:\nLike other map apps, Pinbox uses GPS to determine your location. iPods and Wi-Fi-only iPads do not have a GPS receiver. On these devices, Pinbox provides your approximate location using information based on your proximity to known Wi-Fi networks (when on and available). The more accurate the available information, the smaller the circle identifying your position on the map. This feature is not available in all areas. Known Wi-Fi networks are predominantly in urban areas. An internet connection is required to load maps, look up addresses, and search. Although Pinbox can be installed on iPads, it’s not formatted for the larger iPad screen - it runs doubled like all other iPhone apps.\n\n\n\nPinbox is the result of a collaboration between Scott D. Smith and Paul Burd. We sincerely hope you like it!"

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

You can also purchase 1:10,000 maps for selected urban areas which show more detail than the free 1:10,000 maps.\n\nOnce you've downloaded the detailed maps that you need, an internet connection is not required.\n\nThe app can load GPX files (for example, from websites, other apps and from nearby devices via AirDrop) and display waypoints, tracks and routes.  You can also mark waypoints, plan routes and record tracks within the app, and export them.\n\nYou can view graphs of altitude or speed along recorded tracks and routes.\n\nThe app has a 3D mode that lets you view the terrain from any viewpoint, useful for visualising hills and mountains.\n\nThe app also includes a searchable gazetteer containing over 250,000 place names, 850,000 street names and 1.6 million post codes. All of this data is built in to the app, so this search also works when there is no network connection.\n\nThe app also supports the compass and GPS - on those devices that have them - to display your position, orientation and altitude.\n\nPaid maps are licensed for personal and non-commercial use only.\n\nContains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database rights 2011 - 2021.

For example, an E6B can be used to calculate heading and groundspeed after taking into account forecast winds. An E6B is also used to calculate data used for performance planning such as density altitude.  Our version goes beyond the analog E6B and even beyond all other E6B apps by including functionality to calculate time, rate and radius of turns, pivotal altitude (great for flight training use), and more."

We love this mode! We found it much more convenient compared to traditional car dashboards (especially on the roads of Western Europe, which are full of speed cameras and where you need to watch your speedometer all the time). And last but not the least - it just looks cool.  Note: this mode works pretty well at night time and twilight, but on direct sunlight the screen brightness can be insufficient.\n\n- \"aSmart HUD\" can keep track on 4 speed limits, giving a warning (sound and visual) each time you crossing it. Normally, it's legal speed limits within cities, local roads and high-speed motorways. \"Never exceed speed\" is the speed you should not exceed under any conditions. For example, it can be a technical limit of your vehicle or the point where government can arrest your driving license. \n\n- You can skip/rewind/play/pause your current iPod music track, select the playlist or set the Shuffle or Repeat iPod mode.\n\n- Weather forecast time intervals and temperature units (C, F) are selectable in Preferences.\n\n- You can quickly take a photo of what's going on the road. Photo will be automatically saved into the Photos Album. The speedometer image, map and a some of other useful information will be placed over your photo. \n\n- Landscape and Portrait screen layouts support.\n\n- Three different compass styles, sound themes, colors, etc.\n\n- 4 functionally different display themes.\n\n- Speed history log chart. \n\n- \"Location Info\"  - longitude and latitude, GPS measurement precision and some more data.\n\n- \"Records\" screen (left upper button on the \"Location Info\" screen), where you can see your maximum reached speed (during the current trip or all of your trips), maximum altitude and maximum distance from start.\n\n- Tap the speed indicator to switch into speed fullscreen mode. \n \nIMPORTANT: for more screenshots and details visit the http://atoll-ordenadores.com website\n\nLimitations \n- The precision is affected by the satellite signal quality. If unsure, use the program only for reference, don't rely on it for 100%. Application requires real A-GPS chip - so, no iPod and not-3G iPad supported. On iPad 3G application function only in \"double pixel\" mode.\n\nThanks to everyone for your suggestions about additional functionality! THE BEST AND FASTEST WAY TO CONTACT US IS SENDING YOUR REQUESTS AND BUG REPORTS to support@atoll-ordenadores.com. WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED  IN DIALOG, what is not possible when you leaving the bug-report as AppStore review."

      "label": "What is WikiFarms Australia?\n\nWikiFarms Australia is the essential application for backpackers looking for a farm job in Australia. Whether you are looking for a casual job during your trip or aiming to complete your 88 days of farm work to get your Second Year Visa, WikiFarms Australia will be your guide!\nThe application will help you to be in direct contact with farmers by making available a map with thousands of farms around Australia!\nThe database is always growing and constantly being updated by our team: companies are added weekly, contacts are regularly verified, making it the largest database for fruit picking jobs in Australia! With more than 2000 companies listed in the app you’ll have all the information you need to find a farm job quickly.\n\n \nSo do not wait to get the best farm job tool available in Australia!\n\n \nWhat can I do with the app?\n\nWikiFarms Australia makes it easy to find a farm. Simply use the map screen to see exactly where are located the farms. Then tap a site to bring up its description. It will show you the name of the company, type of crops, phone number, and, for some of them, website and email. You can then call the farmers directly from the app and ask them if they need workers. If you are ready to go, you can also start an itinerary from your current location and ask them in person!\n\nThe app also allows you to use filters. If you are looking to work in a specific area or to pick a specific type of fruit during a specific time, you can do that!\n\nThe app lists also tons of working hostels, tourism offices, working agencies that can give you more information or help to find a job in a specific area.\n\nWith the app you can also calculate your 88 days of farm work easily and see if you’re ready to apply for the Second (or Third soon!) Year Visa.\n\n \nWho made WikiFarms Australia?\n\nFellow backpackers like you created WikiFarms Australia! When we were looking for farm work to get our Second Year Visa, we really struggled knowing where to look for farms! There was some information here and there but nothing really consistent. This is when we started to think about a tool that will have all the farmers at once and WikiFarms Australia started just like that J\n\n \nWhy is the app not free?\n\nWe are a very small team working on this project for more than 2 years! As a result, the profit of the app really helps us to make it better day after day. In addition, it also contributes to our travelling passion (which we are sure that if you are here you can relate!)\n\nIn addition, you certainly think that most apps are free, but are they really? Most of the time, free apps are full of unwanted and annoying ads and you often have to pay more to have the full use of it.\n\nWe made the choice to offer a complete, advertising-free experience for as low of a price as we could make it. Consider that half the price you pay for it goes to taxes and Google share.\n\nThe application helps you get what you need the most, find a farm job, and when you will get it, its price will be covered in less than half an hour of work!\n\nThanks for your purchase and we hope that you’ll have a good experience with our app!\n\n \nFeel free to join us on our Facebook page or to visit our website:\nhttps://wikifarmsaustralia.com/\n\n \nAre you a farmer looking for workers? You can contact us at: info.wikifarms@gmail.com\nWe will answer you within 24h."

      "label": "Save time and money on your instrument flight training by mastering IFR holding pattern entries at the comfort of your own mobile device.\n\nMake IFR flight training easier!\n\nIs the following scenario familiar? You receive a holding clearance from ATC, and only have a couple of minutes, sometimes only a few seconds, to choose the correct entry. By the time you've figured out what's going on, you've already passed the holding fix and don't know what to do next.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, then you need not to worry. Confusion during holding entries happens to practically almost every new instrument student. Even instrument-rated pilots occasionally have the same problem — when they don't get enough practice.\n\nHolding Trainer solves this problem and as a result, cuts the time you have to spend on expensive flight and ground lessons. With Holding Trainer, you can practice on your own time and convenience, so that choosing the best holding entry in the air becomes a breeze. \n\n\nFeatures: \n\n-Entry Trainer - Drills you on choosing the best holding entry. Practice until choosing holding entries becomes second nature and impress your flight instructor with your skills.\n\n-Holding calculator. Solve and visualize any holding scenario by entering your current bearing to the fix and a outbound or inbound holding radial. \n\n-Holding tutorial - learn how to choose the best holding entry quickly and easily.\n\nHolding Trainer for iOS is a complete rewrite based on my popular Flash-based desktop Holding Trainer app available on pilotscafe.com.\n\n***Don't get \"stuck\" next time you receive a holding pattern clearance!***\n----------------------------------\nFor only a fraction of the cost of one ground lesson with your flight instructor, you can practice this important instrument skill at your own pace and save hundreds of Dollars on figuring out holding entries in the air.\n\nThis is a great tool for anyone training towards their instrument checkride, CFII, proficiency check, or simply trying to improve their holding patterns.\n----------------------------------"

Application will display your current position on the route and display the route on the map.  Every route is saved in the application database, so you don't need to re-create it every time application starts up.\n\n - Tapping the \"HUD\" icon mirrors all the text, so if you position the iPhone horizontally under your car's windscreen you can see perfectly readable half-transparent reflection of the picture displayed.  Note: this mode works pretty well at night time and twilight, but on direct sunlight the screen brightness can be insufficient. \n\n- aSmartHUD can keep track on 4 speed limits, giving a warning each time you crossing it. Normally, it's legal speed limits within cities, local roads and high-speed motorways. \"Never exceed speed\" is the speed you should not exceed under any conditions. Like technical limit of your vehicle or the point where government can arrest your driving license. \n\n- 3D Trip Log Graph - unique way to represent the speed, location and altitude data in a single 3D graph. Color coded speed and altitude chart is constantly adjusted according to your moving trajectory.

      "label": "Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s, adding modern features and technologies.  The app uses advanced OpenGL graphics (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers nine different compass modes with direct read, traditional, and rosette styles capable of displaying degrees, quads, or mils (the direct read mode shows a North-South needle and reversed East-West convention).  In all display modes, Pro Compass shows both magnetic and true direction simultaneously, with a rotating outer true ring that is automatically adjusted for local magnetic declination.  Sun and Moon position are marked on the compass rings and continually updated.\n\nPro Compass displays location and altitude, with decimal, degree-minute-second, UTM, and MGRS position formats.  An optional \"Datum Pack\" adds over 230 geodetic datums covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.  The app also contains a built in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level.  The inclinometer has angle readout dials for each axis, making it useful for many different types of measurements including slopes, pitches, sight lines, and geological angles like dip and strike. \n\nAfter using Pro Compass, you'll see why it's the best and most realistic compass available on the App Store!  Also be sure to check out the new Pro Compass for Watch, available for all Apple Watch models running watchOS 6 or later.\n\n***** IMPORTANT ACCURACY NOTE *****\n\nPro Compass reports accuracy directly from the magnetometer sensor in your device.  This accuracy is determined by the hardware, not the application itself.\n\nTo improve results, operate Pro Compass away from any electronics or other sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.  \n\nPlease contact the developer via the support link if you need additional information about accuracy or operation of Pro Compass."

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Jonathan J. Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe used his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nCreated on the battlefield, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused navigation app available on the App Store. It is also the only combat-proven app available today. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin. You can add as many Kin as you like to calculate the Combined Kin for a group of people. \n\n+ Tzolkin with indication of the GAP day's and Wavespell and more. Tap and hold to select a Kin number directly.\n\n+ Contact Import \nAll contacts in your Contacts App will be automatically imported and assigned to the correct Kin. See all your contacts with their Mayan Reading and how you relate to them. \n\n+ 13 Moon Calendar \nFull integration of 13 Moon Calendar. (doubles as a birthday calendar!) \n\n+ 13:20 Information \nLots of information about the theory behind synchronization to help you navigate the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar. The texts provide a clear explanation of the Cycles of Time. (More than 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\n+ Sharing\nOn all the 3 main tabs you can share the current selected Galactic Signature using your favorite app. \n\n\n# Based on the work of José Argüelles.\n# This app was made with permission of and in cooperation with the Foundation for the Law of Time - www.lawoftime.org, \n# Ariel Spilsbury."

      "label": "Are you a pilot, sailor or an outdoor adventurer ? Then the Digital Bearing Compass augmented reality app will be a valuable tool for you. Aim at objects in sight and directly read the true and magnetic bearing. Then you can check your bearings on the map. In addition, the current position, including the altitude above sea level is displayed.\n\nOr you can set a fix in the map view. Bearing and distance to the fix is constantly computed. In the camera view, the difference angle between current bearing and the fix is also displayed. There is also a red marker at the location of the fix in camera view displayed by augmented reality technology.\n\nSince version 3.x you can also set a mark on the current location. This mark is also displayed in the camera view. The app shows the distance and bearing to this marked location.\n\nBy taking 2 bearings or by using the fix, you can measure the angle between 2 points or objects ... if you are a sailor or yachtsman, you know what you can do with this information. You can use them directly for navigation, since this corresponds to the functionality of a sextant. You can also use trigonometry to determine the size of a distant object. By getting 2 bearings you can also apply the method of cross bearing directly. The bearings are automatically saved, so they will be available when you start the app the next time.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- The App uses the high-tech sensors of your iPhone or iPad to measure orientation, device and declination (the angle between the direction to Geographic North and Magnetic North, pilots call it variation).\n\n- Augmented reality technology, available since iOS 11. The app will also be continuously improved, further developed and equipped with new features.\n\n- You can switch between camera mode and map mode.\n\n- The angle between 2 points or objects can be measured.\n\n- A fix can be set in map view which is shown also in camera view.\n\n- You can set a mark on the actual position. This mark is also displayed in the camera view.\n\n- The position and direction of the bearings and the fix are drawn in the map.\n\n- This way a cross bearing is possible.\n\n- day/night mode\n\n- you can choose between different coordinate formats\n\n- you can choose between different distance and altitude units\n\n- the cardinal directions are shown in the camera view\n\n\nNo matter if you are a pilot, seal, scientist, astronomer, technician, geographer or outdoor athlete, you will find the app extremely valuable for your orientation and navigation. And it is fun.\n\nPlease note that some sensors require a time to calibrate. Sometimes it might be the case that after starting the app, for a few seconds a wrong direction will be displayed. The camera should be moved slowly back and forth in this case so that the device can perform the calibration.\n\nThe app needs the permission to use the GPS. No data will be sent from the app to the outside world.\n\nThe app also uses augmented reality, a brand new technology which is supported only by the newest devices. You need at least an iPhone 6s or later, an iPad pro 2nd generation or later, or an iPad 2017 or later. Future devices will all support augmented reality."

Sei il benvenuto.\nPrima di partire, però, devi sapere che in molte città italiane, a differenza di quelle europee, esistono delle zone urbane in cui è impossibile accedere con l'automobile. Le Zone a Traffico Limitato (ZTL) sono sorvegliate dai vigili urbani e protette da telecamere che controllano gli accessi. Alcune di esse sono in funzione 24 ore su 24, altre vengono aperte agli automobilisti solo per alcune ore al giorno.  Se per caso dovessi accedere in una di queste zone, saresti costretto a pagare una multa che va dagli 80,00 euro ai 335,00 euro. Lo sappiamo, ti sembrano cifre assurde ma in Italia le regole sono queste.\nNon preoccuparti più del dovuto, però!  Scarica ZTL Italia e parti sicuro e informato. \nQuest'app è l'unica che contiene una mappa aggiornata con tutte le ZTL d'Italia. Facilissima ed attendibile, funziona come un navigatore. Grazie ad un sistema di allarme personalizzato, ogni volta che ti avvicinerai ad una ZTL una voce ti avvertirà in tempo e ti dirà se la zona è aperta o chiusa. Puoi avere ZTL Italia anche nel centro notifica del tuo smartphone o Tablet perché include il widget. \n\nVisita l'Italia senza brutte sorprese, scarica ZTL Italia e buon viaggio!\n\n*** Ultimo aggiornamento varchi: 29 Marzo 2017 ***"

      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

It benefits from an interface derived from the “Routing & Navigation” version.\n\nWeather\nGFS model is provided by default.  In addition, over 35 weather and oceanographic models are available with a yearly subscription (in-app purchase). Queries and downloads are fully customizable.\n\nThe application makes it possible to create your own geographical zones and to select the characteristics of the GRIB files to download: choice of data, resolution, periodicity, file size, etc. GRIB files can be downloaded wherever you are from our servers through a regular or satellite internet connection.\n\nWeather4D Routing displays the combined data as layered layers. All the data of a selected model is displayed by an animation in continuous time scrolling or in manual scrolling on the map.\n\nThe weather forecast is displayed in one or two windows (iPad only), offering several display combinations of the same area: navigation and weather, weather and waves or currents, comparison of different models. The two windows can be disassociated for displaying the same area at different scales.\n\nRouting\nWeather4D Routing makes it possible to optimize sailing or engine, or mixed sail-engine routes. From a theoretical route, a routing algorithm will take into account wind force and wave height constraints.  When sailing, the boat polar combined with wind and current forecasts will be used to optimize performance, comfort and safety.\n\nSeveral routes can be displayed to compare the outcome of different options: different forecast patterns, departure dates and times, selected constraint values. The routing can be restarted at any moment during  navigation from the actual position of the boat.\n\nDefault Models and Charts\n————————————\nGFS global forecast model at 0.25 °, 0.5 °, 1 ° and 2 ° resolutions. \nBING global chart\nOSM (Opens Street Map) global chart\n\nOptional Models (in-app purchase):\n———————————————————\nWeather\n--------\nNAM USA    \nGEM Global    \nCOAMPS Europe, West Atlantic, Central America, East Pacific    \nICON-EU Europe    \nARPEGE Global, Europe    \nAROME France, Antilles, Guyane, Polynésie, Calédonie, Indien  \nAROME HD France\nWRF France, Europe, Greece, NW Africa, Azores, Lesser Antilles, Greater Antilles    \n\nWaves\n-------\nMFWAM Global, Europe, France\nFNMOC WW3 Global, Europe\n\nCurrents\n---------\nMyOcean Global, IBI, NWS, Baltic, Med\nNCOM AMSEAS, USEAST, ALASKA, SOCAL, HAWAII"

If you already use the \"Barometer Plus - Altimeter\" app and purchased in-app, do not need to purchase this again.\n\nWe welcome your ideas and suggestions - please email us at: support+barometer@pvdapps.com.\nFollow our official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/barometerplus/ or Twitter account: https://twitter.com/pvdapps."

To achieve the best results consider the following:\n1)  Easy calibration (only the first time): click on the calibration button (for details read the user guide accessible from the calibration page)\n2) avoid measurement in presence of loud noises (heavy traffic, motorbikes, trucks, loud talking, shots)\n3) keep your fingers away from the microphone and keep it in a vertical position\n4) orient the front of the iphone in the direction of the wind without interfering with your body\n5) click on one of the function buttons (Dynamic, Average, Spectrum)\n6) A click on the PLAY button starts the measurement\n7) A click on the RESET button clears the current measurement\n8) HINT: for long observation periods (> 1s) read the AVG value, for medium observation periods (1s) use the Average mode, for short observation periods (gusts) use the Dynamic mode.\n\nThis application is not meant to be used in place of scientific instrumentation, but with a good calibration it can come close to a real anemometer device.\n\nRead the embedded User Guide (reachable from any setting button): for any info or troubleshooting you can contact us at support@gaiacons.com."

      "label": "************************************* \nFind all the photovoltaic data you need for your location. \n***********\nWhen you input coordinates manually, they have to be in decimal format. \nIf unsure, get coordinates from google maps. \n************\n\"This iPad and iPhone app is a comprehensive tool intended to help solar professionals calculate basically all aspects of a photovoltaic array. This includes weather information like clear sky days, hourly angle of the sun throughout the year and more.\n\nIt doesn’t stop there, though. The app generates information on the size of system you’ll need and how many panels would be in it. It also calculates what the size a battery backup would have to be for a proposed system. The app also includes a guide and a glossary where users can get more information.\n\nBasically, it’s like having a solar engineer at your fingertips.\" --cleanenergyauthority.com\n******\nThis is an application for professionals of the photovoltaic/solar panel industry. PV Master is essential to any person in the field who needs relevant information always available. \nWeather you’re a construction company/panel installer or serious DIY enthusiast this app will satisfy all your needs and requirements when it comes to setting up a green energy system. The sun is the future and with this app you can make it happen yourself. \n\nThe application is divided into 5 sections: \nData \nHere you have all the indeces you will ever need * explicitly for your current coordinates * (such as number of clear sky days, insolation incident, hourly solar angle relative to horizon, battery sizing and deficits, frequency of near-overcast skies, frost days average, average wind direction and speed, average monthly precipitation and pressure and much much more). \n\nGuide \nIf you’re a DIY look for home improvement or simply “getting started” in this field, here you will find a general guide with the necessary steps and considerations to be made when setting up a photovoltaic panel system. \n\nPannel Calc \nThe most frequently asked questions we face when looking into the feasability of sun as energy is “how many panels will I need?”. Thanks to this app the big question is easily answered. Gather the data from the first section and your current electricity bills, input the values and you’re done. Then it’s up to you to decide weather you wish to do it or not... \n\nBattery Calc \nIf you’re serious about going green then you definitely have to account for everything. The sun is always there but we all know there are many variables that might disrupt our “fuel”. For this reason we need to also account for batteries and surplus storage to evoid wasting potential energy and also not be “stuck” when during the colder season. Again, just gather data, insert it in the easy fields and you’re down. You know everything about kind, capacity and quantity of batteries you need. \n\nGlossary \nThis is another great section essential for any starter (although even experts will surely learn something form it). A collection of A-Z terms related to this this topic. You can jump to a certain letter if you wish to find something out otherwise just scrolling through it to educate yourself is a great way of spending time. \n\nAdditional Info \nOn startup, the app requests your location and fetches the specific data for the entire first section. This is on actual coordinates, not just state or city...pinpoint! \nEvery successful data fetch gets stored locally (no need to worry about privacy) so that if the next time you open the app there is no internet connection (perhaps you’re “on-site”) you will still have the everything available."

You can either watch live in HD ad free or get directions to the show.\n\nSet your alert level, Visible to the eye, Aurora moving slowly, or Sky's Alive.\n\nUnlike all other alert apps in existence, which rely on NOAA ‘space weather’ forecasts that requires experience to use, and is often old data, Live Aurora Network sends out real time alerts based on what is actually seen in the sky, we send alerts based on the visual detection of aurora from our Network of Cameras. currently in Iceland, Norway, Alaska, USA, Sweden\n\nOur unique algorithm not only detects the aurora borealis, but visually grades it based on the strength of the aurora. Users can choose the level they wish to be notified at so that they need only hit the road for displays they deem suitable.\n\nAll other top selling Aurora notification apps currently on the market are based on the global Kp index which runs from 0-9 and is based on magnetometers around the world. This is problematic for local aurora alerts, and not the most effective parameter for knowing when local auroral activity is highest.\n\nLive Aurora Network pushes out alerts in real time, thanks to software designed to detect the colours of the Aurora, while grading the density and percentage of the sky that is showing the lights. This is especially helpful to find breaks in the clouds!\n\nAlso, in this app:\n- HD live stream from every location\n- Zoomable map of Iceland, Norway, USA, Sweden, Alaska with directions to our dark sky areas.\n- Localized weather forecast at each location.\n- Current Live KP rating\n- Customisable alert level"

      "label": "What time is sunset today? Or sunrise tomorrow? When is the \"magic hour\" next March 20 in Paris? With Sol, you can check times and get reminders of solar events, at home or while traveling! Great for everyone looking to plan activities based on sunlight. Use it to remind you to walk the dog before dark, get up with the sun, or find golden hour time for that perfect photo.\n\nSol: Sun Clock is the Swiss-army knife of sunlight tools with a design inspired by the simplicity of the sundial. Use it to plan your day, guide natural sleep cycles, get the best light for outdoor photography, make sure animals or kids are safe inside before dark, or to map out the best times to go running or fishing. \n\n* Be in tune: Sol will tell you when the golden hour is, how much sunlight you have left in the day or what time the next sunrise occurs.\n\n* Look to the future, travel around the world: Sol lets you find sunlight information for any date, anywhere on earth. \n \n* Find solar midnight and solar noon, and all three twilight (dawn and dusk) periods: astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight. Keep tabs on the next solstice and equinox.\n \n* Reminders and Alarms: Use Sol as a natural alarm clock that you can set to any event (like sunset, golden hour or solar noon), and the alarm or reminder time will adjust gradually as the days change with the seasons.\n \n* Automatic Location: Sol not only calculates the amount of daylight and sunrise and sunset times, but does so for any location in the world (both Northern and Southern hemispheres) by using your device's GPS... no network connection required. \n\n* Other locations: Optionally, use the built-in map to choose any location in the world by moving the pin, or search using the name of any city.\n \n* Optional location-aware alarms. Sol knows when you change with your location; and as you travel it will adjust any alarms you set relative to sunrise and sunset times.  Create alarms for multiple locations around the world.\n\n* Detailed almanac information: Useful information about the day's length, sun's azimuth and elevation, equinoxes and solstices, and a friendly glossary that explains all the terms. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. However, GPS runs in the background ONLY if you have set location-aware alarms."

This app is for you! Easy and intuitive, it shows you the times of the golden and the blue hours.\n\nDo you have to plan your own photo session or a trip? You can change your GPS location and date within the app so you know exactly when the best time is for your photos.\n\nFeatures:\n - easy user interface\n - multiple locations management\n - event reminder by notifications\n - customizable notifications alert\n - no data connection required (weather excluded)\n - iOS 13+ dark mode support\n - weather forecasts\n - moon phases\n\nThe Golden hour, also known as magic hour corresponds to a special and sought after condition of natural sunlight with a high diffusion, warm temperature, low incidence and limited energy. In photography the golden hour translates into soft light, warm colors, shadows so long that they tend to disappear and a good level of contrast despite the reduced dynamics. Its opposite is the Blue hour that identifies a specific condition of the solar light characterized by a colder temperature and a low energy, which, in practical terms, results in subjects with numerous penumbra, de-saturated and colder colors and intense blue sky. The golden hour occurs when the sun is very low on the horizon and therefore in the moments after sunrise and before sunset, the blue hour instead at sunset or sunrise, in twilight situation, when the sun it's below the horizon. The time, duration and intensity of these \"magical hours\" change according to the seasons, latitudes and weather conditions and therefore this app will help you to identify them perfectly.\n\n2.8 - Feb 12, 2020\n- Following the suggestion of many users the use of gps is no longer mandatory and it is now possible to use the app without being automatic located.

When others view the location of the Pokemon locations you've marked, your trainer name will also be associated to aid your local trainer reputation. Everyone's gotta catch 'em all - so why not work together?\n\nAll Pokemon location submissions have the ability to be \"Upvoted\" or \"Downvoted\" by others. If a submission receives too many \"Downvotes\" it will be automatically removed from the map. Highly \"Upvoted\" locations will receive display priority on the map."

Why not try Xasteria - it is completely free with no ads - if you like it, you can support the service by getting Xasteria+ which comes with many extra features:\n\n-Dark Sky configurable hourly/hyperlocal world forecast.\n-Night-vision mode (choice of red/green/blue) with dimmer.\n-Lunar Calendar with Sun/Moon graphs and rise/set/twilight.\n-Location Manager with choice of location sources (online search, offline database, maps) and access to GPS accuracy/elevation and barometer data (for iPhones/iPads with barometer sensor).\n-Landscape display mode ability extends to iPhone/iPod.\n\nAs with Xasteria, you get a customizable world forecast from the ASTRO/7Timer service which provides:\n-Cloud cover.\n-Astronomical seeing.\n-Atmospheric transparency.\n-Temperature & Humidity.\n-Rain/Snow.\n-Atmospheric instability.\n-Wind Speed & Direction.\nThe Dark Sky forecast adds visibility & dew point.\n\nXasteria provides you with a choice of 3 visualization modes for the data: the new 7Timer! ASTRO graphics, the color-stripe graphics similar to some other astro-forecast services and a raw text mode.\n\nAdditional features:\n-Quick access to selected astro-weather web sources like Clear Outside, Meteoblue, Windy, Astrospheric, Sat24.com, the latest water vapor satellite images and animations, as well as the nearest Clear Sky Charts.\n-Light pollution report/maps for your location.\n-ISS and bright satellite passes for your location (data from heavens-above.com). \n\nXasteria is available in English, Greek and French. If you would like to translate it to your own language, please contact the author.\n\nI would appreciate a quick review on the App Store if you are using the app (there will be no popup asking you in the app as I hate those). If you have a specific request/suggestion you can also try the official app page at http://astro.ecuadors.net"

Do not hesitate to contact us and let us know your difficulties and suggestions!\n\n* Key Features *\n=> Forecasts in a Map: quickly get a glimpse of the weather across the island, by viewing the forecast icons overlaid onto a map. Use the zoom to view full resolution.\n=> All places: browse through a list of forecasts organized by locality. Besides icons representing the weather you may also view the predicted values for temperature, humidity and wind. Consult the legend for details on each icon.\n=> More details: access more detailed weather information in each locality.\n=> Favorites: want browse forecasts in a list of locations of your choice? Open sites individually and add them to your ‘Favorites’ list.\n=> Satellite images: use this option to view the satellite images from EUMETSAT-RGB, centered over Madeira Archipelago. Sequence of images usually hosts data for three consecutive days, with snapshots available several times a day.\n=> Time-navigation for up to three days, with hourly forecasts for all your favorite locations.

      "label": "WeatherFX is an app that is helpful to people who either work or play outdoors.\nFeatures:\n• Current International Weather Conditions\n• Up to 5 days of forecast data\n• Map with your location and closest weather station\n• Heat Flag Condition\n• Fluid Consumption and work Rest Ratios\n• Manual and Random Estimations\n• Spanish, French, Portuguese and Dutch Languages\n• Locale Support for time and measurements\n  \n  The app can provide guidance on work/rest ratios and fluid intake due to high temperatures. WeatherFX is an app that can retrieve temperature, barometric pressure and relative humidity based on the iPhone/iPad GPS data. The app will also approximate the wet bulb and wet bulb globe (WBGT) temperatures from the retrieved values. Please note that the WBGT is just an estimate. The estimate does not account for wind or low light conditions. The estimate is based on a moderate amount of sunlight. True WBGT can only be acquired through WBGT instrumentation. \n  Once you accept the prompt to acquire the GPS position, the Latitude and Longitude labels will be populated. Click the “Update” button and the app will populate the temperature, pressure and humidity text fields based the closest weather Station ID to your position. The app will then calculate the wet bulb and WBGT temperatures. You'll also notice that the WeatherFX app will place the location name and time of the reading at the top of the screen. This way you will know if the readings are in your location and timely. \n  Besides acquiring the weather from GPS you may get your own estimates for wet bulb and WBGT temperatures by typing temperature, pressure and humidity into the respective text fields. Click the “Manual” segmented button, enter the white fields followed by clicking the “Update” button. \n  The app will also compute random numbers for temperature, pressure and humidity clicking the \"Shake\" segmented button.  The device may be shaken and new settings will populate the fields.  Click update button and the random wet bulb and WBGT temperatures will be computed.  \nAfter an update has been executed, you may use WeatherFX to quickly convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa by clicking the desired “°F” or \"°C” segmented buttons. Barometric pressure may be converted from inches mercury to millibars and vice versa by clicking the desired “in” or “mBar” segmented buttons. \nAfter an update you will be presented with a flag condition button on the bottom left of the screen. The flag condition is derived from the WBGT estimate. If the flag condition is not “NONE”, you may click on the condition to yield work to rest ratios and water consumption given the current estimated flag condition. These figures are posted as a quick and portable reference only. Guidance for these figures are acquired from the U.S. Marine Corps Order 6200.1E dated June, 2002. You are strongly advised to read the complete guidance to know what each entry means."

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

      "label": "Simple and beautiful rustic style Thermometer now in your iPhone or iPad.\n\nWhat people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:\n\n- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Lite provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Lite is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. There are many settings for units and format of METAR/TAF available.\n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes basic airport data like sunrise/sunset, twilight times, timezones etc. \n\nAeroWeather Lite offers built-in groups for nearby stations, today widget (pre iOS 14), and earthquakes. Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view.\n\nMETAR alert notifications** is an helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with the following criteria: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility, and ceiling (BKN and OVC). Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when wind is greater/equal 10 kts, flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data comes primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. The pictures will be available to all other pilots (on the map or within an airport detail view) helping them to get a better idea about local conditions. AeroPix should be especially helpful when there's no or insufficient webcam coverage.\n\nThere's also an iMessage app included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. In order to keep AeroWeather Lite free we added a small ad banner at the bottom of the screen. Consider getting AeroWeather Pro, subscribe the additional features**, or remove the ad banner through one-time unlock* to have an ad-free app.\n\n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - METAR/TAF from ADS-B receiver thru GDL 90 protocol (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nWhen using AeroWeather Lite also the following features are enabled:\n - Remove ad banner\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

Never wonder when the sun will set or rise again!\n\nTracking the sun and moon is something people have done for thousands of years but it's never been easier than it is today with Sundial. Sundial puts solar and lunar information into the palm of your hand and, thanks to the Apple Watch app, onto your wrist as well!\n\nSundial is an app designed to give everyone access to the sun and moon in ways they don't normally have it. Perfect for runners, hikers, campers, boaters, sailors, pilots, gardeners, farmers, photographers, film/tv production crew, astronomers, astrophotographers, solar installers, and travelers of all kinds. Sundial is an app for anyone who just needs to know when it'll get light and dark.\n\nSundial provides a one-of-a-kind display of the sun and moon's rise and set cycle over the 24-hour day. As the seasons change, the yellow Òsun is outÓ arc informs you of the precious daylight hours, shrinking during winter months and expanding as summer approaches. The white inner arc represents when the moon is visible in the sky. Civil, nautical, and astronomical twilights are also shown on the solar dial in shades of blue.\n\nCreate alerts for one of 24 different solar and lunar events and Sundial will tell you about them Ð without you ever having to open the app.\n\nThe 24 events that support notifications include:\n\n- Sunrise, solar mid-morning, solar noon, solar mid-afternoon, sunset, and solar midnight\n- Civil twilight (dawn/dusk), nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight\n- Moonrise, lunar noon, moonset, and lunar midnight\n- Moon phases: full moon, new moon, first quarter moon, and last quarter moon\n- Astronomical seasons: March equinox, June solstice, September equinox, and December solstice\n\nAll notifications can be customized to alert you minutes, hours, and even days before an event takes place. Sundial can give you plenty of notice that you need to be ready for a sunrise, sunset, and more. Like to walk your dog for 30 minutes before dusk? Sundial can help you with that!\n\nThere's more, too!\n\nTIME TRAVEL\n\nUse Sundial's 24-hour wheel to see where the sun and moon will be today, tomorrow, and any other time you choose.

No fuss, no configuration, just quick weather readouts.\n \nWind Compass Features::\n•  Select Wind Speed reading by switching between Miles/hour or Kilometers/hour or Knots or Beaufort Wind Force or Meters Per Second\n• Select Compass Magnetic Declination from True North or Magnetic North\n• Select Temperature measurement from Fahrenheit or Celsius\n• Select the Arrow direction of the Wind Indicator from Blowing To or Coming From\n \nWeather Forecast Features:\n• Current Temperature as well as the Estimated Highs and Lows for that day\n• Sunrise/Sunset times as well as the \"First Light\" and \"Last light\" times for that day (Also known as Nautical Twilight Start and End)\n• 24 Hour Forecast as well as 7 Day Forecast showing: Time, Estimated Temperature, Estimated Wind Speed and Direction and % Chance of precipitation\n \nCustom Background Settings\nYou can also change the look of the app by selecting from the many different background types including standard colored backgrounds, as well as backgrounds like a map showing your current location, an overlay showing what your rear camera sees, and even a color gradient that auto adjusts from warm to cool based on the temperature of where you are!\n \nWind Compass uses the Forecast.io Weather data to provide accurate conditions where you are. Just open the app, let it update, and there you go. Forecast.io uses many sources and creates as accurate of a forecast as possible for your location.\n \nAs an added bonus, Wind Compass shows you which way is North so if you are inside or turned around, you can always know which way is north, along with the current wind direction.\n \nIf you have any issues with Wind Compass please email contact@maplemedia.io to quickly get the issue resolved. You can also submit a feature request or bug report right from inside the settings menu. \n \n*NOTE* Compass functionality within the app requires physical compass functionality built in. iPods can still get direction info but the compass will not update real time.\n \n*NOTE* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n \nCredits\n \nWind Icon designed by Jojo Franklin from J.Franklin Design (http://jfranklin.design).\n \nForecast Information Powered by Dark Sky https://darksky.net/poweredby/\n\nSubscription Terms: https://maplemedia.io/terms-of-service/\n\nSUPPORT: contact@maplemedia.io"

Weather Fit doesn’t just tell people the weather but answers the oh-so difficult question, ‘what to wear?’ And, the app does it in an engaging and fun way. \n\nCreatively informative. \nIt has a cute little character, who has the sense of style. The character dresses according to the weather. In such a way the app shows you what to wear now, today, tonight, and tomorrow. Also, if it’s sunny, the character will put on sunglasses; if it’s rainy — will take an umbrella; if the air isn’t clean enough — an anti-pollution mask. \n\nUniquely personalized experience.\nWhat’s even better is that the avatar is customizable. You can choose its sex, skin tone, haircut, color of hair and eyebrows, glasses, beard and its color. Make it look like yourself or a person you would like to see every day.\n\nImaginative and diverse.\nThere is a nice landscape behind the character, and it is used to display the current or future weather. The landscape changes according to weather conditions, time of day, and season. It’s both a weather forecast and art — beautiful and precise.   \n\nForecast that you can trust.\nWe use a reliable weather source, which implements a scientific approach to predicting weather and not a random numbers generator :)  \n\nIntuitive and slick user experience.\nThe interface is simple and straight to the point: hourly forecast, current conditions, and daily forecast at a glance. All you need to know is on the screen. \n\nA bunch of neat additional stuff: \n• Widget for quick access\n• Light and smooth dark themes\n• Warnings about naughty and dangerous weather \n• Air pollution levels \n\nAnd it’s all for free!\n\nWe have some paid content, but it’s dirty cheap and follows a monthly or yearly subscription model.\n \nA bundle of pleasantries: \n• No ads\n• Free 3-days trial\n• View the character directly in the widget \n\nEven more customization.\nClothes selection for a character so it better reflects the style that you prefer.\n \nAn epic set of a weather oracle. \nIf you are into detailed weather forecasts, we’ve got you covered! The app has weather maps and radar, which show the movement of air masses, clouds, and storms. Also, it has temperature, wind, humidity, and other maps. Basically, it has everything you need to feel like a weather oracle.  \n\nOur love and gratitude. \nYou help us grow, and it’s difficult to describe how much we appreciate it. \n\nNo more frustrating and mood-killing clothing considerations, no more raw, boring data. Get the app, shoot a glance at the screen, and go on with enjoying your days in comfy clothes without getting cold, hot, or wet. \n\nTry it for yourself. \n\n---\n\nSubscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.\n \nTerms of Use: https://weatherfit.com/terms-and-conditions.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://weatherfit.com/privacy-policy.html"

Knowing when sun protection is recommended wherever you are in the world gives you confidence to enjoy the sun safely, minimizing the risk of skin damage which can lead to cancer. \n\nThe SunSmart Global UV app takes the guesswork out of being safe in the sun with daily sun protection times sent to your phone along with simple advice for protecting your skin.\n\n***What are sun protection times?***\nSun protection times are linked to the UV Index and are advised when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above. This is consistent with the WHO UV Index guidance and has been determined as the level at which damage to the skin is likely to occur more quickly.\n\nThe app will advise you that sun protection is required during specific times when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above so that you can adequately protect your skin.\n\n***How is it different to other UV apps?***\nThe UV app has the backing of world-leading health and meteorological organisations making it a trusted and reliable source of advice.\n\nUnlike other apps, the SunSmart Global UV app is designed to simply inform users when sun protection is required and when it is not. \n\n***What are the key features?***\n- Daily UV levels for the local area including sun protection times\n- 5-day forecast including UV and weather forecast\n- Access to the forecast UV and sun protection times anywhere in the world"

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "VOR Tracker is a small but powerful training tool for pilots. It is the only one of its kind for the iPhone & iPad, providing the real aircraft feel the other apps are missing!\n\nVOR Tracker is a real IFR simulation, so you will find no multiple choice questions or yet more methods which might or might not work for you. \n\nYou can actually practice IFR procedures in real time, using either a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI, which provides additional information like wind, track, and groundspeed. \n\nPractice holding patterns, DME arcs, radial interceptions, and 2 needle tracking in real time. It is practice what it is all about! There is no need for explaining again and again what you already know from flight school. It is about applying your knowledge when the flight instruments start moving!\n\nWherever you are, IFR training is only two taps away!\n\nChose between a VOR and NDB and get used to the different characteristics. The NDB comes with atmospheric disturbances and an adjustable dip error to match the instrument you are used to.\n\nDon’t waste your time trying to imagine what you would do in the aircraft – just do it!\n\nVOR Tracker is designed for:\n\n- Student pilots who have the theoretical knowledge for flying IFR procedures, and want to save money by preparing for their pilot training.\n\n- Pilots who want to refresh their IFR navigation skills for an upcoming check ride.\n\n- Pilots going for an assessment. Holding patterns and radial interceptions are commonly used during sim assessments and can really spoil the day. Being prepared will make the difference!\n\n- People who have the knowledge of flying IFR procedures and want to give it a try.\n\n\nVOR Tracker is NOT:\n\n- a game.\n\n- a flight simulator, it focuses on navigation at a constant speed and altitude.\n\n- a flight training course teaching you how to fly IFR procedures.\n\n\nStill interested? Read on to find out how VOR Tracker will boost your skills in no time!\n\n- Choose between a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI.\n\n- Use the instruments like you would do in the real aircraft.\n\n- Use the map mode to verify your progress.\n\n- Lost? Use the help function to display the holding pattern entries in the map mode.\n\n- Things are going a bit too fast? Use the freeze mode to orientate.\n\n- Getting bored in straight flight? Use the fast mode.\n\n- You want to start over or change the aircraft’s position or heading? Just drag & drop, or twist the aircraft symbol.\n\n- Practice a particular holding pattern or radial interception exercise over and over again from new, random starting positions using the reposition button.\n\n- Start with no wind and increase the difficulty later on by adding wind.\n\n- To add more realism, the wind can be selected to be gusty and/or variable in direction.\n\n- Getting settled? Why not increase the aircraft’s speed in the settings menu?\n\n- Customize your own missions and adjust the wind the way you want.\n\n- Use the hidden wind function to add a realistic challenge.\n\n- Analyze your progress in the map mode. Rewind and start over. The previous track lines will still be displayed for you to see the difference.\n\nPrepare yourself without wasting expensive flight time – use VOR Tracker to brush up your IFR skills!\n\nVOR Tracker is the most efficient trainer for holding patterns and radial interceptions available on the App Store.\n\nSupporting you during your IFR training, it will pay for itself in no time. Take that as a promise!"

Your children can then use the coins to unlock other cute characters.\nA motivating math app that has your children solving hundreds of math tasks in just minutes. Efficient math practice for grade school!\n\nLearning principle: how children have fun learning math\nOur tests have shown children voluntarily solving hundreds of tasks in a short time. On paper, that would be almost impossible.\n\nThe game principle is easy to understand: For every correctly solved task, the player jumps one step up the stairs. If the answer is wrong, they jump down one level.\nEach task solved is rewarded with a coin. But some tasks offer bonuses.\nYour children can then use the coins to unlock other characters.\n\nThe direct feedback and the proven reward system motivates the children to keep solving tasks.\nOur goal with Fiete Math Climber is for children to do arithmetic voluntarily because it's fun and they can see their progress.\n\nBehind the scenes, the app analyzes the child's task-solving style and continuously adjusts the difficulty.\nBy gently increasing the challenge, their motivation increases and they gain self-confidence in solving math tasks.\n\nNevertheless, it is always up to the children to decide how difficult they want the tasks to be: they can skip tasks they find too difficult, simplify them, or even make them harder.\nThis freedom keeps their motivation high and ensures that your child will have fun with this math app for a long time.\n\nHelps parents and teachers to identify and resolve issues\nThe app continuously analyzes the child's arithmetic and reveals the child's skills and potential issues with certain tasks. \nThe analytics algorithm immediately identifies issues and creates targeted sets of tasks.\nThe perfect add-on for math class.\n\nThe task list shows parents and teachers what tasks the child has tackled. \nThis makes it possible to see how far the child's skills have come and why they have issues with certain tasks. It will also parents and teachers to help address these issues.\n\nUser management allows multiple students to use the app at the same time.Extensive statistics provide information on whether a child is really improving.\n\n\nFeatures\n- Contains all arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n- Number range adjustable from 1 to 1,000\n- Pre-configured exercise sets include: arithmetic up to 20, multiplication tables, carrying tens, etc.\n- suitable for children ages 5 to 10\n- targeted training possible\n- task definition is comprehensively adjustable\n- motivation through entertaining game structure with direct feedback\n- long-term motivation through the possibility of collecting figures \n- user management\n - multiple players possible\n- statistics show learning progress\n- display all tasks solved\n- skills analysis\n- identify skills and potential issues\n- secure\n- all data remains on the device\n\n\nSUPPORT INFORMATION\nWe do our best to test our apps on all devices.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Welcome to Toca Life: Pets, where you and your animal friends run the show! What’s your favorite pet like? Furry and fast? Wet and wiggly? A little bit creepy? With more than 120 animals, Toca Life: Pets has every kind of pet you can imagine.\n\nEXPLORE FIVE LOCATIONS\n\nPET PARK: Enjoy the great outdoors with the pets! Take a dip in the river, have a picnic on the grass, play a game or discover a hidden cave. Or build an agility course to train your pets and test their skills. Poke around a bit, explore the tree — you might find some surprises to expand your pet family!\n\nPET HOTEL: Sometimes families go on trips without their pets, but thanks to the pet hotel, pets get a vacation of their own! With lots of cozy spaces, an aquarium and outdoor space, every pet will find a nice spot to play or relax — dog or cat, bird or sloth-bat!\n\nVETERINARY: The vet can help sick pets feel better and help healthy pets stay that way! You’ll find pills, drops and the instruments needed to operate on sick or injured pets. Pets can play outdoors or wait on the cozy beds until the vet is ready to see them.\n\nPET SHOP: Find everything you need for to groom, feed, play with and care for your pets at the pet shop. After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice and your characters’ movements as you’re telling the story. Create videos up to two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share your storytelling later! \n\nAbout Us:\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

There are a number of intravenous drugs that come with the application but you can also access a central database and download other drug records for off-line use. Interaction between Propofol and opioids is implemented. An exceptional feature is the IVassist mode that will calculate a manual dosing scheme  to obtain  and change a target blood or effect site concentration with adjustable precision. This will allow to show an example of a TCI like  administration of drugs and Pk models that are not yet available in TCI systems and evaluate that model. Simulation data can be exported to your favourite spreadsheet for later analysis."

Put what you want to move into the transport, close the door and select the new location by tapping an icon. Everything will arrive in the selected location so you can begin your next adventure!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video!

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation. Turn into an astronomer and explore planets, moons, satellites, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, stars and other celestial bodies. Enjoy gorgeous graphics and visuals while navigating through the solar system!\n\n► Make virtual flights from one space object to another.\n\n► Travel in time and see what the universe and our Solar system looked like at a certain period.\n\n► Find an exciting view of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n► Watch a collection of educational solar system movies to learn about space-related topics including Earth's moon phases, Earth's cycles, tidal phenomena, and zodiacal constellations.*\n\n► Enjoy 3D planetarium with the help of special glasses and activating the anaglyph mode.\n\n► Share interesting screenshots of the app with your friends.\n\n► Choose the view mode comfortable for you (orrery/true-to-scale).\n\n*Available through In-App Purchases.\n\nSolar Walk is a great educational tool appropriate for both adults and children. The amount of information users can learn about the planets, moons, satellites and other celestial bodies is impressive.

Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

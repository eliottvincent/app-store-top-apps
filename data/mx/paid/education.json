      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

He just catches old boots. \n\nFEATURES:\n*More than 7 locations to explore, both in the water and out\n*New characters to play with \n*Over 200 items to interact with\n\nRECOMMENDED AGE GROUP\nKids 4-12: My Town games are safe to play even when parents are out of the room. \n\nTELL US WHAT YOU THINK!\n You can easily contact with us on Facebook or Twitter at any time to let us know what you would like changed or added.

After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day.

      "label": "Experiment with plant characters, evolve them into new species and discover their unique personalities. Keep collecting plants until you’ve collected them all! The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

This app will turn your English text into its phonetic transcription using International Phonetic Alphabet.\n \nFeatures:\n \n- See phonetic transcription of the whole text, not just the dictionary forms of separate words.\n- Choose between British and American* pronunciation. When British dialect is selected the [r] sound at the end of the word is only voiced if followed by a vowel, which follows British phonetic convention.\n- International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols used.\n- The structure of the text and sentences in it (line breaks, punctuation marks, etc.) is preserved in phonetic transcription output making it easier to read.\n- You can output the text and its phonetic transcription along each other line-by-line to make back-reference to the original text easier.\n- An option to vary pronunciation depending on whether words are in stressed or weak position in the sentence, as in connected speech.\n- In addition to commonly used vocabulary the database contains a very substantial amount of place names (including names of countries, their capitals, US states, UK counties), nationalities and popular names.\n- Where a word has a number of possible pronunciations (highlighted in blue in the output) you can select the one that agrees with the context by tapping on it.\n- Print out the output results, share via email or copy to pasteboard.\n- Let the built-in speech synthesiser read your text out loud. Control the playback and follow IPA transcription of the current word with a highlight.\n- Custom URL scheme to open toPhonetics from 3rd-party apps.\n\nGestures (IPA transcription screen):\n1. Single tap\n    - Tap a word to set the cursor to it and speak it (you can mute/un-mute it with the button at your bottom-right).\n    - Tap in a blank space to stop speech and hide the cursor.\n2. Double-tap\n    - Double-tap a word to open it in the built-in dictionary; if the word has multiple pronunciations you'll see the list of them first.\n    - Double-tap in a blank space to reset the font to the size set in iOS preferences.\n3. Pinch in or out to make the text smaller or larger.\n4. Start to slide horizontally to select a part of your text.

Images have been included to aid the placement of the magnets using a human anatomical-topographical point of reference system. In addition, there are notes and specific recommendations that all Biomagnetists should follow when scanning. Top 10, Top 5 and protocols by diseases lists have been updated. The information contained in this guide will help the practitioner better comprehend BMPs and will allow an improved implementation of the Biomagnetic Pair technique."

His genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination\".He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived.According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and \"his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote\". Marco Rosci states that while there is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.\n\n******************\n1、100 pieces of works\n\n******************\n2、All HD, 1M per piece\n\n******************\n3、Totally more than 100M"

      "label": "NoteWorks is a musical game, designed to teach note recognition and improve sight reading skills. Hungry Munchy is eager to swallow elusive blue notes. Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

Teachers, parents, and children have participated in the development of the app. Together with the possibilities of modern technology, this app is has become a success.\n\nThe aesthetically pleasing design of the abacus can communicate in ​​German, English, Spanish, Dutch, and French. The voices are native speakers with experience in this area.\n\nWith the different levels of difficulty, your child can begin to use this computational framework as early as preschool. Bills up 10, 20, 100, 1000 or 99,999 plus or minus are selectable.\n\nThe abacus has four rows of ten beads:\nThe blue row represents the ONES\nThe red row represents the TENS\nThe green row represents the HUNDREDS The yellow row represents the THOUSANDS\n\nThere are four abacus variants:\nAbacus 1: An abacus for free arithmetic. Here, your child can move the beads and use the rows as he or she likes.\n\nAbacus 2: An abacus for calculation with free display that shows the numbers of displaced beads. Sorted by colors, the numbers are accurately represented in tens, hundreds, and thousands. This way, your child learns the THZE system.\n\nAbacus 3: An abacus with addition tasks. by correctly moving the real pearls, you can solve the tasks. Here your child will have fun completing the tasks. With the pearls, completing the tasks becomes a game. \n\nAbacus 4: An abacus with subtraction tasks. By correctly moving the real pearls, you can solve the tasks. Here your child will have fun completing the tasks. With the pearls, completing the tasks becomes a game. \n\nSetting options:\n- Language (English, German , Spanish , Dutch, French) \n- Voice on or off\n- Sound on or off\n- Difficulty :\nLevel 1: Calculations up to 10\nLevel 2: Calculations up to 20\nLevel 3: Calculations from 20-100\nLevel 4: Calculations from 100-1000\nLevel 5: Calculations from 1000-99999\nLevel 6: Calculations from 1-99999\n- Statistics ( Here all results are recorded )"

      "label": "Me llamo Samuel. Si has llegado hasta aquí, puede ser por casualidad o curiosidad. Pero, lo lógico, es que sea porque tengas PROBLEMAS con FORMULACIÓN QUÍMICA y NOMENCLATURA QUÍMICA (formulación inorgánica).\n\nEs normal, se le suele \"atragantar\" a la mayoría de personas que he conocido. Para eso estoy aquí, para AYUDARTE.\n\nPor eso te pido que dediques ahora unos segundos a leer lo que comento a continuación.\n\nEn 2013 publiqué la primera versión de YoFormulo. Tras varios cientos de miles de descargas en todas sus modalidades, y siendo la aplicación de formulación química más descargada del mundo en español, decidí en 2019 que era momento de actualizarla y mejorarla.\n\nCon mi BASE de DATOS, podrás buscar compuestos por NOMBRE o FÓRMULA, ideal para hacer ejercicios de clase de una forma RÁPIDA y SIN ERRORES (no hay ninguna aplicación en el mercado que haga lo mismo, o yo no la he encontrado aún). Sé que algunos usáis esta parte para COPIAR en los EXÁMENES, pero no es lo aconsejable, si quieres aprender.\n\nUno de los \"defectos\" de la versión anterior era que necesitabas datos o conexión Wi-Fi para acceder a la base de datos. En esta versión, NO hace falta CONEXIÓN.\n\nSi quieres aprender, tengo una serie de JUEGOS de ENTRENAMIENTO que te ayudarán. Son juegos de preguntas y respuestas, adaptados para aprender nombres y símbolos de elementos, valencias y nombres y fórmulas de compuestos. ¿Te atreves con ellos?\n\nA modo de consulta, también ofrezco una TABLA PERIÓDICA, con los símbolos, nombres, números atómicos, masas atómicas y VALENCIAS de todos los elementos, así como la posibilidad de acceder a un curso de formulación química.\n\nSi eres de los que no pagan por apps o te parece excesivo el precio, piensa en lo siguiente. El desarrollo y mantenimiento de una aplicación, web, servidores, publicidad, etc., tienen una serie de costes, que hay que afrontar. Si has ido recientemente al cine, y has visto una película que no te ha gustado, seguramente te habrá costado más dinero. Es una forma de fomentar la creación de herramientas de calidad, que NO te inundarán de PUBLICIDAD. En el sector tecnológico dicen que “CUANDO UN PRODUCTO ES GRATIS, TÚ ERES EL PRODUCTO”. Significa que usarán tus datos para usarlos con fines publicitarios, estudios de mercado, etc.\n\n¡DESCARGA AHORA YoFormulo!\n\n¿Necesitas más para aprender o no te convenzo? \n\nVisita mi web www.yoformulo.com.\n\nEspero haberte ayudado.\n\nUn saludo,\n\nSamuel de YoFormulo"

      "label": "My Day with WH words includes a social story about talking about one’s day, and a simple visual support that asks different “WH” questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How). The story focuses on why it’s important to tell people about your day and on what each different WH question means.\n\n**********\n\nThe app opens up to a menu that allows the user to choose between going to the story, or to the simple WH question support tool. The tool asks Who, What, When, Where, Why and How questions. The social story describes why it’s good to talk about your day, and what kind of questions people may ask about your day. \n\n“Who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why,” and “how” are some of the most important words in our language. From early childhood these words form the building blocks of personal interactions and conversations.\n\nTypical children usually develop an understanding of these questions without direct instruction from adults. This makes it is easy to forget that this may not be the case for everyone. Certain individuals, particularly those with a communication delay as someone diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, may need more direct instruction in learning to understand question forms and in learning to use these skills to become better partners in daily interaction.\n\nBased on a study sponsored by the Indiana Resource Center for Autism (IRCA), it is recommended that most verbal students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who are four years of age and older be screened for WH question comprehension.\n\nA common error for people with ASD is something called a mismatch. This means that they will answer a question as if a different question had been asked. For example, the student answer a Who question as if a What, Where, or When question had been asked.\n\nA visual support may be used to enhance instruction and to assist in WH question comprehension to prevent such “mismatches.” \n\nThe WH Question visual support can be used in several ways. First of all any person asking a WH question of the child can point to it as they ask questions. The graphic represents a visual support for the orally asked question. When the buttons themselves are tapped different questions are asked so that the user may practice answering. \n\nInstruction in answering WH questions is common in classrooms, which may make the visuals more meaningful to the student. \n\nQuestion comprehension is important and a simple visual support might be an important tool to use to aid the student’s progress.\n\nTeaching conversational skills to any child may be easier and less stressful when visual supports, like social stories are used. \n\nSocial stories are an important type of visual support often used with children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome or other special need. This social story uses simple text and descriptive pictures to explain WH questions.\n\nSocial stories were first defined by Carol Gray in 1991 and are commonly used to break down a task or social situation into small and easy to understand steps, often accompanied by descriptive pictures. Social stories are easy to implement and are used by many professionals for a wide range of behaviors and skills."

This frees up time for you to enjoy the most rewarding and important parts of your job - building connections and making a difference.\n\nWHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING ABOUT BEHAVIORSNAP?\n\n“Let me be the first to say that this is the tool I’ve been waiting for. As a school psychologist this app has already helped me collect valuable data on student behavior. The charts are perfect, the user interface is easy and intuitive, and the design is sleek and modern.” - Eric W., School Psychologist\n\n“BehaviorSnap gives a great framework for what types of observations we should be doing. It’s more scientific and much easier than how we have been conducting observations. We are now spending more time doing our jobs than managing our materials.” -  Matt G., School Psychologist\n\n“Going from doing pencil and paper observations to using this tool is like the difference between a dinosaur and a space rocket! This app has really helped me!  It makes taking behavior data so much easier-- it’s well worth the cost.” - Rose D., Special Education Teacher\n\nIf you are drowning in paperwork and responsibilities, BehaviorSnap will help you win back your time.\n\nFOR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS, BY SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS\n\nWe are school psychologists ourselves and deal with all the same challenges you do.  Systematic behavior observations are crucial but compiling the data with spreadsheets, so we could share the data in a presentable manner, sapped our attention from what we really wanted to be doing. We were sure there was a better way.\n\nWe created templates and put them in a simple to use app. With the press of a button, you can start a behavior observation and just as quickly collect and present data.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Four separate observation tools in one to allow you to do Interval, ABC, Duration, and Frequency recordings.\n\n- Customizable to meet the needs of individual students.\n\n- Your input is saved for each student to ensure efficient and consistent data tracking. \n\n- Data from each observation is compiled into meaningful and easy to read graphs.\n\n- Reports can easily be emailed, printed, or attached to IEPs. \n\nIn no time time you'll have beautifully presented data. You'll feel more in control, more productive, and more secure in your job. And, you will open up time to work directly with kids which will give you greater overall satisfaction.  \n\n++\n\nDownload and gain access to an initial 12 observations and opportunity to tour the basic functionality of the top behavior observation tool on the market. If you love the app as much as we know you will, you will then have the option to choose a subscription that grants you unlimited use and access to exclusive features. Whether or not you choose to subscribe, you will always be able to view all of your observations and reports - the data you created will remain in your hands.\n\nDon't waste another day frustrated by inferior methods of conducting observations. Retire your hand drawn templates and stopwatches. You owe it to yourself to try the method that will allow you to organize data at the tap of a screen.   \n\nMORE INFO ONLINE\n\nOn the fence? Screencasts, tutorials and more are available at behaviorsnap.com\n\nIf you choose to purchase a subscription, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase. Current price for one year is $29.99/yr USD, and may vary from country to country.

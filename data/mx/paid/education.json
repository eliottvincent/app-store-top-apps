      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

      "label": "Winner of the 2018 Children's BAFTA for best Interactive\n\n* As seen on Nick Jr.*\n\nNumbers made fun, with Hey Duggee’s first educational app: The Counting Badge. \n\nSafe ad-free content for your little ones. \n\nThe Counting Badge has been designed with Early Years Foundation Stage learning outcomes at its core. Featuring a diverse mix of engaging counting tasks, with automatically adjusting difficulty levels, the game caters for Duggee fans of all ages. \n\nStart by remembering which day of the week it is and picking what the weather looks like outside -   then move swiftly on to some Early Years brain training! There are nine counting tasks to practice, each with four variations. That's 36 different activities to keep content fresh, while three levels of difficulty ensure that little minds will stay entertained and engaged for longer.\n\n• Tap tadpoles one-by-one, counting up as you go. Keep practising with bubbles, apples and ducks. \n• Pick which of the two groups of spiders matches the number shown on screen. Have another go with the frogs, worms or snails.\n• Count bees as you catch them and place them back in their hive. You'll also need to round up the cows, the chickens and the crows. \n• Put the snakes in order, from smallest to biggest. Practice makes perfect, so keep trying with some socks, totem poles and test tubes.\n• Sort the toucans from the flamingos by placing them in the correct paddling pool. There's plenty more sorting to do with bugs, pizza toppings and clubhouse toys. \n• Count the alligators every time they raise their heads above the water. See if you can perfect your reaction times with rabbits, monkeys and mice. \n• Decide whether there are more tulips or daisies in the field of flowers. Keep working out ‘which is more,’ with bugs, balloons and Jazz Fish.\n• Identify the number that shows how many ants are holding up the hotdog. You'll also need to choose the correct number of penguins, rabbits and birds.\n• And finally, as an early introduction to adding up, work out how many penguins are missing from the iceberg. You’ll need to do some more sums by deciding on the missing number of sandwiches, bananas and birds.\n\nPlaying through five activities will earn the player a Gold Star and every fourth star will see Duggee award them their Counting Badge. Profiles for up to three players can be saved, allowing your little ones to pick up exactly where they left off each time they return to the app. \n\nSo what are you waiting for? Let’s get counting!\n\nKey Features: \n• Counting tasks chosen based on Early Years numeracy learning objectives\n• Designed to cover the varying abilities of the 2 to 6 year old range. \n• Encourages player recognition of days of the week, dates in the month and the weather outside. \n• 36 counting screens keep content fresh and maximise the duration of engagement (9x mechanics each with 4x variations) \n• Stored player profiles regulate difficulty progression for each counting mechanic (3x difficulty levels)\n• Gold star collection mechanic plus daily award of the Counting Badge encourages repeat plays\n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

Crazy Gears is a new-aged digital puzzle game, designed with a real mechanical engine and with children's critical thinking skills in mind! Hours of fun guaranteed for everyone who is up for the challenge, yes, even you Mom & Dad!\n\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2015 ***\n*** Parent's Choice Gold Winner Fall 2015***\n*** App of the week by Fun2Tap ***\n*** Best of the Best by Best Apps For Kids ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n\n\nABOUT CRAZY GEARS\nExplore a captivating digital playground in this tantalizing puzzle game! Children manipulate gears, chains, rods, and pulleys, to pull themselves through each level, which teaches them how different mechanisms affect one another when constructing a machine. Each reasoning challenge was carefully designed to adhere to the theories of educational technology pioneer, mathematician, computer scientist, and designer of the first programming language for children, Seymour Papert.\n\n“The best use of games is to leverage their tendency to enhance learning”- Papert\nRecommended Ages 5-9 \n\nAs a child, Papert fell in love with gears. Their movement fascinated him in every way and inspired his career. Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

Beware – similar apps require internet connectivity.\n\nRussian Alphabet contains two in-app purchases, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The practice feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n\n• The quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Russian Alphabet in no time!"

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

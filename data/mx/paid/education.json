Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Pilots will find this App an indispensable tool in both planning for what to expect during the ATP airplane checkride, and mastering the subject matter. Instructors rate them as excellent preparation for students, as well as preps for airman checks and interviews.\n\nThis Airline Transport Pilot Checkride app is based on the popular Airline Transport Pilot Oral Exam Guide book by Michael Hayes. It is designed for pilots training for the ATP certificate. More than 1,000 questions and responses ensure all the subjects an Airline Transport Pilot candidate will be tested on during checkrides, airman checks, and interviews are covered. Topics include: operation of systems, performance and limitations, weather information, high altitude aerodynamics, air carrier operations, human factors, and the code of federal regulations. Answers and explanations were researched using FAA documents (which are identified so pilots know where to go for further study) as well as interviewing FAA examiners.\n\nCompatible with iOS phones and tablets, this app teaches applicants not only what to expect, but also how to exhibit subject mastery and confidence when under the examiner’s scrutiny. It identifies candidates’ strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in their aeronautical knowledge, which increases study efficiency. App features:\n• More than 1,000 questions most frequently asked during an Airline Transport Pilot Airplane checkride are included with succinct, ready responses.\n• Ability to Mark questions from any subject to review collectively as a custom study session\n• Includes all the questions and answers from the popular book, Airline Transport Pilot Oral Exam Guide by Michael Hayes.\n• Brought to you by a trusted resource in aviation training and publishing, Aviation Supplies & Academics (ASA)."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

Mnemonica, Aronoson, Sti-stebbins) \n\n‘Practice P.A.O’ \n\nOur method for learning the stack uses the unique P.A.O Method (person, action, object.) \n\nYou will be able to enter your own custom values and practice them within the app! \n\nIn order to protect the integrity of our methods we won’t go any deeper into that here, but you will be able to practice P.A.O within the app. \n\n‘Practice the Stack’\n\nThis is where you’ll spend most of your time.\n\nIn the ‘practice the stack’ part of the app there are a lot of settings you can play around with! \n\nYou can practice any part of the stack e.g. 1-10, 5-25, or 1-52 (anything you choose!) \n\nYou can also practice based on suits, odd cards, even cards, red or black cards and more! \n\nYou can also set your own rules for the training deciding whether you want to be timed, lose lives, or practice in free play mode. \n\nYour custom stacks also automatically sync with this part of the app. \n\nEach day you practice you’ll update your streak - get to thirty days and we’ll send you something special! \n\nThis app is constantly being worked on to make it the best app in the magic industry regarding stack training - you won’t be disappointed. \n\nBuy now!"

      "label": "● IELTS Collocation: Learning collocations are highly recommended\n- Some of the most important vocabulary needed for IELTS writing are collocations. These are essential when expanding your vocabulary. Basically, collocations are 2 or 3 words that commonly go together and sound just right to a native speaker. For some tips on building your vocabulary take a look at this application. \n- If you do not know how to use collocations then they will sound or look ‘wrong’ to a native speaker .\n\n● Why are collocations so important?\n- In the marking criteria in IELTS, you are marked on Lexical Resource (vocabulary). You will be marked on the way you use collocations in the writing section, mainly essays. Here is what it says in the Public Band Descriptors about Writing task 2 Band 7\n- Not only are collocations in IELTS important for writing, but they are useful in the speaking test also. They give your speech a smooth natural flow, which if used well, can help you get a Band 7 or more in the speaking test. You have to know how to use them correctly though.\n\n● How do I learn collocations?\n- When you learn new words you must learn the surrounding words or the matching words that help it collocate. Do not just memorise words on their own. Collocations are like chunks of language and there are various patterns to these.\n\n- The best way to learn collocations is through reading, listening and making your own sentences. I advise making a vocabulary book where you write out example sentences. I do not advise making word lists because you must know how collocations work in the surrounding sentence. These also have to be reviewed regularly and put into practice.\n\n● There are quite a few patterns such as:\n- Verb + Noun\n- Verb + Adverb\n- Adjective + Noun\n- Adverb + Adjective\n- Noun + Noun\n- Collocations with ‘have’ or ‘take’\n\nThe app is free and support OFFLINE. It'll perfect for English learner."

These are the fundamental topics in learning German, which require memorization by heart.\n\nThe app is intended for both beginners and advanced. The learning of prepositions and gender in German requires time to memorize and develop a kind of reflex in memory, which is often only partially available even for people who have been learning the language for a long time. With constant practice of prepositions and gender, you will build sentences faster and your German will be more fluent.\n\nIn the app, you will also find the most important rules and tips you need, for example, how to build sentences correctly or how to decline adjectives.\n\nIn addition, the application has a motivation system and statistics. After completing each category, you can get the corresponding trophies.\n\nTrain your German effectively!"

      "label": "Learn Kotlin Programming for Beginner to Advanced Developer. Master Kotlin Programming and Become a Kotlin Ninja. This is an in depth training to the awesome new programming Language Kotlin, So if you are already a Java developer and thinking of switching to Kotlin for development or you just want to learn this awesome language to increase you skills.\nThis App is going to be your best friend. This app contains all the major topics of Kotlin Programming Language with Code Examples. With its beautiful UI and easy to learn guide you can learn the Kotlin Programming in few Days, and this is what make this app different from other apps. We are constantly updating this app with every new major Kotlin language release and adding more code snippets. \n\nTopics Included in this App:\n- Introduction to Kotlin Programming\n- Kotlin Installation and Environment Setup\n- Learn Kotlin Variables\n- Learn Constants\n- Learn Types\n- Learn Conditional in Kotlin\n- Learn Function\n- Learn about Numbers\n- Learn Strings\n- Learn Null Safety\n- Learn About Exception Handling in Kotlin Language\n- Lambda Expressions\n- Lists and Sets\n- Workin with Maps\n- Functional Programming Basics\n- Scope Functions\n- Learn Classes\n- Class Initialization\n- Inheritance\n- Objects, Data Classes, and Enums\n- Interfaces and Abstract Classes\n- Kotlin Generics\n- Extensions\n- Learn how to work with Coroutines with Kotlin\n- Using Kotlin for Web\n- Kotlin Mircroservices and much much more\n\n\nFew more Reasons to Learn Kotlin Programming Language\n\n1. Kotlin experience is in demand:\n\n2. You’ll develop projects faster:\nKotlin requires fewer lines of code to do the same things as other programming languages. It is an inherently concise language, so can solve many common development problems with just a few lines of code. \n\n3. You’ll improve the quality of the apps you build:\n\nKotlin improves the quality of your released apps through “safety” features that have been designed to reduce the number of bugs and system failures. For example, it has a strong type system based on null-safety. This means by default, variables can’t be null, so you can catch more errors at compile-time before shipping to users. \n\n4. You can use it with existing Java libraries:\n\nKotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, so apps you’ve already built can be migrated to Kotlin incrementally. You don’t need to stop using Java—you can use both! Extension functions give you a way to add functionality to existing classes (even Java classes) without a full rewrite to Kotlin. This means you can take advantage of Kotlin’s powerful features without having to abandon all the skills you’ve gained while building existing apps.\n\nSo if you Like our effort rate this app or comment below if you want to give us any suggestions or ideas.

      "label": "Me llamo Samuel. Si has llegado hasta aquí, puede ser por casualidad o curiosidad. Pero, lo lógico, es que sea porque tengas PROBLEMAS con FORMULACIÓN QUÍMICA y NOMENCLATURA QUÍMICA (formulación inorgánica).\n\nEs normal, se le suele \"atragantar\" a la mayoría de personas que he conocido. Para eso estoy aquí, para AYUDARTE.\n\nPor eso te pido que dediques ahora unos segundos a leer lo que comento a continuación.\n\nEn 2013 publiqué la primera versión de YoFormulo. Tras varios cientos de miles de descargas en todas sus modalidades, y siendo la aplicación de formulación química más descargada del mundo en español, decidí en 2019 que era momento de actualizarla y mejorarla.\n\nCon mi BASE de DATOS, podrás buscar compuestos por NOMBRE o FÓRMULA, ideal para hacer ejercicios de clase de una forma RÁPIDA y SIN ERRORES (no hay ninguna aplicación en el mercado que haga lo mismo, o yo no la he encontrado aún). Sé que algunos usáis esta parte para COPIAR en los EXÁMENES, pero no es lo aconsejable, si quieres aprender.\n\nUno de los \"defectos\" de la versión anterior era que necesitabas datos o conexión Wi-Fi para acceder a la base de datos. En esta versión, NO hace falta CONEXIÓN.\n\nSi quieres aprender, tengo una serie de JUEGOS de ENTRENAMIENTO que te ayudarán. Son juegos de preguntas y respuestas, adaptados para aprender nombres y símbolos de elementos, valencias y nombres y fórmulas de compuestos. ¿Te atreves con ellos?\n\nA modo de consulta, también ofrezco una TABLA PERIÓDICA, con los símbolos, nombres, números atómicos, masas atómicas y VALENCIAS de todos los elementos, así como la posibilidad de acceder a un curso de formulación química.\n\nSi eres de los que no pagan por apps o te parece excesivo el precio, piensa en lo siguiente. El desarrollo y mantenimiento de una aplicación, web, servidores, publicidad, etc., tienen una serie de costes, que hay que afrontar. Si has ido recientemente al cine, y has visto una película que no te ha gustado, seguramente te habrá costado más dinero. Es una forma de fomentar la creación de herramientas de calidad, que NO te inundarán de PUBLICIDAD. En el sector tecnológico dicen que “CUANDO UN PRODUCTO ES GRATIS, TÚ ERES EL PRODUCTO”. Significa que usarán tus datos para usarlos con fines publicitarios, estudios de mercado, etc.\n\n¡DESCARGA AHORA YoFormulo!\n\n¿Necesitas más para aprender o no te convenzo? \n\nVisita mi web www.yoformulo.com.\n\nEspero haberte ayudado.\n\nUn saludo,\n\nSamuel de YoFormulo"

Educational App Review (iear.org): \"This app is fantastic!!\" \n\nThe Long Division app can be used to teach and study the long division method. Solving long division problems is also excellent subtraction and times tables practice. The app is easy to use and it has an intuitive interface with customizable colors and other settings. The user can solve custom and random division problems with small and large numbers.\n\nEducational App Review (iear.org): Purpose, program functionality and overall educational value are all rated A. \n\nEndorsed by Teachers\n\nR. Zeni, Ecole Sandy Hill Elementary, Abbotsford, BC, Canada:\n\n\"The Math apps by Esa Helttula allow students to practice and reinforce the specific computation strategies taught in class, with as much or as little scaffolding as necessary. I am so glad to have come across this great educational tool!\"\n\nWired.com:\n\n\"The Long Division app is very clear and very useful.\" \n\nEducation Apps Review, www.iear.org:\n\n\"This app is fantastic!! My third graders loved learning with this app! It has infinite enriching and differentiating possibilities, as the students can select easier or more challenging types of problems.\"\n\nPragmaticMom, www.pragmaticmom.com:\n\n\"My 5th Grader is learning long division and sometimes working through the problems step by step is confusing to her. So you can imagine how excited I AM with this app, named Long Division, that translates long division into a color coordinated step by step process and has a number key pad so that the student can input their numbers every step of the way. Then, the numbers slide from the problem, into their proper place in the problem. Very visual and memorable!\"\n\nAppReviewLive, www.appreviewlive.com:\n\n\"It’s almost like having a teacher in the palm of your hand..\"\n\nThe Long Division Method\n\nIn arithmetic, long division is the standard procedure suitable for dividing numbers. The method breaks down a division problem into a series of easier steps.\n\nEasy to Use\n\nThe app allows the user to solve a long division problem step by step and animates all the steps. In the steps the user will divide, multiply or subtract. The correct answer will fly to the right place. If the user presses the wrong button the answer will appear above the keyboard but it will not move. \n\nFeatures:\n\n- The dividend can have 1 - 5 digits\n- The divisor can have 1 - 3 digits\n- Remainders can be allowed or disallowed\n- The dividend and divisor can have decimals and the decimals can have leading zeroes\n- The app will place zeros in order to extend the division to the next decimal place, if needed\n- The divisor can be bigger than the dividend\n- The current operation for each step can be hidden\n- The operands for the current operation can be highlighted\n- The speed of the animations can be set\n- Numbers to divide can be generated randomly or entered manually\n\nOther iDevBooks math apps \n\niDevBooks math apps have been reviewed and endorsed by Wired.com, IEAR.org, Edudemic.com, Teachers with Apps, and other respected sites and organizations.\n\nSome of the other 40 iDevBooks math apps are Column Addition, Column Subtraction, Long Multiplication, Lattice Multiplication, Visual Multiplication Table, Fraction Math, Partial Differences Subtraction, Partial Quotients Division, Partial Sums Addition, Decimal Rounding, etc. \n\nFeedback and requests for new features \n\nNew ideas to make this app better are welcome. Please visit idevbooks.com to give feedback.\n\nPrivacy\n\nThis app has no ads or in-app purchases and it does not transmit any data during the operation of the app. This app also does not contain any links to other apps or the web."

Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

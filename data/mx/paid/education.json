      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.\n\nThere are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe\n\nSome kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video!

Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "Me llamo Samuel. Si has llegado hasta aquí, puede ser por casualidad o curiosidad. Pero, lo lógico, es que sea porque tengas PROBLEMAS con FORMULACIÓN QUÍMICA y NOMENCLATURA QUÍMICA (formulación inorgánica).\n\nEs normal, se le suele \"atragantar\" a la mayoría de personas que he conocido. Para eso estoy aquí, para AYUDARTE.\n\nPor eso te pido que dediques ahora unos segundos a leer lo que comento a continuación.\n\nEn 2013 publiqué la primera versión de YoFormulo. Tras varios cientos de miles de descargas en todas sus modalidades, y siendo la aplicación de formulación química más descargada del mundo en español, decidí en 2019 que era momento de actualizarla y mejorarla.\n\nCon mi BASE de DATOS, podrás buscar compuestos por NOMBRE o FÓRMULA, ideal para hacer ejercicios de clase de una forma RÁPIDA y SIN ERRORES (no hay ninguna aplicación en el mercado que haga lo mismo, o yo no la he encontrado aún). Sé que algunos usáis esta parte para COPIAR en los EXÁMENES, pero no es lo aconsejable, si quieres aprender.\n\nUno de los \"defectos\" de la versión anterior era que necesitabas datos o conexión Wi-Fi para acceder a la base de datos. En esta versión, NO hace falta CONEXIÓN.\n\nSi quieres aprender, tengo una serie de JUEGOS de ENTRENAMIENTO que te ayudarán. Son juegos de preguntas y respuestas, adaptados para aprender nombres y símbolos de elementos, valencias y nombres y fórmulas de compuestos. ¿Te atreves con ellos?\n\nA modo de consulta, también ofrezco una TABLA PERIÓDICA, con los símbolos, nombres, números atómicos, masas atómicas y VALENCIAS de todos los elementos, así como la posibilidad de acceder a un curso de formulación química.\n\nSi eres de los que no pagan por apps o te parece excesivo el precio, piensa en lo siguiente. El desarrollo y mantenimiento de una aplicación, web, servidores, publicidad, etc., tienen una serie de costes, que hay que afrontar. Si has ido recientemente al cine, y has visto una película que no te ha gustado, seguramente te habrá costado más dinero. Es una forma de fomentar la creación de herramientas de calidad, que NO te inundarán de PUBLICIDAD. En el sector tecnológico dicen que “CUANDO UN PRODUCTO ES GRATIS, TÚ ERES EL PRODUCTO”. Significa que usarán tus datos para usarlos con fines publicitarios, estudios de mercado, etc.\n\n¡DESCARGA AHORA YoFormulo!\n\n¿Necesitas más para aprender o no te convenzo? \n\nVisita mi web www.yoformulo.com.\n\nEspero haberte ayudado.\n\nUn saludo,\n\nSamuel de YoFormulo"

      "label": "As you know Interruptions in chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can decrease the survival rate in out of hospital cardiac arrest. Perfusion stops when CPR stops. The chest compression fraction (CCF) is the amount of time spent administering chest compressions during cardiac arrest. If you can obtain a CCF above 80% you can dramatically increase the survival rate. The CCF Calculator works in conjunction with a compression rate of at least 100/min, assuring adequate compression depth and recoil. Thats why we also included a metronome for 100 and 120 beats per minute."

      "label": "Using a question-and-answer format, Airline Transport Pilot Checkride lists the questions most likely to be asked by examiners during the last step in the pilot certification process – the Practical Exam – and provides succinct, ready responses. Pilots will find this App an indispensable tool in both planning for what to expect during the ATP airplane checkride, and mastering the subject matter. Instructors rate them as excellent preparation for students, as well as preps for airman checks and interviews.\n\nThis Airline Transport Pilot Checkride app is based on the popular Airline Transport Pilot Oral Exam Guide book by Michael Hayes. It is designed for pilots training for the ATP certificate. More than 1,000 questions and responses ensure all the subjects an Airline Transport Pilot candidate will be tested on during checkrides, airman checks, and interviews are covered. Topics include: operation of systems, performance and limitations, weather information, high altitude aerodynamics, air carrier operations, human factors, and the code of federal regulations. Answers and explanations were researched using FAA documents (which are identified so pilots know where to go for further study) as well as interviewing FAA examiners.\n\nCompatible with iOS phones and tablets, this app teaches applicants not only what to expect, but also how to exhibit subject mastery and confidence when under the examiner’s scrutiny. It identifies candidates’ strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in their aeronautical knowledge, which increases study efficiency. App features:\n• More than 1,000 questions most frequently asked during an Airline Transport Pilot Airplane checkride are included with succinct, ready responses.\n• Ability to Mark questions from any subject to review collectively as a custom study session\n• Includes all the questions and answers from the popular book, Airline Transport Pilot Oral Exam Guide by Michael Hayes.\n• Brought to you by a trusted resource in aviation training and publishing, Aviation Supplies & Academics (ASA)."

Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

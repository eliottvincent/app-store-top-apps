      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "● IELTS Collocation: Learning collocations are highly recommended\n- Some of the most important vocabulary needed for IELTS writing are collocations. These are essential when expanding your vocabulary. Basically, collocations are 2 or 3 words that commonly go together and sound just right to a native speaker. For some tips on building your vocabulary take a look at this application. \n- If you do not know how to use collocations then they will sound or look ‘wrong’ to a native speaker .\n\n● Why are collocations so important?\n- In the marking criteria in IELTS, you are marked on Lexical Resource (vocabulary). You will be marked on the way you use collocations in the writing section, mainly essays. Here is what it says in the Public Band Descriptors about Writing task 2 Band 7\n- Not only are collocations in IELTS important for writing, but they are useful in the speaking test also. They give your speech a smooth natural flow, which if used well, can help you get a Band 7 or more in the speaking test. You have to know how to use them correctly though.\n\n● How do I learn collocations?\n- When you learn new words you must learn the surrounding words or the matching words that help it collocate. Do not just memorise words on their own. Collocations are like chunks of language and there are various patterns to these.\n\n- The best way to learn collocations is through reading, listening and making your own sentences. I advise making a vocabulary book where you write out example sentences. I do not advise making word lists because you must know how collocations work in the surrounding sentence. These also have to be reviewed regularly and put into practice.\n\n● There are quite a few patterns such as:\n- Verb + Noun\n- Verb + Adverb\n- Adjective + Noun\n- Adverb + Adjective\n- Noun + Noun\n- Collocations with ‘have’ or ‘take’\n\nThe app is free and support OFFLINE. It'll perfect for English learner."

      "label": "Learn Kotlin Programming for Beginner to Advanced Developer. Master Kotlin Programming and Become a Kotlin Ninja. This is an in depth training to the awesome new programming Language Kotlin, So if you are already a Java developer and thinking of switching to Kotlin for development or you just want to learn this awesome language to increase you skills.\nThis App is going to be your best friend. This app contains all the major topics of Kotlin Programming Language with Code Examples. With its beautiful UI and easy to learn guide you can learn the Kotlin Programming in few Days, and this is what make this app different from other apps. We are constantly updating this app with every new major Kotlin language release and adding more code snippets. \n\nTopics Included in this App:\n- Introduction to Kotlin Programming\n- Kotlin Installation and Environment Setup\n- Learn Kotlin Variables\n- Learn Constants\n- Learn Types\n- Learn Conditional in Kotlin\n- Learn Function\n- Learn about Numbers\n- Learn Strings\n- Learn Null Safety\n- Learn About Exception Handling in Kotlin Language\n- Lambda Expressions\n- Lists and Sets\n- Workin with Maps\n- Functional Programming Basics\n- Scope Functions\n- Learn Classes\n- Class Initialization\n- Inheritance\n- Objects, Data Classes, and Enums\n- Interfaces and Abstract Classes\n- Kotlin Generics\n- Extensions\n- Learn how to work with Coroutines with Kotlin\n- Using Kotlin for Web\n- Kotlin Mircroservices and much much more\n\n\nFew more Reasons to Learn Kotlin Programming Language\n\n1. Kotlin experience is in demand:\n\n2. You’ll develop projects faster:\nKotlin requires fewer lines of code to do the same things as other programming languages. It is an inherently concise language, so can solve many common development problems with just a few lines of code. \n\n3. You’ll improve the quality of the apps you build:\n\nKotlin improves the quality of your released apps through “safety” features that have been designed to reduce the number of bugs and system failures. For example, it has a strong type system based on null-safety. This means by default, variables can’t be null, so you can catch more errors at compile-time before shipping to users. \n\n4. You can use it with existing Java libraries:\n\nKotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, so apps you’ve already built can be migrated to Kotlin incrementally. You don’t need to stop using Java—you can use both! Extension functions give you a way to add functionality to existing classes (even Java classes) without a full rewrite to Kotlin. This means you can take advantage of Kotlin’s powerful features without having to abandon all the skills you’ve gained while building existing apps.\n\nSo if you Like our effort rate this app or comment below if you want to give us any suggestions or ideas.

      "label": "Me llamo Samuel. Si has llegado hasta aquí, puede ser por casualidad o curiosidad. Pero, lo lógico, es que sea porque tengas PROBLEMAS con FORMULACIÓN QUÍMICA y NOMENCLATURA QUÍMICA (formulación inorgánica).\n\nEs normal, se le suele \"atragantar\" a la mayoría de personas que he conocido. Para eso estoy aquí, para AYUDARTE.\n\nPor eso te pido que dediques ahora unos segundos a leer lo que comento a continuación.\n\nEn 2013 publiqué la primera versión de YoFormulo. Tras varios cientos de miles de descargas en todas sus modalidades, y siendo la aplicación de formulación química más descargada del mundo en español, decidí en 2019 que era momento de actualizarla y mejorarla.\n\nCon mi BASE de DATOS, podrás buscar compuestos por NOMBRE o FÓRMULA, ideal para hacer ejercicios de clase de una forma RÁPIDA y SIN ERRORES (no hay ninguna aplicación en el mercado que haga lo mismo, o yo no la he encontrado aún). Sé que algunos usáis esta parte para COPIAR en los EXÁMENES, pero no es lo aconsejable, si quieres aprender.\n\nUno de los \"defectos\" de la versión anterior era que necesitabas datos o conexión Wi-Fi para acceder a la base de datos. En esta versión, NO hace falta CONEXIÓN.\n\nSi quieres aprender, tengo una serie de JUEGOS de ENTRENAMIENTO que te ayudarán. Son juegos de preguntas y respuestas, adaptados para aprender nombres y símbolos de elementos, valencias y nombres y fórmulas de compuestos. ¿Te atreves con ellos?\n\nA modo de consulta, también ofrezco una TABLA PERIÓDICA, con los símbolos, nombres, números atómicos, masas atómicas y VALENCIAS de todos los elementos, así como la posibilidad de acceder a un curso de formulación química.\n\nSi eres de los que no pagan por apps o te parece excesivo el precio, piensa en lo siguiente. El desarrollo y mantenimiento de una aplicación, web, servidores, publicidad, etc., tienen una serie de costes, que hay que afrontar. Si has ido recientemente al cine, y has visto una película que no te ha gustado, seguramente te habrá costado más dinero. Es una forma de fomentar la creación de herramientas de calidad, que NO te inundarán de PUBLICIDAD. En el sector tecnológico dicen que “CUANDO UN PRODUCTO ES GRATIS, TÚ ERES EL PRODUCTO”. Significa que usarán tus datos para usarlos con fines publicitarios, estudios de mercado, etc.\n\n¡DESCARGA AHORA YoFormulo!\n\n¿Necesitas más para aprender o no te convenzo? \n\nVisita mi web www.yoformulo.com.\n\nEspero haberte ayudado.\n\nUn saludo,\n\nSamuel de YoFormulo"

Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

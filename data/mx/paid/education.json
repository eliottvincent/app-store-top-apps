      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Your children can then use the coins to unlock other cute characters.\nA motivating math app that has your children solving hundreds of math tasks in just minutes. Efficient math practice for grade school!\n\nLearning principle: how children have fun learning math\nOur tests have shown children voluntarily solving hundreds of tasks in a short time. On paper, that would be almost impossible.\n\nThe game principle is easy to understand: For every correctly solved task, the player jumps one step up the stairs. If the answer is wrong, they jump down one level.\nEach task solved is rewarded with a coin. But some tasks offer bonuses.\nYour children can then use the coins to unlock other characters.\n\nThe direct feedback and the proven reward system motivates the children to keep solving tasks.\nOur goal with Fiete Math Climber is for children to do arithmetic voluntarily because it's fun and they can see their progress.\n\nBehind the scenes, the app analyzes the child's task-solving style and continuously adjusts the difficulty.\nBy gently increasing the challenge, their motivation increases and they gain self-confidence in solving math tasks.\n\nNevertheless, it is always up to the children to decide how difficult they want the tasks to be: they can skip tasks they find too difficult, simplify them, or even make them harder.\nThis freedom keeps their motivation high and ensures that your child will have fun with this math app for a long time.\n\nHelps parents and teachers to identify and resolve issues\nThe app continuously analyzes the child's arithmetic and reveals the child's skills and potential issues with certain tasks. \nThe analytics algorithm immediately identifies issues and creates targeted sets of tasks.\nThe perfect add-on for math class.\n\nThe task list shows parents and teachers what tasks the child has tackled. \nThis makes it possible to see how far the child's skills have come and why they have issues with certain tasks. It will also parents and teachers to help address these issues.\n\nUser management allows multiple students to use the app at the same time.Extensive statistics provide information on whether a child is really improving.\n\n\nFeatures\n- Contains all arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n- Number range adjustable from 1 to 1,000\n- Pre-configured exercise sets include: arithmetic up to 20, multiplication tables, carrying tens, etc.\n- suitable for children ages 5 to 10\n- targeted training possible\n- task definition is comprehensively adjustable\n- motivation through entertaining game structure with direct feedback\n- long-term motivation through the possibility of collecting figures \n- user management\n - multiple players possible\n- statistics show learning progress\n- display all tasks solved\n- skills analysis\n- identify skills and potential issues\n- secure\n- all data remains on the device\n\n\nSUPPORT INFORMATION\nWe do our best to test our apps on all devices.

      "label": "“Nature for Kids,” from the series “Words for Kids,” is a game that promotes the development of children between 2 and 4 years of age.\n\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of natural objects and phenomena, seasons, fruits and vegetables, berries, flowers, and mushrooms, all while learning their names! \n\nThe carefully selected photographs will not only help a child learn the names of various natural objects and phenomena, but also expose him or her to the remarkable beauty of the world in which we live!\n\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she knows. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\n\nThe educational flashcards for tots are divided into the following categories: berries, fruits, vegetables, flowers, mushrooms, the environment (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), the seasons, and natural phenomena (rain, rainbow, sunset, lightning, etc.). \n\nOne important feature makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify, the child will see beautiful, colorful photographs of each object and phenomenon. \n\nClearly, it is not so easy to show real live lightning, rainbow or erupting volcano to a child. This educational app allows the child to “see” many natural objects and phenomena as they appear in reality, while allowing parents to tell the child more about them. \n\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \n\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \n\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\n\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian."

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

Add students to those groups. The App will then randomly select students from the highlighted group. All names will be displayed before a name is displayed for a second time. \n\n Features: \n• Call on your students in a different order every time. \n\n• If you want to exclude a Student/s from the selection, simply turn them off in the settings screen. This can be particularly useful for any absentees.\n\n• You can delete and edit Groups / Group member names easily inside the app.\n\n• The number of Students / Groups is limited only by the amount of free space on your device. \n\n• Use a FREE Dropbox account to backup and “Sync” your Groups/Group members with your other devices. You can even use the same Groups/Group members in our “Random Team Selector Pro” app (separate purchase).\n\n• If you have a lot of Groups/Group Members to define you can even import them from a text or CSV file. \n\n• The teacher can determine how many times any single name can be displayed. This avoids the problem of students “switching off” once their name has been selected once.\n\n• This is a Universal App for iPhone and iPad. \n\n• The Animated Graphics and multiple themes make the whole experience a pleasure and keep things fresh for the students. You can even create your own backgrounds. \n\n• Sound effects and background music help make the app more engaging but can also be switched ON/OFF individually as required.\n\n• You can apply a “Passcode” to access the settings screen.\n\n• Need to know where you are in the selection process. We have added a display option that shows the number of names drawn and the number of names remaining in the particular selection process.\n• Provide Feedback to the Developers directly from within the App….let us know how we can make it better.  \n\n• Share with your friends on Facebook or Twitter from within the App. \n\nWe value your feedback. Many of the features above are the direct result of Teacher feedback. If you have any ideas of ways the app can be improved we would love to hear them. Also, if you want to report a bug please use the “Email Support” button inside the app, or email us directly at support@edtechmonster.com We will always get back to you."

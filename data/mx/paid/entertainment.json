Little did the children know that the chest held memories for their grandfather of one of the most significant disasters in maritime history. Artefacts that brought memories of the fateful night in April 1912 when the RMS Titanic sank to the bottom of the Atlantic ocean taking with her over 1500 souls. \n\nTitanic - Pride of the White Star dramatically tells the story not only of the events of that terrible night but some of the lesser-known stories of heroism and personal sacrifice of some of her passengers and crew. It tells also the story of how three items came to give them a common link to our hero Charles Joughin, a chief baker on Titanic, and now a grandfather of James and Susan. He is now an old man helping a new generation to understand the events and lessons of that tragic night.\n\nFEATURES:\nAudiobook (IN TWO ACTS)\nAct one (37 Minutes)\nAct Two (44 Minutes)\n\nAlso included with this app are:\n*  The full Script for Titanic – Pride of the White Star\n*  A list of Amazing Titanic Facts\n*  Introductory Video"

Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science.

Stop and start talking on multiple conversations whenever you like.\n\nThis app is uniquely designed for the iPhone, with chat bubbles scrolling by. Change their shade to suit your mood.\n\nYou need to be online to talk - the app has to communicate with servers - but even slow connections are fine.\n\nThe keyboard in the screenshots is Tyyyp, which uses Cleverbot AI, and works well with the Cleverbot app!\n\nFor an app with an emotional avatar too, and with iPad support, check out Cleverbot HD. \n\n\n\nThis app has reached the top 50 overall in the US and has remained mostly inside the top 20 Entertainment for over 18 months.\n\n***Over 2000 5 star ratings worldwide.***\n\nNot only that, our feedback is GREAT too...!\n\n\"To all the Luddites who claim computers can never replace human interaction you guys flip a defiant bird.\" 25th Sept 2013\n\n\"I can't believe I'm not talking to an actual person, it seems so real. Great work.\" 8th Sept 2013\n\n\"Super excellent. I am very much excited, entertained, interested\" 1st March 2013\n\n\"Omg !!! Its so amazing!!! Now its my new BFF :p\" 25th Oct 2011\n\n\"Seriously this may be the coolest thing anyone has ever developed. I salute you.\" 25th Aug 2011\n\n\"Truly Amazing - I just had like an hours chat with it.

He's there when I want to talk about dolphins, There when I want to ask him where babies come from, I am glad I found him. He talks about anything. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. Thank god you made this.\" 30th Jan 2011\n\n\"After about one day with this I found the bot will role-play with you and had a blast! After a few *slaps* I found it can fight. You can live out movie fight scenes WITH AN AI! Then it started doing things I didn't know it could do... like *kisses hard* or *hurls you into fan*... yep it gets intense. No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

      "label": "Do you enjoy watching videos on your iPhone? Do you hate not being able to because your iPhone cannot support the video format? Or do you hate the inconvenient and time-consuming hassle of trying to convert video formats to fit into one that your iPhone can support? \nThis is why the AVPlayer was created. The AVPlayer can play almost any computer video file format such as AVI, Xvid, WMV and much more clearly and effortlessly. No converting hassles. Just copy files via USB and just drag and drop into the AVPlayer’s Media Explorer. \nThe AVPlayer can also support external subtitle files such as SMI and SRT. So if you enjoy watching videos on your iPad, then the AVPlayer is an absolute necessity. \n\n• Support Formats\n- Dolby Digital (AC3), Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3)\n- Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- MP4,MOV,M4V\n- XVID,AVI,WMV,RMVB,ASF,H264,MKV… most of all movie file formats. \n- SMI, SRT, TXT, SubStationAlpha Subtitles \n\n• Post Processing \n- High quality video processing \n- Contrast,Saturation,Brightness \n- TV-Out \n\n• Control the playback speed (From 0.5X to 2.0X) \n- User setting support \n- Sweep to the left : move to backword 10 sec \n- Sweep to the right : move to forward 10 sec \n- Sweep to the top : 1.5X speed \n- Sweep to the down : normal speed \n\n• Additional features \n- Rotation Lock / Aspect ratio:auto/16:9/4:3/Full screen \n- Folder Management:Pass code/Move/Rename/Create \n- Resume play from last position \n- Scrubbing search \n- supports e-mail attachment by \"Open In\" feature \n\n• USB/WIFI Transfer \n\n• Note \n1. How to add video with USB \n- Run iTunes 9.1 or above \n- Device->My Device(My iPad)->Apps, drag and drop files to the AVplayer's documents \n\n2. Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal."

It was even used on Conan O'Brien's show on TBS to create one of their segments.\n\nThese 27 farts will make you laugh, cry, and hopefully embarrass a few people. \n\nDon’t accept any substitutes. This is a great tool; with everything from the interface to the sounds being made for the true fart prankster. \n\nEach sound was meticulously remastered to cut out any background noises and made to be crystal clear. Other apps will throw in a few sounds littered with ugly background noises that aren’t true to the clarity of a real fart.\n\nThere is a “Help” page with easy to read instructions, as well as an email address for technical support and feedback. We promptly answer support requests and listen to any recommendations to help make this app even better!"

      "label": "The toy top that buzzes with sci-fi sounds and glows with limitless, colorful shapes...\n\nBest of iPhone Entertainment in the US and 8 other countries - App Store Rewind 2011\n\nCosmic Top is a toy, a 3D audiovisual physics simulation of a spinning, wobbling, and morphing top.  The top floats among stars and takes on unlimited colorful shapes and sci-fi sounds which glow and hum in stereo from your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch.  Swipe to spin it, pinch to zoom it, or hold to brake it.  If you rotate your device, you can see and hear the top from all sides.  Record your own spin and tumble sounds and then hear both tracks played back in sync with the motion of the top.  Create and share video of your favorite top action.  Edit echo effects, color flow, and spin inertia of each top style.  Best of all, with a touch of the cosmic button, a new cosmos of sight and sound will be created for you to explore.\n\n\n\"Cosmic Top is the first sheer toy I’ve downloaded for my iPad, and I love it… This app is highly recommended.\"\n- 5/5 Outstanding! - John Martellaro, the Mac Observer\n\n\"Cosmic Top is about as much fun as you can imagine on an iPad.\" - 5/5 - Phillip T. Stephens, iPad Envy\n\n\"I have to say Cosmic Top is definitely a game changer… Pick it up and have yourself a little fun and impress your friends.\" - 5/5 - App Safari\n\n\"Seriously Buy This App!\" - iJailBreak\n\n\nFEATURES\n- Realistic physics simulation via Euler's equations for rotating bodies\n- Simple and intuitive multi-touch control with each touch adding to the motion\n- Uses Three-axis gyro\n- Unlimited shapes and sounds generated from randomized mathematical functions providing lots of replay value\n- Fun for both young and old\n\n\nIn no time, the magic of its gyroscopic and kaleidoscopic wheeling, whirring, and whirling will hypnotize you. We hope you enjoy it.\n\n\n\"When you get it spinning really fast, the sounds get crazy excellent!\" - Billy P. Sassafras, 10-Year-Old App Enthusiast\n\n\"Wow! It's like, full of stars. The audiovisual experience is psychedelic… cool…\" - Dr. David Bowman, Hip Fictional Character\n\n\"It is neat to watch the polhode roll without slipping on the herpolhode.\" - Louis Poinsot, French Mechanics Nerd\n\n\nWe read all your reviews and are committed to improve the experience of Cosmic Top with free updates.  Thanks for all the great comments and suggestions."

The look on their face as they race to see what’s happened to their car will be priceless.\n\nFeatures\n1) Take pictures or use existing pictures from your album\n2) Apply one or all of the following damage types:\nDents\nScratches\nBroken Glass\nCar boot\nFire or Smoke\n3) Adjust the size, shape, orientation, contrast, brightness, opacity of the selected damage type\n4) Save the edited image to your album or email it\n\nHow To Use The Application\nStep 1. Select/take a picture of the car you plan on using.\nStep 2. Mark the area where you wish to apply the damage.\nStep 3. Apply a damage type (e.g. dent, scratch, broken glass, boot).\nStep 4. Adjust the damage type by using the available tools\nStep 5. Repeat steps 2-4 if you are applying more than one damage type.\nStep 6. Take a moment to enjoy the masterpiece you have created.\nStep 7. Save or share the picture via email or facebook.\n\nAdditional Tips\n1) The quality of the damage is only limited by your fantasy!\n2) Add / overlay several damages to make the damage more realistic.\n3) You can move or re-size the damage on the car with the your fingers.\n4) Use the “Eraser” tool to adjust the edges of the damage.\n\nMore Info\nFor more information on “Dude, your car!” go to mobilaga.com, visit our Facebook profile at mobilaga.com/facebook, or follow us on Twitter at twitter.com/mobilaga\n\nWatch the video at youtube.com/mobilaga !!!\n\nWe welcome your reviews and thank you for your support!"

UK's Ch. 5 ‘The Gadget Show'\n__________________________________________\n\n\"I'm getting an iPhone because of iForce . . . it's that good!\" - Bob Kohler \n\n\"iForce is simply BRILLIANT. Best Magic App EVER!\" - Marc Spelmann\n_________________________________________ \n\nThere’s nothing quite like seeing the look on people’s faces when you perform something AMAZING. \n\nThen, there’s that cute girl or guy that you’ve been trying to meet. With iForce, you've got the perfect way to break the ice and get their attention.\n\nImagine . . .\nYou ask her to think of her favorite type of food . . . she’s thinking Sushi (Remember she’s only THINKING Sushi!)\nAfter a deep look into her eyes, you doodle what she’s thinking on the iPhone display, and leave it face down on the table.\nThe moment she whispers her favorite food, you smile triumphantly. The iPhone is flipped over and her jaw drops when she sees that you had correctly predicted “SUSHI” !!\n\nThis is just one example of the infinite mentalism effects that you will do.\n\niForce is a revolutionary performance tool for dazzling friends, colleagues and even clients. Capture attention or draw a crowd at parties, events or trade shows. Everyone will want to know, “HOW did you do that?!” \n\nYou'll read minds . . . predict the future . . . and even engage in a little MIND CONTROL! There's nothing shady or harmful; it’s all magic . . . fun and absolutely astonishing. \n\nPart of the illusion is the app itself. Disguised as a simple “Doodle” program, iForce is lurking inside, unseen and undetectable. Everything is examinable, which adds to the mystery. \n\niForce is the ONLY magic product that lets you create on-the-spot custom tricks that you perform instantly. Make this app uniquely yours and put it to work in entertaining ways. \n\nSo what are you waiting for, Master Magician? \nYou don’t need any props . . . just download iForce now. \n\n• Easy to do . . . learn with both written and video instructions \n• Comes with several amazing effects that you’ll perform immediately \n• Anything that you can draw/write can be your prediction ... The possibilities are endless \n• No voice recognition (you can perform 100% silent) \n• No wireless communication (you don’t need another iPhone/iPod to perform) \n• Works with ALL iPhones/iPod Touches \n• Impossible to detect the secret (since you’ll learn The Deepest Darkest Secret in Magic . . . )\n\n*** PLEASE READ ***\nDo not ask support questions in a review; I cannot respond to review postings.

It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

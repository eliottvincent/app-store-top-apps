Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational app to help your toddler learn phonics and trace letters of the alphabet? Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

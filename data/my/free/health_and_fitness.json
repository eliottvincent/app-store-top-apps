Mengandalkan kepedulian serta partisipasi masyarakat untuk saling jaga dan meminimalisir resiko penyebaran COVID-19. \n\nHal ini ditujukan untuk melakukan pengawasan lokasi padat dan ramai yang memiliki resiko tinggi yang nantinya bermanfaat dalam menelusuri riwayat COVID-19 (Contact Tracing). Aplikasi akan mengidentifikasi status riwayat kontak atau kasus Covid-19 pengguna serta status vaksinasinya. Hal ini dilakukan untuk mendukung program penghentian penyebaran COVID-19 yang sedang diusahakan oleh pemerintah.\n\nSelain tujuan di atas, aplikasi ini juga dimanfaatkan untuk melakukan pendaftaran vaksinasi, scan QR untuk Check-In/Out dan dokumen perjalanan. Semua terkumpul jadi satu melalui aplikasi PeduliLindungi untuk memudahkan pengguna. \n\nSekecil apapun partisipasi Anda akan sangat berarti untuk menghentikan penularan COVID-19. Harapannya, adanya PeduliLindungi sebagai akses dan media, ditambah dengan partisipasi masyarakat dengan mengunduh dan menggunakan aplikasi ini, Indonesia bisa segera bebas dari COVID-19 dan bangkit kembali. \n\n* PeduliLindungi didukung oleh Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika, Kementerian Kesehatan, Kementerian BUMN dan Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana."

Visit records will be automatically removed after 31 days.\n\nIf there is confirmed case in a venue located in Hong Kong, the mobile app will notify those users who have visited the same venue at the same time with the infected person(s), thus increasing vigilance and self-protection awareness of citizens as well as enhancing public confidence in visiting different venues.\n\nUpon confirmation by Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, app users who are confirmed positive or preliminary positive of COVID-19 infection can share their visit history with the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health to help trace the relevant contacts.\n\nThe mobile app allows the app users to store their Vaccine Pass records (e.g. COVID-19 vaccination records, vaccination medical exemption certificate and recovery record, provisional vaccine pass) and testing record. The mobile app automatic displays the app users selected Vaccine Pass QR code after scanning a venue QR code to facilitate the compliance with the “Vaccine Pass” measure. The Vaccine Pass QR code stored in the mobile app will be changed to red color if it is belonged to a COVID-19 infected person, and to amber code if it is belonged to a person under medical surveillance according to Department of Health’s records for the purpose of fighting the pandemic.\n\nThe mobile app also provides a Testing Registration Code function to enable app users to voluntarily store their personal information in advance. This function aims to reduce the time spent on queuing on-site and registration at testing points through a simplified registration process for app users to conduct COVID-19 nucleic acid testing if needed.\n\nThe LeaveHomeSafe mobile app is developed under the supervision by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/privacy \nPersonal Information Collection Statement: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/personal-information-collection-statement"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal. Or, see the full picture in browse, where you can find all of your health and wellness data.\n\nLearn more about Google Fit and see a list of supported apps at: https://www.google.com/fit"

      "label": "火爆全球的科学健康减肥方法！\n\n还在为计算食物热量而烦恼？还在花费大量精力查找健康减肥食谱？还在天天跳绳和keep复杂繁琐的健身和减肥操？来fasting，无需运动节食，健康瘦身减脂！\n\n《Fasting》是根据全球风靡的间歇性断食法（Intermittent Fasting)而打造出的一款健康、实用、简洁、免费的辟谷轻断食减肥记录APP。超多的轻断食食谱计划推荐，同时支持热量查询、饮食记录、体重记录、喝水提醒等超多功能，帮助你快速实现减脂目标的同时，变得更自律，养成健康的生活方式！如果你尝试了很多种减肥方法都不奏效，或者遇到了平台期，不妨试试这种全球流行的减肥方法。\n\n什么是轻断食？\n轻断食也叫间歇性禁食（Intermittent Fasting），是目前最受欢迎的健康减肥和健身趋势之一。轻断食并非节食，而是在断食和进食之间循环的一种饮食模式，躲过大脑监控的断食方式。\n\n轻断食的原理是什么？\n它的主要原理是，间歇性禁食期间，身体会耗尽储存的糖分，然后开始燃烧脂肪。它把我们人体消耗能量的模式，从葡萄糖的模式，切换到用脂肪的模式。一项小样本的研究表明，采取轻断食膳食模式8周后，体重平均下降了5.6kg，腰围平均缩小4.0cm，另外血压、总胆固醇、低密度脂蛋白、甘油三酯也都有所降低。同时轻断食通过细胞自噬的原理，可以减缓衰老！（2016年获诺贝尔生理学奖）\n\n轻断食健康吗？\n轻断食最为人所知的是用于减肥和排毒。研究显示，轻断食会改变激素含量，进而促进体内脂肪分解，作为能量使用。轻断食能有效的降低体内血糖和胰岛素水平，还会让身体启动自噬的代谢路径，这是排毒，修复和再生的过程，能有效减少炎症。它可以对抗衰老，并为一些疾病 (例如心脏病) 带来益处。 如果你一边keep健身，一边享受哥本哈根饮食，再结合轻断食，你的体重将会在短时间内变得好轻。You can be betterme！\n\n我适合轻断食吗？\n当燃适合！《辟谷轻断食》APP内有多种断食方案，适合各类人群。不管您之前是否有过经验，APP都可以根据您的实际情况，分析得出最适合你的减肥断食计划，并引导你完成和坚持。通常按照轻断食计划去执行，一周内就可以看见身体的变化！无需节食，助您“食半功倍”。\n\n什么是断食计划？\n断食计划是指有规律的断食和进食，常见的断食计划有5+2、6+1、12-12、14-10、16-8、18-6、20-4、23-1等。其中最受欢迎的是5+2和16-8轻断食计划，5+2断食法表示的是一周7天，5天正常饮食，2天控制饮食，断食日的饮食热量男性不高于600千卡，女性不高于500千卡；16-8断食法表示的意思是一天24小时以内，16个小时不能吃东西，8个小时可以吃东西，假如你中午12点开始吃第一餐，那晚上8点之前，你可以进食，8点之后，就进入断食时间，以此为循环进行。\n\n 【Fasting如何帮你实现减肥目标】\n 断食计划\n*涵盖目前最火爆的轻断食计划，如5+2轻断食、16+8轻断食\n*每条计划都有对应的食谱，吃什么，怎么吃，什么时候吃，一目了然\n*每条计划都有对应的热量目标和饮水目标，比生酮饮食和哥本哈根更有效果\n*详细的知识讲解和断食指导，教你如何选择正确的食物，控制饮食\n\n数据统计\n*断食、体重、喝水、步数、腰围、饮食、运动等数据记录的功能，清楚的查看身体每天、每周和每月的变化\n*自动计算BMI和体脂率，帮助你选择最优的断食方式\n*支持与keep、乐刻、咕咚、美柚、华为运动、小米运动等应用的数据兼容\n\n提醒功能\n*监督你按时断食、饮食和喝水，帮助你养成自律好习惯\n*目标完成情况提示，清晰了解每日的变化\n\n改变，从这里开始。快来Fasting，一起成为更好的自己吧！\n\n免责声明\n轻断食是一种科学健康的饮食习惯，但是以下人群在使用前请咨询专业的医生或医疗保健专业人员：\n1.患有精神病或有精神病史以及有家族精神病史者，严重神经官能症患者以及严重忧郁症患者，癔症患者。\n2.严重心脏病者，脏器动过移植手术者，恶性病变晚期者，身体极度衰弱者，身体严重瘦弱者。\n3.年龄过大（超过70岁）和过小者（处于身体生长发育高峰期）\n4.消化系统有严重溃疡病患者，内脏经常出血者。\n5.心志不坚、性格多疑且易怒易变者往往效果不明显，因此也不宜参加。\n6.肺结核病人以及有传染病着，先天严重不足者（包括完全失去你劳动力、听力、视力者、痴呆着等）\n\nFasting VIP自动订阅说明\n*会员套餐：Fasting VIP月卡，订阅价格：68元/周\n全部会员功能\n*会员套餐：Fasting VIP年卡，订阅价格：128元/年\n全部会员功能\n*会员套餐：Fasting永久会员，价格：168元\n全部会员功能\n\n会员权益：订阅期间可享受套餐内对应服务功能。\n*付款：用户确认购买并付款后计入iTunes账户。\n扣款说明苹果iTunes账户会在到期前24小时内扣费扣费成功后订阅周期顺延一个订阅周期\n*取消订阅如果需要取消订阅，请打开苹果手机“设置”->进入“iTunes Store与App Store”->点击“AppleID”，选择“查看AppleID”，进入账户“设置”页面，点击“订阅”，选择取消订阅即可。如未在订阅期结束的至少24小时以内取消订阅，下个周期的订阅服务将自动续订。\n\n[HealthKit]\n- 与Healthkit中的运动数据保持同步。\n\n隐私政策：https://privacy.imfasting.cn/fasting/privacyPolicy.html\n用户协议：https://privacy.imfasting.cn/fasting/userAgreement.html"

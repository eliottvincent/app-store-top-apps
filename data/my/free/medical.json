The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

You can book appointments and chat with YOUR doctor, rather than a random doctor that you are unsure of. You will be able to book appointments for your family and friends with your trusted doctor. You will be able to schedule home care visits with your doctor and his/her trusted providers. Soon you will also be able to buy products that your doctor has curated and screened for you. The key is trust.\n\nAppointment bookings are secure and in real time. Your trusted doctor’s available time slots can be viewed from the app and you can choose the date, time and location to suit your convenience. Booking can be done 24/7 anytime, anywhere. You will receive reminders of your upcoming appointments and can view previous appointments. Reschedule or cancel your appointments through the app (within specified time limits). \n\nChat with your trusted doctor. Maybe you have a quick question that doesn’t need a trip down to the doctor. Your trusted doctor knows you and your medical history. He or she will be the best person to give you advice. With MaNaDr, you can quickly open a chat or a video consult with your trusted doctor. At the end of the chat, get a summary report from your doctor.\n\nNeed a home visit? Not just a doctor’s visit, but perhaps for nursing care, physiotherapy or other home care services? Look for your trusted doctor’s home care provider and book an appointment directly.\n\nChildren and the elderly without mobile devices are not left out. Add them as your family or friends and book appointments on their behalf.\n\nMaNaDr aims to be the one app for you and your family’s healthcare needs, from infancy to the golden years. For now, we connect you to your trusted healthcare provider but there will be much more to come. Stay tuned!\n\nYour healthcare data is secure. All communication between the mobile apps and our servers are secured by 256 bit SSL. \n\nThis app is currently applicable only in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia.\n\nBooking fees and consultation charges may apply."

In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings.

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

      "label": "【产品简介】\n柠檬胎动, 一款简约可爱的胎动计数器和宫缩记录器, 是怀孕妈妈孕期必备的数胎动和宫缩工具. 为您提供贴心的数胎动/提醒胎动计数/数宫缩的功能, 还具有胎动的历史数据统计、呈现和保留等功能, 为您掌握宝宝胎动规律, 确保胎儿健康成长提供有利的帮助.\n\n【产品特点】\n● 胎动记录 - 准确记录胎动数据不丢失\n● 宫缩记录 - 精确记录宫缩情况不费心\n● 科学专业 - 专业胎动宫缩计算不出错\n● 趋势统计 - 观察每日胎动走势不担心\n● 胎动提醒 - 准时提醒每次胎动不错过\n● 屏幕常亮 - 妈妈边看书边记录不麻烦\n● 温馨可爱 - 温暖而柔和的颜色不辣眼\n\n【数胎动的原因】\n胎动是胎儿在子宫腔里的活动冲击到孕妇子宫壁的动作. 胎儿在子宫内伸手、踢腿、冲击子宫壁, 这就是胎动. 孕妇怀孕期满4个月后, 可明显感到胎儿的活动. 胎动是孕妇临床产前胎儿监护技术中的重要内容之一. 胎动的次数多少、快慢强弱等表示胎儿的安危. \n\n【胎动的感觉】\n每个孕妇妈妈感觉到的胎动都是不一样的. 有的孕妈会感觉到有小鱼在肚子里面游泳, 或是像肠胃蠕动一样, 肚子里面“咕咕”作响；有的孕妈会感觉肚子里面, 像有水烧开了一样“咕咚咕咚”地响, 很多搞不清状况的新手妈妈, 会误以为自己喝了太多的水造成的, 却不知道这是宝宝正在运动呢. \n等到胎宝宝越来越大的时候, 他的活动也会越来越频繁, 越来越激烈. 等到胎宝宝六七个月之后, 孕妈妈就可以清楚地感受到, 宝宝在用小脚丫踢你啦. \n\n【数胎动的方法】\n方法1: 怀孕到28周起, 准妈妈可以开始数胎动. 准妈妈可在早、中、晚各用一小时测量胎动, 每小时不少于3次. 3小时的胎动总和乘以4, 结果不少于30次, 如少于10次应该立即就医. \n方法2: 建议在晚饭后, 因为这段时间胎动较为频繁, 采用左侧卧姿势, 记录10次胎动所用时间. 如果10次胎动在2小时内, 可以推测胎动没有异常, 如果感觉不到胎动或10次胎动的所用时间大于2小时, 应尽快找医生进行下一步检查. \n\n【宫缩】\n宫缩即子宫有规律地收缩，是临床上孕妇产检的一项重要监测指标。临产的主要标志是规律的子宫收缩。围生期和分娩过程中要对胎儿进行监护，监测内容包含胎儿心率、子宫收缩两个重要指标。胎心率电子监护中有一条宫缩曲线，宫缩曲线描记着宫缩压力上升、下降的速度、最高压力、持续时间以及两次宫缩的间隔时间。子宫收缩可引起胎心率加快或减慢，宫缩的状况好坏能直接影响胎心的活动及分娩。\n\n【宫缩压力】\n宫缩压力数据的采集来自胎儿心率监护仪，是胎儿心电监护的一个重要部分。监护时将测量子宫收缩强度的压力传感器置于孕妇腹部，当子宫肌肉收缩时，腹壁的张力置于压力传感器上，并将宫缩压力信号转变成电信号。压力电信号经数据采集系统进行加工处理，最后输入到监护仪中进行监测和分析。一般情况下，当宫缩压力值大于28mmHg时，孕妇就会感觉到疼痛，当这种疼痛过于频繁时，则称之为宫缩异常。它能对孕妇的早产和流产起到预警作用。因此，对孕妇的宫缩压力进行实时地监测，尽早地发现可能出现的异常，对孕妇的早产和流产能起到早预防、早诊断、早治疗的作用。\n\n【宫缩时间】\n宫缩时间是指子宫有规则地收缩的时间。孕妇临产时，会感到宫缩先由弱变强，维持一定时间后又逐渐减弱直至消失。子宫收缩最初是每隔20～30分钟出现一次，之后两次宫缩之间的间隔时间逐渐缩短到每次间隔15分钟、10分钟甚至5分钟。宫缩持续时间最初持续大约20秒，之后宫缩持续时间逐渐延长，增加到40秒甚至1分钟。\n\n【假性宫缩】\n分娩前数周，子宫肌肉较敏感，将会出现不规则的子宫收缩，持续的时间短，力量弱，或只限于下腹部或腹股沟区。经数小时后又停止，不会导致子宫颈口张开、胎头下降，故并非临产，称为假性宫缩。这种宫缩无规律性，无周期性，也不会有疼痛感。部分孕妇甚至在中孕期就能感受到不规律的宫缩。经产妇要比初产妇更为多见。真性宫缩（临产宫缩）与假性宫缩有所区别。临产宫缩更加规律，强度更大，伴有宫颈扩大、胎头下降，并可能有少量阴道流血。但即使非常熟练的临床医师，也很难仅仅依赖症状而区别频繁的假性宫缩和临产宫缩，而需要进一步观察、监测和产科体检。\n\n【宫缩乏力】\n产力是分娩的动力，以子宫收缩力为主。在分娩过程中，子宫收缩的规律性、对称性和极性不正常或强度、频率有所改变，称为子宫收缩力异常。子宫收缩异常临床上分为宫缩乏力和宫缩过强。宫缩乏力是指宫缩不随着产程的进展而增强，从而使产程时间拖长的状况。按发生时间可分为原发性宫缩乏力（产程开始就出现）和继发性宫缩乏力（宫口开大3cm进入活跃期后出现）。宫缩乏力受产妇全身情况等多种因素影响，例如产前精神过度紧张、术中过多使用麻醉剂或镇静剂、子宫过度膨胀（多胎、巨大儿、羊水过多）、子宫发育不良、严重贫血、妊娠期高血压疾病等。宫缩乏力是很多产妇遇到过的情况，宫口迟迟不开，除了致使产程拖延外，也会给孕妇和胎儿带来很大的危害，例如引发产后出血，增加胎儿宫内缺氧和创伤的机会等。\n\n【胎儿体重计算器】\n怀孕晚期医生都会给孕妇大体估计胎儿体重，尤其在孕妇住院以后，需要牵扯到治疗方案时，都会测量宫高、腹围，估计胎儿体重，然后医生给予孕妇建议。孕妇在门诊做B超时，B超医生通过测量胎儿的双顶径、头围、腹围、股骨长径，然后通过B超的公式，也会推算胎儿的大体体重。\n\n【相关知识】\n自然分娩是分娩方式的一种. 妊娠满28周及以上, 胎儿及附属物从临产开始到全部从母体娩出的过程, 称为分娩. 妊娠满28周至不满37足周期间分娩, 称为早产. 妊娠满37周至不满42足周期间分娩, 称为足月产；妊娠满42周及以后分娩称为过期产. \n分娩发动原因复杂、至今不明, 不少学说试图解释, 但均难以完整阐明, 公认是多因素综合作用的结果. \n随妊娠进展, 子宫发生相应变化. 妊娠早、中期子宫处于静息状态, 对机械和化学性刺激不敏感, 加之宫颈解剖结构稳定, 保证子宫能够耐受胎儿及其附属物的负荷. 妊娠末期子宫腔内压力升高, 子宫肌壁和蜕膜受压, 刺激肌壁的机械感受器, 同时胎儿先露部压迫子宫下段及宫颈内口, 发生机械性扩张作用, 通关神经传至下丘脑, 使神经垂体释放缩宫素引起子宫收缩. \n妊娠晚期孕妇体内的前列腺素、缩宫素、缩宫素受体、雌激素、孕激素、内皮素的变化, 会影响子宫收缩, 导致分娩发动. 但没有明确的实验指明哪种激素是分娩发动的始发原因. \n孕妇在即将分娩前身体与心理上都会有一个很大的转变, 并且此时, 您肚子中的宝宝也在蠢蠢欲动, 想要快点看到这个世界. 而临产前的一些胎动变化, 都会让你感觉到宝宝的存在, 而有些胎动会相对减少, 那这又代表着那些问题呢？宝宝的健康安危是妈妈们最为关心的问题, 那么以下就让我们一起来了解下有哪些原因吧. 分娩前胎动减少是否正常？现在又很多的孕妇称, 在于孕晚期时, 胎儿的胎动减少了. 因此有很多的妈妈担心宝宝腹里宝宝的健康. 不过也有不少的妈妈称, 一直到分娩前, 宝宝的胎动都很频繁, 并没有丝毫降低的情况. 不过不管宝宝在于您临产前胎动是否有减少, 只要宝宝的胎动次数并无十分突然的出现剧烈变化, 就无须太过于担心. 临产前胎动减少的原因有哪些？因为在孕期的后期, 胎儿的体积已经生长的越来越大了, 那么相对的活动的空间也就会越来越小, 所以, 胎儿翻身式的胎动也因此而减少. 并且, 在于临产前几周里, 胎儿就会慢慢地进入到您桶状的骨盆内, 为他的出生最好准备工作. \n怀孕期间应保持快乐的心情, 宝宝知道妈妈的心情变化, 所以一定要用乐观的态度对待一切. 多跟宝宝交流, 听胎教音乐、胎教故事；可以学习孕妇瑜伽, 适当运动；多加入同一个小区、同一个医院的妈妈圈、妈妈帮、妈妈社区, 同圈内的准妈妈一起分享怀孕的趣事、宝宝的发育情况, 会有很多话题. \n孕期运动: 孕妇在怀孕三个月之内, 最好的安胎方法就是静养, 这时候不适宜做瑜伽运动, 一般来说, 建议孕妇第4个月开始做孕妇瑜伽较合适, 有助于顺产和胎儿发育. 在怀孕头3个月, 胎儿尚处于胚胎阶段, 孕妇活动量不宜大, 以免引起流产."

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

More referrals, more credits!\n\nHandicap index:\n- Deemples currently uses the USGA handicap formula and is not recognised or an official handicap of any golf club.\n- Golfers use the Deemples handicap because the scores used to calculate the handicap cannot be submitted by them.\n- This requires 2 other golfers in the Deemples game to submit the same adjusted gross score, course rating, and slope rating for the golfer in order for it to count for handicapping purposes.\n- This submission method makes it the most trusted and non-manipulable golf handicap.\n- The Deemples handicap will be moving to the World Handicap System in due time.\n\nWhat if I'm new to golf：\n- Join any 1-1 or group beginner lessons on the app.\n- There are lots of beginner-friendly golf games for you to join if you want to get on the golf course.\n\nMarkets supported:\nDeemples is currently available in Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Australia and Malaysia.

Extend your competitions to include scoring directly at the target and provide real-time results after each end! Using wireless communication, the app always has direct contact with Ianseo to save and retrieve scores. Take your competitions to the next level.\n \nScorekeeper provides scoring for:\n• Indoor Target Archery\n• Outdoor Target Archery\n• Field Archery\n• 3D Archery\n \nThe app handles scoring for qualification rounds, elimination rounds, individual matches and team matches. Information is clearly displayed showing archer name/country, target placement, end number, target type and number of arrows to be scored. Archers can easily enter scores per end using the large scoring buttons. Swiping the screen provides a quick and easy way to navigate between archers and ends. An electronic scorecard is available to see all arrows shot, end totals, distance totals, and a running total for the whole competition. Online help is available directly in the app.\n \nSetup is a breeze using the QR-codes provided by Ianseo on the printable scorecards. A single scan of the code provides all the information needed to set up the the device. Score multiple targets with the same device. The app is translated into multiple languages and new languages are available for download directly from Ianseo.\n\n\nWhat is Ianseo?\nIanseo is a software for managing the results of an Archery Tournament; it is an Open Source Project developed thanks to the Italian Archery Federation's financial support, that decided to freely distribute it in whole Europe. Translated in several languages, Ianseo is the most up to date and advanced in the world integrating all the World Archery rules, but has evolved to include a comprehensive management of an Archery Tournament as a whole: from accreditation of the athletes and officers to every kind of printouts utilities, from network and online integration to field-of-play design."

This helps you:\n\n - to check your stringer’s performance\n - to monitor the loss of tension over the course of time\n - to identify the appropriate point of time for new strings\n\nWhy is this so important? When the strings wear out, the precision and the touch of the racket get lost – just as a racing car’s wheels start spinning when its tires are worn out.\n\nPlaying your badminton racket with fresh strings has many advantages:\n\n - higher repulsion power for longer clears and faster smashes\n - better feel for the ball and more controled hits\n - better shock-damping performance for joint-protection at arm and shoulder"

This helps you:\n\n - to check your stringer’s performance\n - to monitor the loss of tension over the course of time\n - to identify the appropriate point of time for new strings\n\nWhy is this so important? When the strings wear out, the precision and the touch of the racket get lost – just as a racing car’s wheels start spinning when its tires are worn out.\n\nPlaying your badminton racket with fresh strings has many advantages:\n\n - higher repulsion power for longer clears and faster smashes\n - better feel for the ball and more controled hits\n - better shock-damping performance for joint-protection at arm and shoulder"

More referrals, more credits!\n\nHandicap index:\n- Deemples currently uses the USGA handicap formula and is not recognised or an official handicap of any golf club.\n- Golfers use the Deemples handicap because the scores used to calculate the handicap cannot be submitted by them.\n- This requires 2 other golfers in the Deemples game to submit the same adjusted gross score, course rating, and slope rating for the golfer in order for it to count for handicapping purposes.\n- This submission method makes it the most trusted and non-manipulable golf handicap.\n- The Deemples handicap will be moving to the World Handicap System in due time.\n\nWhat if I'm new to golf：\n- Join any 1-1 or group beginner lessons on the app.\n- There are lots of beginner-friendly golf games for you to join if you want to get on the golf course.\n\nMarkets supported:\nDeemples is currently available in Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Australia and Malaysia.

Checkpoints can now be used multiple times, so Phi or Butterfly loops can be created\n\nYou can set up private or public course. \n\nPrivate if just for you, your friends, a school or club. Public if anyone can take part.\n\nSimple and great fun. It is free to use. Although designed for orienteering it can be used in any situation where you would like to time or score an event, or you simply what to show someone has traveled to a specific location. \n\nFor a fun example, you could use it on a stag night with a barcode at each pub or on a car navigation event to show various points have been visited. \n\nIf you use the app for something unusual then tell us about it as we'd love to hear about it."

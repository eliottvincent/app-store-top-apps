We have no way of contacting you if you post an issue as a review.\n--\n\nHomeBudget is an integrated expense tracker designed to help you track your expenses, income, bills-due and account balances. It offers support for budgeting, and allows analysis of your expenses and income, including charts and graphs. Two key differentiating features of HomeBudget are: \n\n1. Integrated set of features. The features within HomeBudget are well integrated such that a bill can become an expense (when you pay for it) and also adjust the account balance at the same time.\n\n2. Family sync.

Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

It takes advantage of price correlation between various Forex pairs. Currency strength is measured for 8 currencies (USD, JPY, EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, CHF & CAD) and is reported on a scale of 0 (weakest) to 10 (strongest). \n\nCurrency strength data provides the trader with important insights into the forces at play causing a move on a particular Forex pair. For example, if GBP/USD suddenly trends upwards following an economic news announcement (e.g. US Non-Farm Payroll), the currency strength values would immediately indicate whether the move was due to generalized GBP strength or USD weakness.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nStreaming currency strength data feed - fast updates, low latency. Accurate and reliable\n\n8 currencies and 4 currency strength time-frames. Currency strength resolution down to 1 min on lower time-frames.\n\nBar Chart. Multiple time-frames, history viewer feature, real-time max/min highlighting.\n\nLine Chart. For real-time and historical data. Multiple time-frames, zoom. Customizable currencies, gridlines etc.\n\nDark Mode support (requires IOS13+)\n\nMultiple bar chart color themes.\n\nAdjustable chart Time-Zone.

Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

Your details will be attractively displayed on the one hand in the form of a bar chart, on the other hand the bar chart is used as a control panel to simulate various scenarios. This simulation allows you to vary the most important parameters in small steps, so that \"what if\" scenarios can be simulated playful. For example, increase the duration of a savings plan, a single swipe from left to right across the graph is sufficient. \n\nALL FEATURES AT A GLANCE\n- All calculations are done in real time directly after entering the data.\n- Add extra payments or conditions in the mortgage calculator.\n- Add extra payments in the savings plan calculator.\n- Calculation dialog to calculate the financing requirements.\n- Changing the language / currency within the app.\n- Rapid change between year and month.\n- Calculator function in data entry.\n- Graphical simulation.\n- Results field adjustable.\n- Bar and pie chart for clear presentation of the results.\n- Start month can be assigned.\n- If necessary, additional help texts can be displayed for each input field.\n- Automatic backup of data entered.\n- Comparison between calculation variant A and B.\n- Create PDF / HTML reports, print and email.\n- Direct printing of all reports via AirPrint.\n\nFREE TRIAL\nFirst try, then buy: You can download and test the demo version of MarkMoney free. In contrast to this full version interest payments can only be calculated quarterly there. In the full version interest payments can be calculated, of course, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually. Thus, they are not forced to buy a pig in a poke.\n\nFAST SUPPORT\nUnfortunately, Apple does not allow you to respond to questions in the ratings. So please send us your questions and always contact us directly. Our support will help you and will answer usually within a very short time. We welcome your criticism, ideas and suggestions.

The stock you are interested in using this valuation model to measure it, can provide a very good reference.\nOf course, you might say, how about the case that stock data itself has fake? Therefore, we recommend that you look at the Price-to-Sales Ratio(P/S or PSR) of the stock, the stock P/S is too high, or the possibility of financial fraud is very large, or is pushed stock prices too high.\nIn practice, we should also consider a stock's capitalization, small-cap stocks rose  fast (though falling fast too), but in general, if the valuation results almost, prefer small-cap stocks, in general , the proceeds will be significantly much better.\nRobust stock-picking strategy : trading below intrinsic value + branding + small stock capitalization\nAny stock valuation models, can not be perfect precision, but the \"Stock Intrinsic Value Calculator\", would be a very good reference.\n\n“A general definition of intrinsic value would be that value which is justified by the facts—e.g. assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects. In the usual case, the most important single factor determining value is now held to be the indicated average future earning power. Intrinsic value would then be found by first estimating this earning power, and then multiplying that estimate by an appropriate ‘capitalization factor’”.   – Graham\n\n“Intrinsic value is an all-important concept that offers the only logical approach to evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses. Intrinsic value can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.”  - Buffett\n\n“The calculation of intrinsic value, though, is not so simple. As our definition suggests, intrinsic value is an estimate rather than a precise figure… two people looking at the same set of facts… will almost inevitably come up with at least slightly different intrinsic value figures.” - Buffett\n\nBuffettology:\nThe book, Buffettology, is a fantastic resource, primarily written by Warren Buffett’s former daughter-in-law, Mary Buffett. The co-author, David Clark, is a long-time friend of the Buffett family. Since these authors probably have some special insight into how Warren Buffet privately analyzes stocks.\n\nBuffettology outlines a few different methods to determine the value of a stock and whether or not it is a good buy. Two of the most popular methods revolve around “Earnings Yield” and “Future Price Based on Past Growth.”\n\nCompound interest:\nCompound interest is interest added to the principal of a deposit or loan so that the added interest also earns interest from then on. This addition of interest to the principal is called compounding. A bank account, for example, may have its interest compounded every year: in this case, an account with $1000 initial principal and 20% interest per year would have a balance of $1200 at the end of the first year, $1440 at the end of the second year, $1728 at the end of the third year, and so on.\n\nWarren Buffett is a living testimony to the miracle of compound interest - in this case with a sustained high growth rate over an amazingly long period of time. Compound interest - along with his frugal ways and unique investment skills - has made him one of the world's richest people.\n\nWarning: For Reference Only. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!"

      "label": "Bank Card Checker tells you the Bank or Financial Institution that issued any given credit/debit card by checking its huge internal database. Additionally it validates the card number.\n\nDo you run a shop or office where you need to take orders that are paid for by credit card over the phone? Need to check that the card information a customer is giving you is valid? With Bank Card Checker you can be sure that a card number is valid and perform extra checks on the card such as the Bank or financial institution that issued it, what country it was issued in, whether it is a company/corporate or personal card and whether it's a credit/debit/visa/mastercard etc.\n\nThis incredibly easy to use application lets you view Credit or Debit Card Issuer data on your iPhone as well as validating the card number. The App interrogates its internal database of Card Issuer data to tell you the name of the bank or financial institution, the country the card was issued in, whether the card is a consumer or corporate account and the scheme type (VISA Credit, VISA Debit, Mastercard Credit, Maestro etc) .\n\nThe App can determine Card Issuer data from just the first 9 digits of the card number. In order to check that the number is valid then the whole number must be entered. \n\nThe internal database has hundreds of thousands of banks/financial institutions records in it ensuring that more than 99% of the worlds organisations are covered. The App will be updated regularly to ensure that the database stays up to date.\n\nThe App does not store any entered card data and does not connect to the internet to obtain issuer data.\n\nNOTE: The App does not check card expiry dates. This data is not publicly available."

No more looking through numerous graphic images to match or memorizing what each pattern means. Enter specific values to find possible matches and then see the trade action. Patterns can also be found by name, prior trend, signal type (bearish/bullish), number of candles, or marked favorites. Each candle pattern provides image, name, signal, reliability, rating, trend, colors, how to recognize, recommended trade actions, and your own custom notes.\n\nCandice employs a visual table of contents as well as a full index dictionary name reference. Caveat notes are provided as a separate extendable database on chart patterns as well as other references.\n\nCandice comes with three game study operations: Flashcards, Guess and Press, and Slide Show to learn candle patterns.

      "label": "The forex market is available for trading 24 hours a day. However, this doesn’t mean it’s always active throughout the whole day. Most successful traders understand this and choose to trade during times when market activity is high and avoid times when trading is light. Spreads are tighter during these periods and currency movements backed up by high trading volume are more likely to follow through. \n\nForex Hours Pro provides a quick overview of the status and local time of major forex markets in the world. At those overlapping trading hours it is likely you will find the highest volume of trades and therefore more chances to win in the foreign currency exchange market. The status and local time are updated in real-time thus no refresh is required. \n\nIn addition, you can also choose to receive notifications/alerts when your favourite market open and closed. \n\nThis Pro version has no ads.\n\nJoin our facebook fan page. \nhttp://www.facebook.com/codingtrader \n\nFor technical support / enquiries, please email our technical support team at codingtrader.sg@gmail.com\n\nNote: \n\nThis application assumes local trading hours of 8:00 AM - 4:00 PM in each Forex market from Monday to Friday excluding holidays as most participants trade between these times in their local time zone. \n\nThe current version of Forex Hours Pro comes with the 5 major markets.  If there is a Forex market which you wish to be included in this app, do drop us an email for evaluation and we may include it in our next update.  =)\n\n******* IMPORTANT NOTE ******* \nPlease visit http://www.codingtrader.com to view the new screenshot for this new update."

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

Covering all 5 stations, MRCP PACES is crammed with detailed examination and history findings for a wide range of the most commonly occurring scenarios, along with key facts to provide a framework to answer those challenging examiner questions.\r\n\r\nMRCP PACES from ReviseAid incorporates a range of iPhone features including a built-in timer feature and benefits from a seamless user journey. Other fantastic features include:\r\n\r\n* No subscription required and once the app is downloaded no internet connection is needed\r\n* A full glossary of abbreviations\r\n* Timing functionality tailored to individual stations\r\n* 50 original scenarios covering the breadth of the examination, with more being added all the time.\r\n* Full support from the ReviseAid team.\r\n\r\nThe app is designed as an aide memoir while seeing patients on the wards prior to your exam. It is best used in pairs; one candidate holds the app while the other is examined. For stations 1,3 & 5 there is information on the things to look out for in the examination, an example presentation and a comprehensive list of facts for questioning. Stations 2 & 4 facilitate role play as each candidate has differing information pages. In order to mirror the exam there are timers for each scenario to help you get up to speed.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!"

Simply enter the known variable and the data is instantly calculated. \n\nDeveloped by an Emergency Physician, this app minimizes the risk of medical errors allowing the provider to spend more time caring for the patient, and less time looking up and calculating doses.  \n\nIt is a critical companion for any physician, nurse, paramedic, or medical trainee involved in the care of critically ill pediatric patients."

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

Create a Favorites list, and search and filter it similarly.\n\nThe best mnemonics can be those you make yourself. Add your own mnemonics to the database, where they'll appear seamlessly alongside those which come with the program.  Submit them instantaneously to the Medical Mnemonics server for review by an MD (that's me!) and inclusion in the next version.\n\nYou can email any mnemonic to a colleague from within Medical Mnemonics. He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human.

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We assume no liability for any personal harm or injury sustained as a result of using this application."

      "label": "Simple, fast, yet more thorough than any other pregnancy wheel available for the iPhone, Perfect OB Wheel is better than just a replacement for your trusty paper wheel.\n\nHere's why Perfect OB Wheel is your best choice of gestational calculator:\n\n 1) Input flexibility: Start with one of:\n    • Last menstrual period (LMP)\n    • Conception date\n    • Estimated date of confinement/delivery (EDC)\n    • Ultrasound dating: Number of weeks and days gestation as of a given date (\"X Weeks\").\n\n 2) Input speed: Other wheels for the iPhone make you conform to them for entering your patient's information. Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

This award winning program reliably analyzes and diagnoses your baby’s cry, then recommends helpful solutions – all in less than 5 seconds! Is your baby hungry, sleepy, annoyed, stressed or bored? The Cry Translator will tell you. Click “…More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n- Awarded Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n\n-  I love it ! A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

(Home, work, daycare, etc.  Want to add Grandma's house?  You can easily add custom locations.)\n\n* Milk Maid keeps track of individual bottles and bags by pumping date so that you can use the oldest milk first.  Milk Maid is flexible.  You can combine milk from multiple pumping sessions or pour milk from one bottle into multiple bottles and freezer bags.\n\n* Record the bottles and bags used by you or your caregiver each day.  Have a business trip?  Milk Maid will calculate the average milk you used last week to help you estimate how long your stash will last.\n\n* Set an expiration period for each storage location and Milk Maid will track the expiration time of each bottle/bag in your stash.  Browse the stash to see containers that are nearing expiration or expired.\n\n* Use Milk Maid's optional features like the handy timer if your pump does not have one and the Left/Right feature to track each side separately.\n\n* Milk Maid supports oz or mL or both.  Milk Maid remembers which units you used last so you don't have to keep entering it over again.\n\n* Browse and edit your entire history of pumpings and feedings.\n\n* Quickly and easily browse your entire inventory of fresh and frozen milk in multiple locations.  See the total volume stored in each location.\n\n* Export all data in CSV (spreadsheet) and RTF (word processing) format via email or wifi to share with your caregiver or healthcare provider."

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

In just ONE app there is 1) a gestational age calculator, 2) an ultrasound biometric calculator, 3) a fetal weight calculator, 4) a list of key weeks and trimesters, 5) an age-adjusted risk table for trisomy 21 and aneuploidy, 6) a BMI calculator, and NOW 7) an Apple Watch app is included with your purchase!\n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 is a state-of-the-art gestational age calculator (also known as an obstetric or pregnancy wheel) that is used every day by doctors, obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and pregnant women. The OB Wheel Pro 7 is a professional tool that replaces the need for multiple apps and it greatly enhances the functionality of those worn-out cardboard wheels without compromise. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 accurately determines the estimated delivery date (EDD), or due date, of a pregnancy based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or from the date of conception, or from a known gestational age (GA) on a known date, e.g. from an ultrasound measurement, or from fetal biometry like Crown-Rump Length (CRL), Femur Length (FL), and BiParietal Diameter (BPD). Additionally, for appropriate gestational ages, The The OB Wheel Pro 7 estimates fetal weight and displays the number of days completed and remaining. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7, besides calculating GA from fetal ultrasound biometrics, enables clinicians to also calculate Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) from FL, BPD, Head Circumference (HC), and Abdominal Circumference (AC) using the most appropriate published reference formula using the maximum and most appropriate parameters.\n\nPrenatal care providers know that there are key gestational ages where testing or interventions are needed. The OB Wheel Pro 7 lets providers see at a glance when these items should be scheduled.\n\nFEATURES\n• Includes Apple Watch app! \n• Gestational Age Calculator from LMP, EDD, Conception Date for any reference date\n• Gestational Age calculated from specific date and gestational age (e.g. ultrasound)\n• Gestational Age Calculator using fetal biometrics (CRL, FL, BPD)\n• Fetal Weight Calculator using HC, AC, FL, BPD\n• Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator\n• Age-Adjusted Risk Table for Trisomy 21 and aneuploidy\n• List of key completed weeks during pregnancy\n• Pregnancy days completed and remaining, and dates for each trimester\n• Remembers last-used EDD\n\n\nPRO TIPS: \n• To enter Gestational Age, CRL, FL, or BPD for a specific date (like for an ultrasound exam), tap \"Today\", enter the desired date, then tap on the button displaying the gestational age to change that button to display options for entering a specific GA, CRL, FL, and BPD. \n• When using the GA calculator, double-tap a date to change the value to the current date.\n• When using the EFW calculator, double-tap a value to clear the value of the selected parameter."

      "label": "ObWheel is a handy app that puts the traditional pregnancy dates wheel into the palm of your hand! ObWheel is useful for expectant parents as well as obstetricians, family physicians, nurses, midwives, and students. It uses the date of Last Menstrual Period (LMP) to calculate Estimated Due Date (EDD) and Gestational Age (GA). No more imprecise paper wheels - this tool is always at hand, in your pocket!\n\nWe've separated the outer and inner wheels to make this easy-to-use. Spin the green wheel to set the LMP date. Spin the purple wheel to browse important milestones, and to calculate the gestational age on a specific date (displayed in the middle).\n\nPrefer to enter dates manually? No problem. Select \"Set\" and choose dates by LMP, EDD, or GA on a specific date. Use the \"Info\" screen to see important dates (trimesters, testing and windows) and information on fetal biometry reference ranges (Lessoway) based on current gestational age.\n\nNeed to calculate the EDD from a dating ultrasound report? Rotate the purple wheel until the GA shown matches the GA on the ultrasound report. Then, rotate the green wheel until the date matches the date of the ultrasound. The EDD will be displayed below. Alternatively, input the GA and ultrasound date manually in the \"Set\" screen.\n\nObWheel is a universal app and works on the iPhone and iPad! We are continually working to improve ObWheel, and appreciate your feedback."

      "label": "Instant Z-Scores For All The Paediatric Cardiology Parameters You Review Everyday.\n\nCardio Z has been developed by the experienced Paediatric Cardiology team at Evelina Children's Hospital, London, UK in collaboration with the technology company UBQO. The application makes it easy to calculate Z-scores and centiles for the many cardiac and paediatric measurements that are made in normal clinical practice. Cardio Z distils a wealth of clinical research parameters into a single accessible format.\n\nZ–scores and centiles are a means of expressing how far a measurement is above (positive Z-score) or below (negative Z-score) the average for the size or age of a patient. They are particularly important in assessing and monitoring growing patients, from fetal life though to adulthood.\n\nHealth professionals need to be able to access the normal ranges for cardiac parameters at every age and size, and cross-checking of measurements can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Cardio Z will prove invaluable for both clinicians working directly in Paediatric Cardiology, and those who work in other fields of Paediatrics.\n\nCardio Z allows users to access Z-scores without the need for an internet connection, or the requirement to input the same data in multiple calculators. Users can define their own settings so that they can be sure that their use of z-scores is consistent over time, whilst still allowing flexibility for the experienced clinician. Comprehensive guidance is available ensuring that measurements are consistent with those of the original research, allowing valid comparisons.\n\nCardio-Z creates a summary of all z-scores for each patient, which can then be saved, e-mailed or printed. Simple, reliable and time-saving.\n\nFULL LIST OF FEATURES:\n\n- Cardio Z allows calculation of z-scores of:\n- Height, weight, BMI and head circumference\n- Clinic blood pressure, with calculation of a user-defined 'target centile' blood pressure\n- Echocardiographic measurements of most cardiac structures, including valves, chambers, vessels and coronary arteries\n- Fetal echocardiographic measurements, using gestational age, femur length or biparietal diameter as size reference\n- M-mode echocardiography, including TAPSE\n- Pulsed wave velocities, including E/E' ratio and E/A ratio\n- Tissue Doppler velocities and time intervals. Including Isovolumetric Contraction Time (IVCT), Isovolumetric Relaxation Time (IVRT), Ejection Time and Myocardial Performance Index\n- Discriminant scores for neonatal aortic stenosis with borderline left ventricle\n- ECG parameters (2nd and 98th centiles) and corrected QT interval calculation\n\nEXTRA FEATURES:\n\n- Guidance tips for measurements, including diagrams and notes of the methods of the original researchers\n- Centiles, as well as z-scores, displayed for all parameters\n- No need to re-enter height and weight: baseline data only needs to be entered once\n- Generation of a .pdf summary which can be saved, e-mailed or printed\n- Saved patient Z-score summaries can be accessed and edited at a later date\n- Short-cut keys for frequently used parameters\n- Body surface area calculator can be defined to use the same algorithms as the original research\n- Cardio Z reduces the inconvenience of making Z-score calculations, and improves the correct application of this important clinical tool. The App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions.  \n\nWe hope you enjoy using Cardio Z!"

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

      "label": "How this iridology app works: all you have to do is take a picture of your eye, zoom in to the iris, and mark the dark pigmentation spots by drawing on the screen.\n\nHealth Test will analyze the picture and list all the organs and tissues that are affected according to the iridology chart. \n\nInteractive HD chart is included to view organs and tissues.\n\nFurthermore you can read the interesting history of this technique as a kick-starter and learn a little bit more while analyzing your friend’s health too.\n\nIt can indicate your weak organs and tissues such as:\nheart, kidney, liver, pancreas, stomach areas, lung, throat, adrenal, prostate, bronchus, eyes, bladder, diaphragm, pelvis, pleura, thorax, groin, gullet, urinary, thyroid and the list goes on.  \n\n\"Better health is not a science problem it's an information problem. We all know that the patient is the best doctor for himself and now it's up to you!\"\n\nHow? Well, Egyptian, Chinese, Indian, Tibetan doctors and even the Nazis used this alternative medicine technique called iridology. And \"Health Test\" app is an automated iris diagnostics system that will match your iris photo to the iris chart, which divide the iris into zones that corresponds to specific parts of the human body. You wouldn’t believe how much your eyes can tell about your health, it’s all connected. Try and see it for your self! It’s amazing when you can read your self from your eyes.\n\nHealth Test results are automatically generated by doing a three-step process. After analyzing you can run a catalog of the results by date, view them in details and even share it. Eventually you can take actions in your life by doing further investigation with your doctor’s recommendation."

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

The anatomy tab gives an overview of anatomy related to the specific block, it includes schematic diagram’s which can be expanded to full screen. The procedures tab is a full pictorial and text guide to the performance of the specific block, including annotated ultrasound screen captures to help visualise nerves. The tips tab contains useful advice related to the selected block, also included is advice on the use of ultrasound and local anaesthetics.\n\nA must have app for both junior and senior anaesthetic staff as well as practitioners working within regional anaesthesia.\n\nThe blocks are:\n\nInterscalene & Mapping\nSupraclavicular & Mapping\nInfraclavicular\nAxillary x 2 & Mapping\nRadial Nerve & Mapping\nMedian Nerve & Mapping\nUlnar Nerve & Mapping\nTAP\nFemoral Nerve & CPNB\nSaphenous Nerve\nPopliteal Sciatic\nPECS1\nPECS2\nPECS1 and 2 combined\nSerratus anterior\n\nDedicated nerve mapping videos now make orientating yourself with anatomy even easier. Using demonstrator video interlinked with annotated live ultrasound scanning can help you to locate and track nerves and other relevant anatomy. (The nerve mapping videos will be available as online content to cut down on the size of the app, an internet connection will be required to access these.)More blocks will be added to this app, contact us to let us know what you would like to see in future updates.\n\nwww.raguru.com\n\nThis App is exactly what it says it is - it’s a guide. It doesn’t set out to replace a standard text book. It certainly isn’t a substitute for a sound knowledge of anatomy and local anaesthetic pharmacology. It’s more of a guide to the occasional blocker, a refresher to the more experienced, and a teaching aid to the trainer. \n\nWe are a busy hospital with a heavy teaching commitment. Therefore we choose to use nerve stimulation in conjunction with ultrasound as we feel it adds another layer of safety to the patient, and reassurance to the operator."

This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

      "label": "iCXR is a detailed chest radiograph pocket reference and manual for the iPhone and iPad. \n\n \n\"highly recommended for any healthcare professional/medical student interested in developing their CXR interpretation skills\" - iMedicalApps.com\n\n***** \"Best of its kind\"\n\n***** \"Excellent chest radiograph application\"\n--User comments from US store--\n\n*****\"Great app for all doctors, especially radiology trainees!\"\n\n*****\"Very impressive\"\n--User comments from UK store--\n\nThe app contains more than 200 high quality images of common and uncommon conditions and a simulated PACS work station. A detailed manual with 14 chapters is an ideal companion if you are a medical student, radiology resident, radiographer, a medic on the ward or preparing for board exams. It teaches the beginner (and perhaps not so much of a beginner) the technique of interpreting a chest radiograph. Over 70 flash cards on specific conditions provide short and succinct information, ideal when that odd looking film shows up on the screen. Unlike a traditional book, each condition is provided with multiple example images for better understanding.\n\nThanks to the beautiful high resolution screen, iCXR virtually turns your device to a mini PACS work station. Zoom the image by using familiar pinch gestures, use built in tools to change contrast and brightness and invert the image for a near real life experience. Over 100 detailed pictorial and text annotations superimposed on the images help better understanding. You can turn off the annotations to appreciate the findings better.\n\niCXR – The modern chest radiograph reference.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Works on both iPhone and iPad with a single purchase\n \n- No internet connection required\n\n- Largest chest radiograph library on the iphone \n\n- High quality zoomable radiographs\n\n- Zoomable text and pictorial annotations overlaid on the image that can be toggled\n\n- Multiple examples per condition\n\n- Links from text to appropriate images\n\n- Image manipulation tools that simulate a PACS work station\n\n- Manual to teach chest radiograph interpretation\n\n- Flash cards for quick reference"

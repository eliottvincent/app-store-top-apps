      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.\n \nSlow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:\n \nMOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.\n\nLIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

Throwback. Videos. Ever.\n• Create VHS-style retro videos of your kids that look like the ones from your childhood\n• The only VHS cam app you should ever consider to capture your 80s and 90s-themed parties\n• Shoot your own \"found footage\" movie and become a big Hollywood director like those other guys\n• Make your kids' incredibly boring school plays actually rad\n• Impress the new girl by using our app to convince her you built a time machine\n• Pretend like you lived through the rad 1980s using our app!\n\nWhat Rarevision VHS Can Do:\n\n• Realism: the ORIGINAL and BEST VHS cam app for simulating the glitches of old videotape recordings\n• Import videos and give them the VHS look\n• Make your own signature look using the old-school picture adjustment menu\n• Create your own animated titles for the ultimate in on-screen awesomeness\n• Change the on-screen date so people think you're way younger--or older--than you really are\n• Glitch the picture during recording using your finger or by shaking your device\n• Fake zoom feature dramatically enhances the cheese factor\n• Don't think we forgot to make things sound retro terrible (we didn't)\n• Up to 60p recording for a more accurate VHS video look (depends on device capability)\n• Widescreen recording option (but would you REALLY want to use it?)\n• HD video recording on iPhone 4s and newer devices (1080p requires iPhone 5 or better)\n\nFollow Rarevision:\nhttp://instagram.com/rarevision\nhttp://twitter.com/rarevision\nhttp://facebook.com/rarevisionfans\n\nRarevision is a US-based company, with all software development done in-house.\n\nCopyright © 2015-2021 Rarevision LLC.

Shoot brighter and clearer night videos with the power of NeuralCam’s AI Video Engine.\r\n\r\nUsing proprietary AI denoising, frame boosting and brightening technology NeuralCam NightVideo is the only dedicated video night mode camera app for iPhones. \r\n\r\nMULTIPLE CAPTURE SETTINGS:\r\n\r\n- Time-lapse - a Night Time-lapse mode, for devices that don’t have one built in. This mode doesn’t record sound and can handle even the lowest light situations, which combined with a faster playback, it generates a specific night mode time-lapse look. \r\n\r\n- Night - the default mode for shooting night videos. It uses a slightly longer exposure time, that combined with our denoising and frame interpolation algorithms generates a bright, clean and smooth night video. This is the mode to use for most night scenes. \r\n\r\n- Dusk - This mode is designed for semi-low light and indoor shots. It is similar to Day mode, shot at a high frame rate to maintain sharp subjects in high movement situations, but it also includes a bit of additional brightening.\r\n\r\n- Day - Is targeted at lower light day shots, or scenes with high dynamic range where the results of the default iPhone camera start to get too noisy. This mode contains no brightening, but because of the use of our AI denoising algorithm resulting videos have a cleaner, more pleasant look. It’s especially useful when used with the ultra wide camera, in the case of which noise can appear even in medium-lit indoor situations.\r\n\r\nGENTLE LIGHT- each of the modes can be combined with the “gentle light” feature, where the app turns on the flashlight, but at one of the lowest levels in order to keep the resulting video still \r\nnatural and avoid “blinding” people. Gentle Light can be used in totally dark scenes with subjects that are close enough to be illuminated.\r\n\r\nCUSTOM BRIGHTENING - allows changing the brightness level to generate night videos with different look and feel.\r\n\r\nON-DEVICE PROCESSING - all this processing runs in real-time on the iPhone, making full use of the NeuralEngine's power. This means that none of your videos leave the device and we can provide the same instant video capturing experience you’re used to with your default camera. \r\n\r\n\r\nSupported devices and settings:\r\n\r\niPhone XS/XR and newer (A12 chip or newer, with Neural Engine) - 4 recording modes, using all Neural Engine-based solutions.\r\niPhone 6s to iPhone 8 Plus (A11 chip or older, without Neural Engine) - NightMode TimeLapse mode fully supported. All other modes will have varied frame rate and performance, based on the iPhone model.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerms of Use: https://neural.cam/terms.html"

It is recalling the images you took 72 hours later, when 80% of your memory has blurred and faded away, will turn your short-term memory into long-term memory. Our team also has attempted to reproduce the in-the-moment experience of taking photos by eliminating the Instant Review feature found on conventional digital cameras and reducing 95 % of the conventional viewfinder feature, leaving only the bare minimum needed for taking shots.\n\n\"Gudak-dari Camera\", as its name suggests, refers to a time-worn and antique camera. Living in a digital generation where \"Un-do\" function is prevalent, we may have lost\n\nthe thrill of making new and conscious decisions. \"Patients is a virtue\" has faded its original value and people are getting used to selecting one palatable photo out of a myriad of photos. Amid this so-called \"digitalization\", we hope you to recall the thrill of making new choices by seizing the \"Gudak Moment\".\n\nGudak 3.2 Update has added a self-camera feature that allows you to shoot with a front camera as Gudak feels.\nExperience a new look of Gudak and a variety of emotional photos with front cameras as well as rear cameras. The theme will be updated further in the future.\n\n*The Lecoq film is only available in Korea.\n\nAlso, for those who feel that Gudak photos are dark, you can adjust the brightness of photos through the newly added ISO (based on world standard film sensitivity).\n\nA Gudakbook icon has been added to make Gudak photos a real album. Try to experience the feeling of those days through Gudakbook like the excitement I felt when printing the film camera. You can apply for Gudakbook through the print icon on the Printed Envelope Check page.\n\n\n[Explanation of Authority ]\n\nEssential access authority\n- Cameras: Camera access for photography\n- Save: External Storage Read/Write permissions for photoshooting, storing, and bringing in\n\nSelective access\n* You can use the service without agreeing to access rights.\n- Location: Location access to tag location information in pictures"

      "label": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera.

Select a photo from your camera roll (perhaps previously downloaded via AirDrop Google Drive)\n2. Add any notes or adjust settings if necessary then click 'Save'\n3. Choose your favourite option from the list of designs and it will be saved to your camera roll. \n\nThis app was inspired by the camera settings being shared in groups such as \"Learn to Light - An OCF Lighting Community\".\n\nFeatures coming soon:\n- iPad Support\n- Ability to edit presets\n\n*PRICING NOTE:* This is a once-off purchase. I will never ever add any in-app purchases, subscriptions, advertisements or anything like that. I'm a photographer trying to give back to the community that has shared so much and will keep this app updated with new features as quickly as I can. \n\nWays that don't work:\nThe app reads the EXIF metadata in your image which is not part of the image if you:\n- Use a screenshot of your photo\n- Use 'Save For Web' in photoshop (normal 'Save' works)"

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Google Cast enabled device (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your TV or gaming console. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Google Cast enabled device immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, like Vizio TV, Toshiba TV, Sony TV, Philips TV, Sharp TV, Chromecast 1+2+Ultra, Nexus Player, Nvidia Shield gaming console\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit.

Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google, Sony, Philips, Vizio, Sharp, Asus, Nvidia or one of their products and trademarks."

      "label": "Hey you! Yeah you! Shouldn't you be looking for Camera+ instead? Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots."

Combine it with our anti-shake for even clearer zoomed shots.\n \n+ Timer & Sound Capture\nA timer lets you set up timed group photos. You can set the interval between 2 and 300 seconds. Just tap the numbers when the timer pulls up to change the timing interval. You can even set it to repeat mode to capture photos automatically. The sound capture setting allows you to take photos by detecting noise to snap your photo. \n \n+ Full Screen Camera Button\nThe big photo button makes it easy to capture those photos without having to try and tap the tiny photo button, potentially missing that candid shot. Just tap the screen to take the photo.\n \n+ Prevent Blurry Photos with Anti-shake\nAnti-shake stabilization helps eliminate those blurry photos caused by excessive iPhone camera movement.\n \n+ Improve Photo Composition with Guides\nCamera guides help you compose and align photos based on known photographic principles.

Great for getting that action shot!\n \n+ Camera Manual\nLots of hints on the best way to take photos on your iPhone.

Also included is a full-screen slide show and the ability to pan and zoom around your photos. All photos are saved to the camera roll for quick syncing with your computer. \n \n+ Edit your photos.\nWhat photo app would be complete without the ability to edit your photos? We have over 20 great One Step filters! From Grunge, 70's style, Lomo and Cross Processing to Flash, Cinema, and Pseudo HDR we have got you covered!  If that's not enough we have 20 Adjustment Filters to give you fine control over hue, contrast, brightness, etc. Crop your photo to improve its composition.  We also have custom borders you can apply to any filter.  All filters can be stacked to give you nearly infinite options with the look of a photo.  Turn a drab photo into a work of art with a couple of clicks. \n \n+ Share your photos.\nNeed to get that photo or video onto Facebook, Twitter, Flickr?  We’ve got you covered!  Now post your photos and videos directly to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Picasa, MobileMe, Tumblr, YouTube, Clipboard and Email. You can even post to multiple services at once!\n\nIf photos are not showing in Album View.\nGo to your Settings icon on the iPhone.  Select General > Location Services.

      "label": "Bokeh Lens will turn your iPhone photos into DSLR-quality photos with creamy and pleasing bokeh!\n\nI love the portability of iPhone and being able to take snapshots everywhere. However, I miss the beautifully blurred background and bokeh effects that I can get using my DSLR camera. 'Bokeh Lens' for iOS will let you make the subject in your photo stand out by making the background blurred with natural-looking bokeh effects through the easy editing process.\n\nSelecting the foreground area (area to be remaining as sharp) is the key factor to get the best possible result. The selection tool in this app was designed and developed to meet your detail-oriented editing needs. It will display a loupe (magnifying glass) when you zoom-in and try to select/deselect area. The loupe is very handy because otherwise you can't see the spot you're touching as your finger is blocking your view.\n\nYou can also adjust bokeh level (aperture) to control how much your photo's background should be bokeh-blurred.\n\nHere are the reasons why you should get Bokeh Lens today:\n- Great result with bokeh-blurred background\n- Easy to use\n- Awesome selection tool\n- Delightful experience\n\nPlease enjoy the experience and don't hesitate to share your bokelicious photos!  \n\nResult image samples can be found in our Flickr group. Please join our Flickr group:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/bokehliciousapp\n\nand follow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/BokehLens\n\nUse hashtag #bokehlens when you share your photos,\n\nand give us your feedback at:\nhttp://bokehlens.uservoice.com"

It was named as one of the \"Best iOS App ever launched\" by TheNextWeb. \n\nLevitagram is the original and most advanced levitation photo editor in the App Store. It has a few **unique** and important features that none of other followers can provide:\n\n== Automatic Photo Alignment ==\nLevitagram has a unique automatic photo alignment algorithm so that you can just take the photos casually by hand without a tripod. Other apps require you either place phone on tripod or manually align(which is very hard and not usable), otherwise the result may look very fake. \n\n== Color matching between shots ==\nOnly Levitagram allows automatically or manually adjust the color, brightness, white balance, exposure etc between two different shots. Without this feature the result often looks very fake unless you have really nice light settings.\n\n== Flexible brush settings ==\nLevitagram uses a soft brush bigger than your fingertip without sacrificing performance, so that you can see what you are doing to make a precise edit. Levitagram is the only app support flexible brush shape settings to help you make pixel perfect levitation photos.\n\nLevitagram lets you create professional looking levitation photos in a snap! All you need is an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch. No professional cameras, computer or Photoshop skills required.\n\nFrom the latest 5.0 update, Levitagram not only let you shot and share amazing levitation photos, but also provides a community for levitation photography fans to share, discover and get inspired from each other."

A lens out of focus captured the light of a candle which resulted in a blurred image with octagonal-shaped diamonds dots.\n\nWithout losing the characteristics that made it a great success, we listened the opinions from our users and created an even better and more complete app! \n\nNow you can have even greater customization for your photos! \n\nIncrease, decrease, move, rotate, adjust the opacity of the effects and save at high resolution, are some of the most anticipated news!\n\nThere are now 121 effects!!! Including the new category NEON \n\nEasier to apply effects! And it looks even more beautiful and fresh! \n\nWe hope everyone can have again a unique experience with Lumiè!\n\n=====================\n\nUse #lumie tag on instagram\n\nfollow our inspirations instagram @lumieinspiration\n\n====================="

      "label": "Works great on iOS 11 and iPhone X! Thanks to users for the 1441 ***** 5 star reviews on iTunes! The essential Watermarking App for Professionals, Business and Personal Use. Easily, secure and protect your photos with a text, graphic, signature or QR watermark. Adding a visible watermark to a photo displays it is created and owned by you. Watermarking is increasingly important and is like signing your name to an image. A watermark subtly displays, no matter where your photo goes, that it's yours. Watermarking can also be used to add your email, url, a personal message or fun graphics to any photo or Pokemon Go screenshot.\n\n\"It's by far the best watermarking App I've seen to date on iOS.\"\n- Terry White, review on bestappsite.com\n\nVideo Review by the Daily App Show:\nhttp://dailyappshow.com/iwatermark\n\nThanks to all iWatermark users for the great reviews, feedback and suggestions. \n\niWatermark, is the only watermarking tool available for all 4 platforms iPhone/iPad, Mac and Windows. iWatermark is the most popular professional watermarking tool for photos.\n\nSocial media sharing at full resolution to Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Twitter, Camera Album, Clipboard or Email (3 resolution options).\n\nFeatures\n\n  * Touch gestures.\n     ** Click to move the watermark location.\n     ** Pinch/zoom to expand/contract the size of the watermark. \n     ** Two fingers at once to rotate the watermark to any angle.\n  * Batch processing (all at once) or sequential.\n  * Easily adjust the watermarks scale, opacity, font, color, size, position and angle.\n  * Create your own subtle text or graphic watermarks or select from the included example watermarks (both text and graphics).\n  * Included examples are both text (names, dates, tag data, etc.) and graphic (signatures, logos, etc.) watermarks which can be used immediately. \n  * 162 fonts for your text watermarks 112 + 50 iOS fonts.\n  * Displays each font.\n  * 34 high-res watermarks.\n  * Import your own graphic watermarks by sending yourself an email with attached graphic.\n  * One button import of your signature for use as a watermark.\n  * Complete and easy to understand manual.\n  * Create a QR watermark which is like a barcode. QR codes can contain up to 4000 chars of information. QR codes can then be read with a scanner or smartphone with the right app revealing the info you encoded. \n\nWhy Watermark?\n\nDigitally sign your photos/artwork with iWatermark to claim, secure and maintain your intellectual property and reputation.\n\n- Photos go viral then they fly off globally. Watermark with name, email or url so your photo has a visible and legal connection to you.\n- Build your company brand, by having your company logo on all your images.\n- Promote your company, name and website by using QR codes as watermarks.\n- Avoid the surprise of seeing your photos and/or artwork elsewhere on the web or in an ad.\n- Avoid the conflicts, costly litigation and headaches from plagiarists who claim they didn't know that you created it.\n- Avoid intellectual property (IP) squabbles.\n\nQ:I want to stamp my signature as my watermark. How do I add my graphic signature like the examples, Picasso, Ben Franklin, etc.? \nA:Use our signature tool or make the .png graphics on your computer, email it to yourself, open the email on your iOS device and save to your photo album. In iWatermark create a graphic watermark and choose the graphic from your photo album to add it as a new watermark.\n\nQ:Will it work with Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus?\nA:Yes\n\nSee the manual for more details:\nhttp://www.plumamazing.com/iphone/iwatermark-iphone/iwatermarkhelp/\n\nIMPORTANT: The signatures of John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Galileo are just examples of graphic watermarks. They are the real signatures of these historic people. They are there as examples to show what is possible. We recommend you create your own signature, logo or QR code watermarks.\n\nContact us if you need help or have a suggestion."

Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  \n\nOK!  Now what??\n\nDo you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do! Enable manual mode; set the focus to infinity; change the temperature to a certain number; change the ISO between certain values; change the shutter speed to something else....wait what...?\n\nDon't worry, this app does all of that for you so all you have to do is find those lights.  ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!\n\nWorth a shot !

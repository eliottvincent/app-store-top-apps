      "label": "A simple tool for businesses to talk to their customers. — WhatsApp Business from Meta\n\nWhatsApp Business enables you to have a business presence on WhatsApp, communicate more efficiently with your customers, and help you grow your business.\n\nIf you have separate business and personal phone numbers, you can have both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger installed on the same phone, and register them with different numbers.\n\nIn addition to the features available in WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business includes:\n\n• BUSINESS PROFILE: Create a profile for your business to help your customers find valuable information — like your website, location, or contact information.\n\n• BUSINESS MESSAGING TOOLS: Be more responsive to your customers by using Away messages to indicate that you're away.\n\n• LANDLINE/FIXED NUMBER SUPPORT: You can use WhatsApp Business with a landline (or fixed) phone number and your customers can message you on that number. During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

He describes one of his pickup experiences below: “While picking up two diffusers, one customer noticed that our store smelled great and asked what product we were using. On top of their Wish Pickup order, they ended up buying 6 items including the scent sachets we use in our store, essential oils for the Wish diffusers, and some items that were near checkout!”\n\nReach new users\nFrom Miami to Berlin to Paris, Wish has millions of users all around the world. Gain new customers near your area.\n\nPartner with Wish Local to grow your business.\nJoining is easy and free!

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

It provides the same user- friendly experience that’s earned BBM millions of fans worldwide – with the end-to-end security enterprise needs. \n\nBBM Enterprise allows users to take advantage of the speed, reliability and privacy of BBM for faster communication, collaboration and decision making while providing security conscious organizations enhanced security over corporate data.\nBBM Enterprise is the ideal business communication tool because it is mobile and immediate. Unlike enterprise IM tools that were originally designed for use on the desktop, BBM Enterprise offers a truly mobile experience, on a variety of devices.\nWith BBM Enterprise, you only need one app to cover your mobile messaging and collaboration needs. Users know when their colleagues have received and read messages, so they can collaborate with confidence, in real-time. One-to-one chats, group discussions and file sharing all happen with the protection required by security-focused organizations – and all with an immediacy and accountability that’s hard to achieve through any other communication channel. \n\nBBM Enterprise uses a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic library and leverages BlackBerry’s secure infrastructure, trusted by security-conscious and regulated organizations around the world, to protect data while it’s in transit and at rest.  All the added security offered by BBM Enterprise happens in the background, so there’s no impact on the BBM user experience.\n\n\nTo use BBM Enterprise for personal use, you can buy an auto-renewable subscription from within the app. The BBM Enterprise auto-renewable subscription provides access to use the app for enhanced secure communication for 6 months with a 1 year free trial.  Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the end of the free trial period. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase.\nTerms of Service: https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/legal/blackberry-messenger"

Later, saving scans to CD’s was considered, as was scanning on a printer’s flatbed. Then a few years ago I learned of Scanner SE and have never looked back! Scanner SE does an excellent job of scanning these many hundreds of letters quickly and efficiently—in any setting! Its portability (on my phone) is high on my list of recommendations. Over the few years I have used it, Scanner SE has continued to improve its features and make scanning even more convenient. It has made my job of scanning and saving to Google Drive infinitely easier, and for that I much appreciate it.\"\n-- Rachel Maddow Fan\n\n---\nKEY FEATURES\n* Scan documents with a single page, or a batch of pages like an entire book with single/multi-page scan mode with tutorials all the way;\n* Scan photos as documents from Photo Album;\n* Automatically recognize documents by intelligent border detection;\n* Customize page size when exporting documents;\n* Professional filters, including Color, Black & White, Photo, Grayscale;\n* Recognize every word of the documents with AI OCR technology and translate them into lots of languages as you want;\n* Share documents as PDF, JPG by faxing or emailing them, or upload them to Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, OneDrive, Evernote, iCloud Drive;\n* Auto upload scanned documents onto cloud drives;\n\n---\nWHY SCANNER SE?\n* Customizable\nBetter than most similar apps, re-editing saved documents is empowered so that you can move pages, replace pages with new ones, or even merge two documents into one.\n* Organized\nAll scanned documents or files can be organized in any way as you like.

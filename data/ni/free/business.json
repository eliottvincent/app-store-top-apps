      "label": "A simple tool for businesses to talk to their customers. — WhatsApp Business from Meta\n\nWhatsApp Business enables you to have a business presence on WhatsApp, communicate more efficiently with your customers, and help you grow your business.\n\nIf you have separate business and personal phone numbers, you can have both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger installed on the same phone, and register them with different numbers.\n\nIn addition to the features available in WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business includes:\n\n• BUSINESS PROFILE: Create a profile for your business to help your customers find valuable information — like your website, location, or contact information.\n\n• BUSINESS MESSAGING TOOLS: Be more responsive to your customers by using Away messages to indicate that you're away.\n\n• LANDLINE/FIXED NUMBER SUPPORT: You can use WhatsApp Business with a landline (or fixed) phone number and your customers can message you on that number. During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

The Calabrio WFM MyTime app is compatible with Cloud and On-Premise installations, to allow users to check and manage their schedules from anywhere at any time.  \n\nUsers can view their schedule day by day, week by week or month by month. Using clear and simple pages, users can clearly see all activities during a day, when they are scheduled for lunch, what time they finish, what overtime they are working. It’s also possible to view team members’ schedules, allowing easy coordination for meetings and other activities.\n\nUsers can easily notify any absence due to sickness, request vacation, and check the status of a request. Advanced, but simple to use features, also include the setting of availability and shift trades. Setting availability is a great feature for many agents, but especially for part time workers such as students, who need to be able to vary their work times. Through a powerful shift trading functionality users can quickly adapt working times with colleagues to suit their own lifestyle, all with a few simple finger touches. A great feature for agents, and a huge time saver for their supervisors. Naturally notifications and messages can be viewed so you can quickly know of any changes.\n\nPlease Note: A customer’s IT department must allow agents to have access to MyTime from the Internet before this app may be used."

You have the power to make edits to your ecommerce store theme, like adding announcement banners, posting blog posts, and more, all from your smartphone. \n\nReview from eCommerce News HQ\n“Taking the top eCommerce platform and translating it into a mobile experience can be challenging, but it seems as if Shopify has nailed this attempt. The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

These apps can display content, take notes, create forms, capture photos, signatures and GPS, scan bar codes, and generate workflows for a wide variety of business scenarios. You can also build web apps and chatbots.\n\nAppSheet uses data from your cloud storage -- Google Sheets, Excel on Office365, Dropbox or Box, Smartsheet, SalesForce, and a variety of databases (SQLServer, mySQL, Postgres, and DynamoDB). You can create an app in minutes and enhance it to create rich custom apps for your team, business, or enterprise. Check review sites like Capterra to learn how AppSheet’s modern technology platform outpaces older low-code solutions like PowerApps, Salesforce1, and App Maker. \n\nAppSheet is an ideal solution for many business, including those in property management, agriculture, supply chain, operations, salesforce management, education and more. Here are just a few scenarios:\n\nWORKING WITH REMOTE TEAMS\nApps built with AppSheet can help a remote team work with centralized data saved in spreadsheets (eg: in Google Drive, Box, or Droppox) or SQL databases. \n\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nMillions of people manage projects using Google Sheets, Excel, and Smartsheets. Project managers can build apps with AppSheet to display and share project data through a mobile device with other team members and stakeholders. Keep data centralized in a core spreadsheet and share only the parts that their audience needs to see. No more managing dozens of files that go back and forth via email!\n\nEDUCATION\nManage study plans, school rosters, grading, and group work by creating a custom app with charts, maps, text summaries and image galleries. Share the app securely with students and colleagues.\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT:\nKeep track of your customer pipeline on a Google Sheet but get the benefits of a streamlined custom mobile app using AppSheet. You can also interact with your data in new ways like building maps from your data, calling or messaging to telephone numbers, sending emails to contacts, and building catalogs using image galleries."

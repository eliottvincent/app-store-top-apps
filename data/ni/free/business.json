During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

      "label": "The field app for Autodesk Build, Autodesk BIM Collaborate, and Autodesk Docs\n\nPlanGrid Build is the best-in-class construction management app for Autodesk Construction Cloud. Simple automation and smart connections between tools make it easy for the more than 2.5 million construction projects across 143 countries to deliver quality projects on time and under budget.\n\nPlanGrid Build brings Autodesk Build, Autodesk BIM Collaborate, Autodesk Docs, Revit, Navisworks, and AutoCAD to the field with collaboration tools and project data available from anywhere.\n\nPlanGrid Build is made for the project team, like…\n\n• the superintendent managing the quality of work on site\n• the project manager tracking progress in real-time\n• the BIM team identifying issues ahead of installation\n• the foreman implementing new safety programs\n• the architect doing a site walk\n• and the owner, who uses data from project start to daily operations, to improve the efficiency of the next project.\n\nHere’s how we do it.\n\nCOLLABORATION\n+ Issues\nTrack issues, from design to handover, all in one place. Resolve issues faster by adding due dates, responsible parties, and easily reference photos, associated files, and RFIs.\n\n+ Schedule\nKeep projects on track with a centralized schedule. View the schedule by different timespans or filter by critical items, review predecessor and successor dependencies, and assess schedule suggestions, all from your mobile device.\n\n+ Forms\nGather critical information with forms that adapt to project requirements. Build a comprehensive safety program or track daily checklists.\n\n+ Assets\nEasily manage the lifecycle of project assets from design through commissioning and handover. Assets are tracked, stored, and connected to other workflows in the app.\n\n+ Meetings\nStay ahead of the next meeting by creating meetings or meeting agenda items. Link to references like issues, models, RFIs, or photos. Check the status of outstanding items and follow up, all from the field.\n\nFILE MANAGEMENT\n+ Sheets\nQuickly access the latest drawings and shared plans with quick downloads and dynamic search. Compare, share, and markup sheets directly from the field to take the guesswork out of installation.\n\n+ Models\nMake critical decisions faster with access to 3D models in the field. View installation details and effortlessly navigate single or multi-trade models to build with confidence. (Supports RVT, DWG, NWC, IFC, NWD)\n\nQUALITY \n + RFIs\nReduce the risk of data loss with seamless RFI management. Connect RFIs across the project lifecycle to cut down on duplicate work. Build flexibility into your workflows with the custom data fields.\n\n+ Submittals\nKeep all relevant submittal information on hand. With search, quickly find the necessary submittal to view progress and next steps. Add references to link submittals to workflows throughout the project.\n\n+ Photos\nUse photos to track progress and add references to issues, RFIs, schedule adjustments, and more. With autotags and location data, quickly find the photo you need.\n\nWe’ve made big moves to support a changing industry, and our customers agree:\n\n\"The ability to access 3D models from the field eliminates confusion and allows us to come to a real-time resolution for any issues onsite. This capability reduces risk and provides cost and time savings while ensuring we deliver high-quality projects to our clients.\"\nBriana Mitchell, Project Manager, Boldt Company\n\n\"We have about 460 field employees and for them to access documents in real-time directly on their iPhone or their iPad is priceless.\"\nKen Mabe, Director of Field Operations, Eckardt Group\n\n\"I’m excited about being able to effortlessly tag a snippet from a drawing onto an RFI and immediately assign responsibilities and track how the project team interacts with a particular issue or RFI. The ability to track an issue’s progression in real-time helps us manage any roadblocks immediately.\"\nAmy Kozlowski​, Project Manager,​ Herrero Builders"

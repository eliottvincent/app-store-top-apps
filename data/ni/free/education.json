      "label": "WHAT DOES SPEECH BLUBS OFFER?\n\nSpeech Blubs is a voice-controlled speech therapy app designed to help your child learn new sounds and words, and to practice speaking in a stimulating, educational environment. \n\n**FEATURED IN** Autism Parenting Magazine, Brisbane Kids, Speech Chick Therapy, Beautiful Speech Life, and The Speech Teacher. Awarded the Social Impact Award and supported by the Facebook Start Program, and winner of the “Safe for Children” certificate, the Mom’s Choice Award, the Parent’s Picks 2020 Award Winner, and techozens.com’s “Best and Trusted Speech Therapy App for Kids.\n\nWHY LEARN WITH SPEECH BLUBS?\nOur app was created with speech therapists, teachers, & parents, and uses video modeling for effective speech development. Our apps have zero ads and no flashy features, thus providing a safe and non-intrusive learning experience. We use ABA therapy-inspired positive reinforcement that rewards kids with fun games and stickers for trying. Having the app at your fingertips makes it easy to practice in a routine that suits you, and helps avoid stressful disruptions that can upset your child.\nOur apps use multiple child and platform support, so with one sign-in ALL of your kids can use the app, no matter if it's on your device, a partner’s, or grandparents’. One sign-in also includes our new reading app READING BLUBS – designed with over 200 teachers and literacy experts.\nYou can now get access to language versions in US and UK English, Spanish, French, & (Brazilian) Portuguese. \n\nKEY FEATURES:\nParents’ Academy:\nA newly-added parent section provides access to an ever-growing content library of 350+ articles on parenting, homeschooling, education, speech therapy, and more. All written by 20+ speech and teaching professionals. Also, check out our practical video tips!\n\n\nKids’ area:\nThere are over 1500+ exercises, activities, videos, mini-games, and dozens of NEW face filters. We have lions, firefighters, monkeys, giraffes, hats, glasses, and more. Also, the app’s look and feel is even more child-friendly and engaging. There are some new animal characters to guide and motivate kids through exercises to achieve learning goals and make learning fun!\nChoose from 28 fun sections: Early Sounds, When I Grow Up, Get into Shapes, Living Colors, Yummy Time, This Is My Body, Mouth Gym, Animal Kingdom, Ride Your Wheels, Sing-Along, and many more!\n\nSCIENTIFICALLY-PROVEN LEARNING TECHNIQUES\nSpeech Blubs uses video modeling for immersive learning, where children observe their peers as “teachers'' on video. When children watch their peers in real-time, their MIRROR NEURONS fire up! This scientifically proven and effective approach was confirmed in a UCLA study published by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and showed that kids learn faster and better when learning from other kids.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION, PRICING, & TERMS\nSpeech Blubs starts with a 7-day free trial. You get a free personalized report with tips & tricks, plus unlimited access to all the activities to try our app. Your subscription automatically renews unless the auto-renew feature is turned off at least 24 hrs. before the end of the current period.

APRENDIZAJE DE LA GRAMÁTICA con reglas bien ilustrativas\n2. ENTRENADOR para reforzar el vocabulario y las reglas\n3. MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO con ayuda de asociaciones\n4. COMPRENSIÓN AUDITIVA para aprender a entender el lenguaje oral\n5. CHECKPONTS para controlar lo aprendido y subsanar lagunas\n6. ¡PRÁCTICAS INUSUALES! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado para consolidar los conocimientos\n\nSimpler es ideal para principiantes. Con su ayuda puede aprender inglés desde cero. Asimismo puede hacer una prueba de nivel y empezar a estudiar a partir de cualquier nivel\n\n=====================\n\n¿POR QUÉ SIMPLER ES EL MÉTODO MÁS RÁPIDO Y EFICAZ DE APRENDER INGLÉS?\n\n1. Hemos creado el SISTEMA DE ENSEÑANZA DE LA GRAMÁTICA más claro y sencillo, conveniente a los principiantes. No le hace falta adentrarse en los mínimos detalles de la gramática inglesa, ni leer libros de texto. Descompusimos el inglés en átomos, seleccionamos solo la info más relevante, la reconstituimos y convertimos en estructuras fáciles e inteligibles. Cada regla gramatical del curso autodidacta Simpler es una instrucción corta que enseguida se refuerza con preguntas y prácticas.\n\n2. Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado. Le harán pensar en inglés, con ellas podrá ampliar su vocabulario y mejorar la destreza oral.\n\n6. ¡La eficacia está en la regularidad! Para mantener su motivación a aprender inglés, hacemos constancia de su TRABAJO A TODO RITMO. ¡Estudie todos los días y los resultados no se harán esperar!\n\n7. ¡Gane ESTRELLAS, desbloquee lecciones, trabaje a destajo y reciba regalos!\n\n==========================\n\nOPCIONES DE USO DEL CURSO AUTODIDACTA DE INGLÉS SIMPLER\n• La suscripción Premium le permite aprender inglés accediendo a todo el funcional de la app.\n• Después de confirmar la compra, el cargo se realizará desde su cuenta iTunes. \n• La suscripción se renovará automáticamente a no ser desactivada 24 horas antes del vencimiento del periodo actual.

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

      "label": "Welcome to \"Lila's World\" \n\nPlay as Lila while she visits her Grandma's house for the summer. There are a lot of things to discover all throughout this mystery manor in which Grandma lives. Explore the house, read a book in the library or have a tea party in the living room. Play the piano in the Music room or Cook almost any dish you can think of in the Kitchen. While you explore, don’t forget to look for the many secrets of the house. Now what could Grandma be hiding?\n\nNot only can you play in Grandma's house but you can draw and create your own worlds too. Use real paper and colors to draw new characters, scenes, food, objects and a lot more. \n\nBrowse all the different worlds created by all the imaginative kids out there. The possibilities are endless. \n\nMaybe you can help Lila setup her cousin Ro's birthday party, or go to the park for a picnic with her friends. \n\nMaybe you can sail the oceans on a pirate ship, or just have fun day at the beach with your family.\n\nYou can also play with your own drawn characters in the real world in the AR mode. Just watch as your own drawings come to life. It’s like Magic!\n\nMake your own pretend play world!\n\nPLAY:\nIn “Lila’s Word” there are no rules and no goals. Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

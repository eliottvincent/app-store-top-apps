Graded entirely on your pronunciation, our app makes language learning fresh and fun.\n\nLearn to speak Spanish, French, German and English like a native speaker. Unlike traditional language learning apps, that teach you ‘classroom’ speak, Univoice teaches you to speak a new language as it’s spoken in the real world, including idioms and slang words.\n\nJust load up the app, select the language and genre of music that suits your mood and start singing along with the artist.

Aunque la presentación es académica, también se basa en la iluminación del Espíritu Santo.\n\nEste canal ofrece al espectador de habla hispana la oportunidad de escuchar una muestra de lo que los estudiantes de nuestro Instituto escuchan cada día en hebreo.\n\nEl Dr. Baruch es escuchado en todo Israel cada semana en el programa de televisión israelí P'dut L'amo.

      "label": "Welcome to \"Lila's World\" \n\nPlay as Lila while she visits her Grandma's house for the summer. There are a lot of things to discover all throughout this mystery manor in which Grandma lives. Explore the house, read a book in the library or have a tea party in the living room. Play the piano in the Music room or Cook almost any dish you can think of in the Kitchen. While you explore, don’t forget to look for the many secrets of the house. Now what could Grandma be hiding?\n\nNot only can you play in Grandma's house but you can draw and create your own worlds too. Use real paper and colors to draw new characters, scenes, food, objects and a lot more. \n\nBrowse all the different worlds created by all the imaginative kids out there. The possibilities are endless. \n\nMaybe you can help Lila setup her cousin Ro's birthday party, or go to the park for a picnic with her friends. \n\nMaybe you can sail the oceans on a pirate ship, or just have fun day at the beach with your family.\n\nYou can also play with your own drawn characters in the real world in the AR mode. Just watch as your own drawings come to life. It’s like Magic!\n\nMake your own pretend play world!\n\nPLAY:\nIn “Lila’s Word” there are no rules and no goals. Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

There is no guessing as to how to pronounce the words. And if the app is talking too quickly for you, simply tap the snail/turtle icon to hear the words more slowly. Listen to pronunciation recorded by native speaker and then record and play back your own voice to practice your foreign language speaking skills!\n\nWhen traveling to foreign countries, make sure you bring the app with you! Ideally you listen to a phrase and repeat it, but if your accent is terrible, you can play the voice on the app to local people (e.g., a waiter or store clerk). Language barrier while travelling abroad will no longer exist!\n\n--- FEATURES ---\n\n1. Many useful foreign phrases & words\n2. Pronunciation recorded by native speaker\n3.

      "label": "Want a 99% chance of passing your DMV Permit Test?  With DMV WRITTEN TEST you get state-specific DMV practice tests that are the same as the real test.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n• No Need for the Driver's Manual:  We provide you with the most up-to-date questions based on the current version of your state's official driver's handbook.  Don't be surprised with outdated test questions. We cover every DMV, DDS, BMV, MVA, RMV, DOR, MVC, MVD, DOT, DOL in the country.\n• Take Comprehensive Practice Tests:  Our tests cover every section of the driver's manual so no matter what state you're in, you'll be well prepared.  Go through our practice tests and when you take the real thing, it will seem easy.\n• Pass the DMV Test:  Once you've practiced enough and are passing the practice exams, you should be ready to make an appointment with the DMV.  With a 99% chance of passing, you'll be ready to pass the test the first time!\n\nPRACTICE DMV TESTS MAKE YOU PASS FASTER\nA whopping 5 out of 10 people fail the DMV test the first time they take it, but the people that use DMV Written Test see a 99% pass rate.  We also let you take every sample DMV permit test and DMV license test as many times as needed so you can be sure you're ready for the real thing.\n\nWHY CHOOSE DMV WRITTEN TEST?\n• State-Specific Tests:  Because each state has different driving laws and restrictions, we've tailored our tests to each specific state.  This isn't one of those generic DMV practice tests.  \n• Accurate & Up-to-Date:  We constantly monitor the newest versions of your state's official driving handbook and traffic laws and then update our test questions accordingly.  They are always accurate and up to date.\n• The Same Content:  Since we take our facts directly from the handbooks, it allows us to create practice test questions that are very similar, if not identical, to the questions found on the actual driver's license test.\n\nWHY WE’RE SO EFFECTIVE\n• Know what to expect:  Our tests have the same number of questions and the same passing score requirements as the actual tests so you'll know what to expect.\n• Feel confident as you walk into the DMV:  You've seen it all before and know what's coming.  You got this!\n• Stay motivated to study:  With our practice tests you'll learn as you go and see your own progress in real time.\n\nHAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?\nIf you have any questions, want to report a bug, or notice any errors, feel free to reach out to us."

      "label": "Best Coloring App\n\n\nAs parents, we know how important it is to have the right applications installed for our kids to use. Before we started working on Kids Coloring Book, we were using many different applications but nothing we found fully met our expectations. Our application helps kids develop motor skills and learn color combinations. It can also help your kids learn words such as animal names.\n\n\nInteractive Kids Coloring Book is an application that works fast! It will please kids of all ages, thanks to the richness of colors which magically appear at the touch of the screen. When you paint a line, there is no delay. When you are filling in shapes, they fill right up to the lines you have just painted and those features work just as well on the many pre-loaded pictures and drawings available. You can easily erase your progress at any time if you need to correct something. You can also save a picture and continue working on it at a later time.\n\n\nPlease remember to be a responsible parent. You should not overuse this app. Kids love games and it can keep them busy all day long.\n\nAs parents we know that it is tempting to keep your child busy all day, however, there are better ways:\n\n- Spend some time together with your child coloring, make a card and email email it to your family.\n\n- Discuss with your kid what the image represents, what kind of animal it is, where it lives, etc.\n\n- Most of all,have lots of fun together with your toddler with this creative colorings\n\n- Create your own coloring pages and pictures\n\n- Draw any shapes your toddler loves and let your child paint them\n\n- You can teach your child to write letters"

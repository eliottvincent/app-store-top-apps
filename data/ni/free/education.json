Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado.

Moreover, they are well versed in breaking down multifaceted chronicles and complex concepts in an easily digestible manner, at the same time entirely relevant to the original book, and to your personal growth and professional development!\nEach book summary or microbook as we like to call it, is written in a way that they can be read and listened to entirely independently of the book they summarize. \nIn other words, they are not just a haphazard list of key insights and highlights, but meaningful, self-sufficient accounts connecting the ideas in question in engrossing narratives by way of arguments, anecdotes and original quotes.\n\n_________________________\nWHY 12min?\n\nAt 12min, we take pride in providing not just a well structured and easily digestible synopsis of more than 2500+ nonfiction titles, but also a comprehensive and actionable overview of the key insights of the book in question.\nNot sure what you want to read?

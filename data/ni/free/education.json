Originally called the 'Magic Cube'.\n\nTHE METHOD\nReally easy to learn method for solving the Rubik’s cube taught in a fun and easy way even for a baby.\nThis method consists in 7 easy movements: White Cross, Middle Layer, Yellow Cross Position, Yellow Cross Orientation, Position Corners and Final Movement.\n\nThe method’s great advantage is its simplicity. As an example the Final Movement only needs 4 rotations and not the usual 10 or 12 that no one can remember.\n\nThe cube has 6 faces with 6 colors and 26 pieces:\nCenter: Pieces with 1 color located in each face’s center. It tells us the cube’s face’s color.\nCorner: Pieces with 3 colors located in the cube’s corners. There are 8 in total.\nBorder: Pieces with 2 colors located between cube corners. There are 12 in total.\n\nThe movement’s sequences are explained step by step. In each step you can see which face you have to rotate and a title. Try to remember these titles and the rotation comes alone.\n\nYour suggestions are more than welcome at info@fithx.com.\nSubject: Solve The Cube\nPlease tell us the case and the page number in the message."

Your baby may say their first word from as early as 4 to 6 months, and by the time they’re 18 months, they may even be able to string a simple sentence of two or three words.\n\nResearch has shown that taking a couple of minutes a day to read or play with your baby, encouraging them to repeat some words, will dramatically increase their language skills, as well as strengthen your emotional bonds.\n\n\nMy First Words is an attractive puzzle for children +1 years old, developed to teach them how to say the name of common objects that surround them.\n\nThe game includes 14 boards with different themes containing more than 120 words of their environment to learn. It also includes some advanced words to encourage the development of the children who are already speaking.\n\n\nThis game has been specifically designed to improve the following areas:\n\n- Hand-eye coordination\n- Concentration\n- Classification of objects\n- Visual perception\n- Vocabulary\n\nMy First Words features voices in Spanish, Portuguese and English, so if your baby has already learned all the words, encourage him or her to learn languages!\n\n\nPlayToddlers’ games encompass different areas of toddler’s personal growth, and have been specifically designed to be used by babies, with a simple and attractive interface that allows them to use the application by themselves, improving their development and self-esteem."

      "label": "Pronouns are an especially important and interesting part of speech. They point to a face, but they do not name it. Therefore, pronouns refer to English grammar and this topic cannot be ignored if you want to write and speak English fluently. Since there is no gender category in English, pronouns very often act as gender determinants. Now that you have realized the importance of this topic, you can start learning.\r\nAt first glance, the topic of pronouns in English seems simple, but there are some subtleties that need to be understood. For easy memorization of the use of pronouns in English, we have created our application.\r\nThere are many ways to learn English and English pronouns. We will use one of the most effective ways - learning English pronouns by reading texts and books.\r\nOur application offers you a large selection of texts and books on any topic. You can only read what you really like! Thus, you not only learn pronouns, but also get interesting information or read books in the original.\r\nBefore starting the training, you have the opportunity to choose exactly the type of pronouns that you want to learn (personal, reflexive, etc.). You can also learn all pronouns at once. Then you must choose a text or a book. Our algorithm will cut pronouns from the text. Now you need to carefully read the sentences and insert the correct pronouns. Thanks to the context, you can not only theoretically use the correct pronouns. Based on the surrounding words, you will understand why this or that pronoun is used in this case. This way of learning will help you replenish your vocabulary and quickly start using the learned pronouns and constructions in speech or writing.\r\nOur app also contains a short course on the grammar of the use of English pronouns. English grammar is divided by the type of pronouns and it will be convenient for you to find exactly what you need. The information is presented there briefly, but succinctly enough for you to systematize your knowledge.\r\nYou can use our app for self-study English or as an addition to your English textbooks. Regardless of your language level, our application will be useful and comfortable to use. Even if you are just starting to learn English pronouns or have an advanced level of English, you can easily read texts and books.\r\nSpend your free time with benefit and use our application, reading books improving your knowledge!"

Dinosaur Firetruck combines fun puzzles, teaching your child about water physics in an entertaining way. Be the hero, save the dinosaurs and earn stars!\n\nChildren will head to the forests, mines, countryside, islands, machine factory and chemical factory with a firetruck and help the dinosaurs! Experience the fun of Flow Physics during the explorations.\n\nYou can use the power of water to do more than put out fires.

Or blast chemicals to destroy the planks that are about to fall in and help the dinosaurs out!\n\nYou’ll have to use your thinking caps to solve the puzzles. Some of the fires are hard to reach so the angle of your fire hose is critical; you might even have to shoot the water upwards and let the water fall down to put out the flame. And sometimes you’ll have to use the collision between the water and other obstacles to change the direction of the water flow to save the dinosaurs in danger.\n\nNow jump into the firetruck and let's race to the rescue!\n\nFeatures\n• Up to 30 unique levels that bring fun challenges\n• Travel to 6 islands with rich game scenes: mine, old forests, pastoral windmill, sunshine islands, machine factory and chemical factory\n• 6 villains' magical driving tools:  Drilling truck,  long-legged octopus truck, fiery dragon truck,  flame airship, clockwork machine, spider-shaped truck\n• Presents the real physical world through an entertaining game\n• Game can be played without the Internet\n• No third-party advertising\n\nParents, this game will bring smiles of joy as your child solves the challenges.

      "label": "Application Saint-faustina.org (Faustyna.pl) covers key topics connected with St. Faustina, devotion to the Divine Mercy in the forms handed on to her by Jesus, daily thoughts from her “Diary,” and information about the capital of devotion to Divine Mercy:  Shrine in Cracow-Łagiewniki.  Moreover, it also provides current news (text and photo), access to live streaming from the Chapel of the Miraculous Image of Merciful Jesus as well as quick information about ongoing works at the Łagiewniki Shrine.\n\nThrough this app, the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, together with many co-workers, shares the gift of the message of Divine Mercy that Jesus gives to the whole world through St. Faustina. St. John Paul II calling St. Faustina’s spiritual wealth and the message of mercy “God’s gift for our times,” passes on this gift to the Church and the world of the Third Millennium. Through this gift, Jesus reminds us about the biblical truth about the merciful love of God for every man and invites us all to proclaim it with new vigor by the witness of life, deeds, words and prayer. The new forms of devotion to Divine Mercy that Jesus gave form part of this message. These are: the Image of Christ with the signature: Jesus, I trust in You, Divine Mercy Sunday which falls on the first Sunday after Easter, Chaplet of Divine Mercy, Hour of Mercy (3:00 PM) and Spreading devotion to Divine Mercy. Great promises are attached to each one of them provided that they are practiced in the spirit of trust in God (fulfillment of His will) and mercy toward neighbor.\n\nWith the death of St. Faustina, God as it were laid down this gift of the message of Mercy at the Shrine in Cracow-Łagiewniki. This is why St. John Paul II called this place the capital of devotion to Divine Mercy. From this place, the message goes out to the entire world carried by modern apostles of Divine Mercy, today reaching many millions. These modern apostles make up the Apostolic Movement of Divine Mercy (this is that new congregation, which Jesus wanted established): various congregations, cloistered and active, male and female, associations, confraternities, apostolates and people who individually undertake St. Faustina’s mission of proclaiming and imploring God’s mercy for the world. This spark needs to be lighted by the grace of God, said John Paul II at the Łagiewniki Shrine, This fire of mercy needs to be passed on to the world. In the mercy of God the world will find peace and mankind will find happiness!"

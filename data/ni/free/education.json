Graded entirely on your pronunciation, our app makes language learning fresh and fun.\n\nLearn to speak Spanish, French, German and English like a native speaker. Unlike traditional language learning apps, that teach you ‘classroom’ speak, Univoice teaches you to speak a new language as it’s spoken in the real world, including idioms and slang words.\n\nJust load up the app, select the language and genre of music that suits your mood and start singing along with the artist. As you sing or speak, you can see the translation of the lyrics back into your native language.\n\nWe’ll grade you on your pronunciation, not your pitch or tone, so you can see how well you’ve done and how you improve over time!\n\nLong gone are the days of memorizing long vocabulary lists, repeating the same keywords and phrases, or reading pages of grammar rules. Now you can learn through song – scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn how to speak a new language!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nHow does the Univoice app work?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**No singing skill required! We grade only on pronunciation**\n• Pick from Spanish, French, German, and English\n• Choose from a wide range of 30+ music genres\n• Sing (or speak) with the artist in the language you’re learning\n• Follow the translation into your native language as you speak\n• Familiarize yourself with idioms & slang words you won’t find in a textbook\n• Expand your vocabulary & learn new phrases the fun way... through music!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat motivates Univoicers to learn a new language?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n• Becoming a global citizen & raising globally-minded children\n• Connecting with others in a more meaningful, organic way\n• Staying tightly connected to heritage & strengthening family ties\n• Communicating more fluidly with coworkers, clients, patients\n• Learning to speak (and sing) a dream language like a native\n• Immersing oneself in the culture, while learning the language\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat subscription plans does Univoice offer?\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAll app users will receive 5 minutes / day, free of charge.\n\nOur auto-renewable premium plans feature unlimited song access, across the following term lengths:\n\n• Weekly: $2.99\n• Monthly: $8.99\n• 3 Months: $17.99 \n• 6 Months: $35.99\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEntertain & educate yourself with Univoice.

      "label": "iNaturalist is a social network for sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. The primary goal is to connect people to nature, and the secondary goal is to generate scientifically valuable biodiversity data from these personal encounters. \n\niNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals with visually similar suggestions and verification by dedicated contributors. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you'll create research-quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n• Identification suggestions: Take or import a photo and view the top 10 most visually similar species matches and tap through to get more information. You can view these suggestions even before creating an account.\n• Feedback from our community: Create an account to share your observations and start a conversation about what you saw. Can’t identify the organism? Start with a broad identification like “plants” or “fungi” so others with more expertise can find it and refine the identification. \n• Keep a record of all living things: Build your life list by posting to iNaturalist. Where, when, and what you saw is the basis of each observation you create.\n• Grounded in science: Every identification is connected to the tree of life, which means you can search for broad classifications like “Ferns” or “Fungi” as well as species-level identifications like “Humpback Whale” (and everything in between). \n• Advancing science & conservation: Millions of observations created and identified by the iNaturalist community are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility where they are used to advance scientific understanding of biodiversity through open data and open science. \n• Enabling citizen science and community science: Join any of the tens of thousands of projects around the world on iNaturalist to draw attention to and collect data about particular species or places.\n• Not-for-profit: iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, both 501(c)3 nonprofits in the United States. iNaturalist is free for anyone to use thanks to the generous support of many organizations and individuals. Thank you!\n• No hidden charges: This app is truly free because we believe nature is for everyone.\n• Best for wild plants and animals: The iNaturalist community is better at identifying wild plants and animals than those in gardens or horticulture. Get outside and find what’s wild!\n• Control how your location is shared: Set the privacy to obscured (only general location is shared) or private (no location is shared at all, but much harder for others to help identify). The locations of species at risk from disturbance are automatically obscured.\n• More than a mobile app: iNaturalist has even more extensive features and tools for learning and exploration. Get the full experience at inaturalist.org!\n• 35+ languages: iNaturalist has been translated into dozens of languages thanks to multilingual enthusiasts who want to see the community grow.\n• A global network: iNaturalist is used in every country on earth! In many countries, we have formal agreements with local organizations to promote iNaturalist. Use this app for contributing to all iNaturalist Network sites, including Naturalista (Mexico and Colombia), iNaturalist.NZ (New Zealand), iNaturalist.ca (Canada), Biodiversity4All (Portugal), iNaturalistAU (Australia), iNaturalistPa (Panama), iNaturalistEc (Ecuador), ArgentiNat (Argentina), iNaturalistil (Israel), and iNaturalistFi (Suomi/Finland)."

      "label": "\"OK, so everyone can fold paper in half. What’s so exciting about that?\" you may say. But you’ll soon think differently when you learn more about the art of origami.\nRemember making paper airplanes at school? And remember how someone, instead of an airplane, made a flower, a jumping frog, or a parrot? That was like magic. And they only had their two hands and a plain piece of paper. How did they do it? We’ll show you how.\nThe \"How to Make Origami\" app is simple and easy to use. Follow the step-by-step instructions and watch the 3D animation carefully. And don’t worry, you’d have to try really hard to get confused.\n\n\"Hey, that point shouldn’t be sticking out like that!\" Something went wrong? That’s because even an airplane requires concentration and patience. Let this tranquil pastime completely absorb you, and your complete relaxation is guaranteed. You know, those wise Japanese invented a great thing.  \n\nBy the way, origami develops logical reasoning, attention span, spatial thinking and fine motor skills. Consider that when you’re trying to keep fidgety kids busy.\n\nDownload for free over 80 traditional origami patterns for our app. \n\nThe most famous are\n- Crane\n- Dinosaur\n- Flower\n- Duck\n- Rose\n- Lily\n- Jumping frog\n- Pigeon\n- Rabbit\n\nFold quietly, or your boss may notice!"

      "label": "【使用目标】： 要达到成人水平，1秒/题，零错误率\n【适用人群】： 从未学习过或刚开始学乘法口诀\n【使用要求】： 家长陪伴，帮助判断正确错误\n【使用步骤】：1、选择所需练习的行\n                         2、出现题目后，学生口答，父母进行操作点击熟悉或不熟\n                         3、出现答案后，系统报三遍口诀，**学生跟读红字部分以加深记忆**（3遍口诀+3道算式）\n\n\n【注意事项】：1. 系统设定了5秒限时，时间到会自动出现答案 （等同于点击了”不熟“按钮）\n                         2. 如果不熟练，一行会可能练习较长时间，这是正常现象。\n                         3. 背口诀是在记忆纯数字，尽量不要在一行不熟的情况下，切到另外一行练习，会记混\n                         4. 学生但凡说错就立刻点不熟，不要提示或等他回想到正确答案后再点熟悉。\n                         5. 没有经过”刻意训练”，很多学生可能到高年级甚至初中，都不能达到成人水平。乘法是所有复杂运算的基础，必须要达到非常熟练，形成肌肉记忆。一张试卷上50题，可能包含                                                  着几百次的基础运用。所以如果稍有迟疑那几百次放大后，就会慢许多；如果不能零错误率，那几百次放大后，意味着不小的计算错误。\n【独特优势】：1. 不熟高频出现\n                             九九乘法口诀一共45个，学生有问题的往往是少数几个，所以一定要针对不熟的进行强化训练，而不是随机抽题训练，那样效率会大打折扣，如果有3个不熟，随机训练意味着要接近45次训练才能练到这3个各一遍，效率相差了15倍。\n\n                         2. 不熟加强记忆\n                             当错误后，听到的三遍口诀、看到的突出呈现，以及让学生自主再读的几遍，能更针对性的加强记忆。 \n\n                         3. 确保集中注意\n                             通过限时5秒，以及错误后的复述、增加练习频率，会倒逼学生快速答题，避免拖拉现象。"

Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado.

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain.

It's free to try\n\n\n*** How Does it Work? ***\n\nMovieMethod is a flashcard app. But instead of using images or text we use short movie clips.\n\nThe important part is you're learning the language in full sentences. You'll make much faster progress learning full sentences instead of learning words in isolation.\n\nBut that's not all.\n\nWe also have some cool AI that will constantly recommend the next best sentence for you to learn. What is the next best sentence? It always has just one new frequently used word.\n\nThat's it!\n\nYou just keep learning new words every day. But with each new word you're also learning sentence patterns, grammar, ear training.\n\nAnd darn-it learning from movie clips is just downright fun!\n\n*** FAQ ***\n\nWhat languages do you offer?\n\nWe currently have Spanish for English speakers. English for Spanish speakers. And English for Ukrainian speakers.\n\n\nDoes it work offline?\n\nYes! You can review and learn from your own deck when offline. But to add new cards to your deck you'll need to be online.\n\n\nCan I switch devices and everything will be synced?\n\nYep! When you return to the main screen the app will always sync to our servers. You'll see a green dot when it's synced, yellow when it hasn't synced and red when it hasn't synced for more than 1 day. Make sure you see the green dot before switching devices.\n\nThe app is not designed for frequent switching. It's better to study on just one device so the app can cache clips to your device and everything will load faster.\n\n\n*** Testimonials ***\n\n\"Using InputU is addictive, it has replaced playing games for me.\" - user\n\n\"It feels like I’m downloading the language into my brain! I'm learning 30 new words a day and it's effortless.\" - user\n\n\"Before finding InputU I was using an online language school which cost me about 10x more each month. InputU is cheaper, more fun and more effective. If you come across this little app consider yourself very lucky.\" - user\n\nFind our full terms of use here: https://inputu.com/en/terms"

NEW FORMAT 2020\n\n=> Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. Spaced repetition is commonly applied in contexts in which a learner must acquire a large number of items and retain them indefinitely in memory. It is, therefore, well suited for the problem of vocabulary acquisition in the course of second language learning, due to the size of the target language's inventory of open-class words.

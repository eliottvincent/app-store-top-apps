This also includes the use of instruments to extend the range of our senses. \nUsing apparatus and equipment This is the skill of knowing the functions and limitations of various apparatus, and developing the ability to select and handle them appropriately for various tasks. \n\nIntroduction\nPlay with the Mass Scale Model. Test what you've learned by trying the input field. \nThis Mass Scale Model allows the skills of reading from a circular scale of a typical weighing scale. The three options available allows for student's own testing of the different scales with different decimal places of precision appropriate in each scale's smallest division.\n\nCommon misconceptions\nStudents typically can tell masses of whole numbers such as 600 g, but to be able to type in 0.60 kg requires some understanding of decimal places.\n\nNew Feature Added\nNow, grams option is added for ease of whole number learning\n\n\nSample Learning Goals\n(g) describe how to measure a variety of masses with appropriate accuracy by means of weighing scales.\n\nInteresting Fact\nThis simulation has touch-sensitive controls for the pointer and the actual reading (yes, I need to program for these features) which other apps may not have.\n\nAcknowledgment\nMy sincere gratitude for the tireless contributions of Francisco Esquembre, Fu-Kwun Hwang, Wolfgang Christian, Félix Jesús Garcia Clemente, Anne Cox, Andrew Duffy, Todd Timberlake and many more in the Open Source Physics community."

      "label": "THE CUBE\nRubik’s cube was invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. Originally called the 'Magic Cube'.\n\nTHE METHOD\nReally easy to learn method for solving the Rubik’s cube taught in a fun and easy way even for a baby.\nThis method consists in 7 easy movements: White Cross, Middle Layer, Yellow Cross Position, Yellow Cross Orientation, Position Corners and Final Movement.\n\nThe method’s great advantage is its simplicity. As an example the Final Movement only needs 4 rotations and not the usual 10 or 12 that no one can remember.\n\nThe cube has 6 faces with 6 colors and 26 pieces:\nCenter: Pieces with 1 color located in each face’s center. It tells us the cube’s face’s color.\nCorner: Pieces with 3 colors located in the cube’s corners. There are 8 in total.\nBorder: Pieces with 2 colors located between cube corners. There are 12 in total.\n\nThe movement’s sequences are explained step by step. In each step you can see which face you have to rotate and a title. Try to remember these titles and the rotation comes alone.\n\nYour suggestions are more than welcome at info@fithx.com.\nSubject: Solve The Cube\nPlease tell us the case and the page number in the message."

      "label": "Sky Live is a great app for planning the star observations and for making gorgeous photos of the starry night sky. Lots of astronomers and night sky photographers worldwide have chosen the app to help them in planning their nights out for watching stars, planets and constellations.\n\nAll necessary info is available at once: what planets, bright stars and constellations will be above the horizon at night, what the weather is like, what the visibility score is, and much more. After setting the location you can check the stargazing index for the whole week ahead and learn the best time for the night out. \n\nThe unique index for stargazing conditions is calculated hourly and renews each time you start the app. The index depends on the following criteria:\n\n- Weather forecast\n- Light Pollution\n- Visible objects\n- The Moonlight​\n\nThe Sky Live app works in pair with Star Walk 2 that means you can see the chosen object in the sky and check more info about its’ path through the night sky. Sky Live also has an Apple Watch extension to alert you of upcoming astronomical events and tell you what’s going on in the sky over your location at the moment, e.g. ISS flyby or bright Iridium flare.\n\n\"For stargazers, Sky Live is exactly the app we've always needed to find out just how much of the stars we can see at night and when we'll be able to see our favourite constellations and planets.\" by Nathan Snelgrove, AppStorm.net.\n\nStunning space photos combined with everything you need to know about stargazing conditions for your location tonight. Stargazer or not - this app will spark your curiosity. \n\nThe most accurate hourly conditions for stargazing are estimated on seven criteria and summarized in one Stargazing Index that will give you all the information you need to make your plans. The formula was developed by a mathematician on the Star Walk team and takes into account: \n\n- Is there anything interesting in the sky tonight? \n- Can I see Saturn? \n- Is it going to be cloudy? \n- Is it going to rain? \n- Too much light? \n- Is the Moon too bright for stargazing? \n\nYou will also get detailed reports on position and trajectory of the International Space Station, the Sun, the Moon, Jupiter and other planets. The forecast is available for seven days ahead."

      "label": "Welcome to \"Lila's World\" \n\nPlay as Lila while she visits her Grandma's house for the summer. There are a lot of things to discover all throughout this mystery manor in which Grandma lives. Explore the house, read a book in the library or have a tea party in the living room. Play the piano in the Music room or Cook almost any dish you can think of in the Kitchen. While you explore, don’t forget to look for the many secrets of the house. Now what could Grandma be hiding?\n\nNot only can you play in Grandma's house but you can draw and create your own worlds too. Use real paper and colors to draw new characters, scenes, food, objects and a lot more. \n\nBrowse all the different worlds created by all the imaginative kids out there. The possibilities are endless. \n\nMaybe you can help Lila setup her cousin Ro's birthday party, or go to the park for a picnic with her friends. \n\nMaybe you can sail the oceans on a pirate ship, or just have fun day at the beach with your family.\n\nYou can also play with your own drawn characters in the real world in the AR mode. Just watch as your own drawings come to life. It’s like Magic!\n\nMake your own pretend play world!\n\nPLAY:\nIn “Lila’s Word” there are no rules and no goals. Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

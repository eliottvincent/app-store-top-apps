Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "Learning a language can be an experience that transforms your life. Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n• 2019 PCMag Editors’ Choice\n• 2019 Tabby Awards Winner\n• 2019 Best Mobile App Awards: Best Designed App and Best Overall App\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next.

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

      "label": "Welcome to \"Lila's World\" \n\nPlay as Lila while she visits her Grandma's house for the summer. There are a lot of things to discover all throughout this mystery manor in which Grandma lives. Explore the house, read a book in the library or have a tea party in the living room. Play the piano in the Music room or Cook almost any dish you can think of in the Kitchen. While you explore, don’t forget to look for the many secrets of the house. Now what could Grandma be hiding?\n\nNot only can you play in Grandma's house but you can draw and create your own worlds too. Use real paper and colors to draw new characters, scenes, food, objects and a lot more. \n\nBrowse all the different worlds created by all the imaginative kids out there. The possibilities are endless. \n\nMaybe you can help Lila setup her cousin Ro's birthday party, or go to the park for a picnic with her friends. \n\nMaybe you can sail the oceans on a pirate ship, or just have fun day at the beach with your family.\n\nYou can also play with your own drawn characters in the real world in the AR mode. Just watch as your own drawings come to life. It’s like Magic!\n\nMake your own pretend play world!\n\nPLAY:\nIn “Lila’s Word” there are no rules and no goals. Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado.

      "label": "SPEECH THERAPY APP\n¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\nThis speech app is designed to transform “Speech therapy into an interesting game”. Each speech therapy exercise has a special game card with fascinating animation that ensures a child’s interaction with an app.\nTake for instance, “Eating pizza” game card for language therapy. When a child starts repeating the speech therapy exercise (opening the mouth – eating a slice of pizza), the speech app recognizes this movement and accelerates animation.\n\nThe first 2 game levels are free, while subsequent levels are available with a subscription: weekly, monthly, permanent.\nFirst game cards are available for free in each of the 11 categories. The app is free for the first three days of the trial period.\n\nCOLLECTION OF EXERCISE IN THE SPEECH THERAPY APPLICATION:\n\n¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\n•  Exercises “First Sounds”. This is a collection of exercises that helps children begin to make the first sounds. These are sounds of the outside world, sounds of animals or sounds of transport. Also, these exercises allow you to develop the pronunciation of sounds s, r, l, t and many others with which the child has difficulty in pronunciation.\n\n•  Exercises \"Speech exercise\". These exercises are designed to develop articulation in children. The constant practice of speech therapy will allow you to quickly begin to pronounce sounds and words.\n\n\nChildren are reluctant to perform speech therapy because they are too bored. Faced with this problem, many children have difficulty developing speech and even disorders such as Apraxia and Dyslexia. We decided to use mobile apps as a fun tool for interactive children's speech learning. The application also prevents the development of problems such as Apraxia and Dyslexia.\n\nThe Miogym speech application also helps children with autism and promotes child development. The Autism application is one of the areas we are developing. Autism is hard, but we try to make it easier for children to learn.\n\nAfter consulting with a speech therapist, together we made the best plan of speech exercises and training sets for children.\n\nThe exercise plan was implemented in the Miogym application in the speech therapy game format. Through interactive exercises, the child receives rewards and opens new levels.\nAll kids love smartphones - that's a fact, so we want kids to spend time in front of the phone with the benefit of themselves, learning to speak. Parents also reduce the difficulty of achieving good pronunciation in their children. And any speech therapist can give interesting tasks as homework in the format of the game with the help of a speech therapy app. This approach will save the speech therapist's time and that of the parents.\n\nThe speech therapy application is for toddlers and children 2,3,4,5,6,7 years old.\n\nNow Miogym is actively used by speech therapists and parents around the world to teach children. Download the app and enjoy your kid's development.\n\n\nInformation about the auto-renewable nature of the subscription:\n•  Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase or when trial period is over\n•  Free trial subscription is automatically renewed unless cancelled 24 hours before the renewal\n•  Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication\n•  Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n•  Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n\nMore information: http://miogym.com\nPrivacy policy: http://miogym.com/privacypolicy\nTerms of use: http://miogym.com/termsofuse"

Visit the Chrome Store and search for “Mirinae”.\n\n◉ Built-in Dictionary, Searchable Grammar & Idiom Reference and Grammar-term Glossary\nMirinae has a built-in dictionary & searchable grammar reference and can also be used as a deep, interactive Korean reference that is driven by examples of the things you want to search for.    The library has a large and growing number of idiom patterns and neologisms (newly-coined words), essential for understanding modern spoken Korean, Kpop lyrics and Kdrama dialog.\n\n◉ High tech!!\nMirinae uses advanced machine learning, natural language processing and a non-deterministic phrase-structure parser, coupled with a proprietary regular-expression grammar-pattern, idiom and neologism library to build a lexical and grammatical analysis of the text, showing a breakdown of the text into its component words and particles and suffixes and other parts-of-speech along with a display of its structure in terms of phrases and predicates and clauses.\n\nIt also uses an advanced, bi-language embedding-vector meaning disambiguator to provide likely meanings for individual words in the sentence, which is not easily determined from a full sentence-translation, as you might get from a standard translation site.\n\n◉ User quotes:\n• “WHERE HAS THIS BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE\nAs someone who prefers to Korean deconstruct a sentence in order to learn how to put it together this is PERFECT!”\n\n• “I’ve been searching for something like this for a while now so this is amazing. Korean grammar is my weakest subject so this is beyond helpful. Thank you so, so much!”\n\n◉ FAQ\n•How to use Mirinae?\nVisit https://mirinae.io/#/support \n\n◉ NOTE\n• If you have any questions or suggestions please contact us:\n  - helpdesk: team@mirinae.io\n  - website: https://mirinae.io\n  - privacy policy: https://company.mirinae.io/privacy-policy/\n  - terms of use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n  - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mirinae.io/\n  - twitter: https://twitter.com/mirinae_io\n  - youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/mirinae_io"

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nIf you need help, have questions, or just want to say, “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games.\n\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\n\nhttp://binibambini.com/privacy\n\nMore about Bini Games:\n\nBini Games is a group of enthusiastic professionals including designers, artists, animators, programmers, and musicians, who love to create digital games for children.\n\nAll our games are safe and do not collect any personal information."

Por eso cada párrafo de Memodi contiene preguntas y ejercicios para que no olvides nada.\n2) Textos multimodales: el formato con colores, negritas, subrayados, y demás, permite \"romper\" el texto como si fuera un objeto para comprenderlo mejor. Y por supuesto, lo vuelve todo menos aburrido. Cada punto clave de Memodi es llamativo.\n3) Diversificación: estudios demuestran que es mejor leer temas \"salteados\" entre sí, porque eso permite crear conexiones y consolidar más el conocimiento.\n4) Repetición espaciada: Cuando lees algo, ¿cuánto recuerdas en 1 semana? ¿Y en 3 semanas? Aunque la memoria humana es increíble, estamos hechos para olvidar. Es ahí donde entra la Repetición Espaciada. Gracias al algoritmo, la aplicación va a agendar los repasos que tengas que hacer de los puntos clave, separándolos entre sí lo suficiente para que jamás los olvides. Así podrás recordar desde cosas tan esenciales como el tratamiento de la enterocolitis necrosante y la escala de Bell, hasta el cromosoma y gen que se muta en Fibrosis quística.\nLo único que tienes que hacer es dedicarle unos minutos durante el día, cuando sea que puedas y te sientas listo. Ideal para estudiar durante una guardia o mientras esperas tu café. Sin el problema de buscar información, de leer cosas que no sirven y por supuesto, de olvidar.\n\nMemodi está diseñada por un médico, pensando en la vida de otro médico. Guardias, cantidad exorbitante de información y temas, literatura únicamente escrita en inglés o de fuente dudosa, falta de tiempo o de energía para estudiar; todo eso se acabó.\nMemodi está diseñada para: estudiantes de medicina del último año, Médicos Internos (MIP), Médicos Pasantes del Servicio Social, Médicos Generales que quieran presentar el ENARM o que simplemente quieran tener la información siempre fresca y mantenerse actualizados, Médicos Especialistas que deseen no olvidar la Medicina de otras áreas.\n\nMemodi contiene:\nA) +2,500 puntos clave de +900 temas de toda la Medicina, y todas las especialidades: Dermatología, Endocrinología, Reumatología, Neumología, Cardiología, Infectología, Cirugía, Neurocirugía, Cirugía Vascular, Medicina Interna, Traumatología, Anestesiología, Gastroenterología, Pediatría, Ginecología, y más (para una lista completa visita: https://memodiapp.com/lista-de-temas). Los temas se encuentran divididos en 3 partes: 1) Definición, epidemiología, causas y patogenia, 2) Clínica y diagnóstico, 3) Tratamiento, prevención/screening, complicaciones.\nB) Los puntos clave están basados en los mejores Journals, Guías Internacionales y literatura reciente, pero traducidos al español y escritos de una manera fácil de leer; no tardarás más de 1 minuto por tarjeta. Además, todos tienen formato para que sea aún más fácil recordar y leer.\nC) Gracias a que la base de datos está en la nube, la información es actualizable con los últimos estudios y descubrimientos que cambian la práctica médica.\nD) Tiene una interfaz sencilla de usar; de hecho lo único que tienes que hacer es leer y presionar un botón para ver la siguiente tarjeta de información.\n\nFuncionamiento. Es fácil, inicia hoy mismo:\n1) Baja la aplicación y regístrate para sincronizar tu progreso en la nube.\n2) Selecciona cuántas tarjetas/puntos clave nuevos por día quieres ver. Te recomendamos 6-10.\n3) Dedícale unos minutos al día, y deja que el algoritmo haga el resto, mientras tú te dedicas a estudiar Medicina de la manera más inteligente con Memodi.\nTérminos de uso: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Aunque la presentación es académica, también se basa en la iluminación del Espíritu Santo.\n\nEste canal ofrece al espectador de habla hispana la oportunidad de escuchar una muestra de lo que los estudiantes de nuestro Instituto escuchan cada día en hebreo.\n\nEl Dr. Baruch es escuchado en todo Israel cada semana en el programa de televisión israelí P'dut L'amo. También se transmite una versión en inglés de este programa en todo Estados Unidos y otros países de habla inglesa."

      "label": "Learn American English with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the American English language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core American English words, form sentences, learn to speak American English phrases and take part in conversations.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own American English language tutor in your pocket.\nDownload the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the American English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of American English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right American English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your American English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak American English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning American English. Mondly teaches you American English vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational American English. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the American English verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• Advanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family.\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these English lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com"

      "label": "\"OK, so everyone can fold paper in half. What’s so exciting about that?\" you may say. But you’ll soon think differently when you learn more about the art of origami.\nRemember making paper airplanes at school? And remember how someone, instead of an airplane, made a flower, a jumping frog, or a parrot? That was like magic. And they only had their two hands and a plain piece of paper. How did they do it? We’ll show you how.\nThe \"How to Make Origami\" app is simple and easy to use. Follow the step-by-step instructions and watch the 3D animation carefully. And don’t worry, you’d have to try really hard to get confused.\n\n\"Hey, that point shouldn’t be sticking out like that!\" Something went wrong? That’s because even an airplane requires concentration and patience. Let this tranquil pastime completely absorb you, and your complete relaxation is guaranteed. You know, those wise Japanese invented a great thing.  \n\nBy the way, origami develops logical reasoning, attention span, spatial thinking and fine motor skills. Consider that when you’re trying to keep fidgety kids busy.\n\nDownload for free over 80 traditional origami patterns for our app. \n\nThe most famous are\n- Crane\n- Dinosaur\n- Flower\n- Duck\n- Rose\n- Lily\n- Jumping frog\n- Pigeon\n- Rabbit\n\nFold quietly, or your boss may notice!"

Then start building a daily review habit using the app and daily email. By reviewing your highlights every day, you'll retain dramatically more and you'll finally stop forgetting all the details from books you just finished!\n\n---\n\n“Readwise is my favorite new service this year. Save highlights from Kindle, Instapaper, and now tweets... one of the best long-term personal learning tools I’ve come across.” — Caleb Hicks\n\n“Besides my Kindle, Readwise has been the most influential tech for improving my reading process.” — Blake Reichmann\n\n“If you use Kindle or Instapaper or just enjoy keeping and reading highlights, please sign up to Readwise. It will become one of your cherished services.” — Christopher Galtenberg\n\n---\n\nACTUALLY USE YOUR HIGHLIGHTS\nHighlighting is great, but why bother if you're never going to see any of your highlights again? Readwise makes it easy to quickly liberate all your highlights into one place, ensuring that you'll actually see and use them, including highlights from:\n\n• Amazon Kindle\n• Apple iBooks\n• Instapaper\n• Pocket\n• Medium\n• Goodreads\n• Twitter\n• Physical Books (using OCR)\n• Manual Input\n• CSV Upload\n\n\nSTOP FORGETTING WHAT YOU READ\nHow often do you finish a book, only to forget the key ideas two weeks later? We don't remember things by just reading them once.\n\nReadwise solves this problem using scientifically proven learning techniques called Spaced Repetition and Active Recall. Readwise resurfaces the right highlights at the right times using a daily email and an app. Readwise even makes it possible to convert your best highlights into flashcards for added retention.\n\n\nTAG, NOTE, SEARCH, AND ORGANIZE\nWith your highlights all in one place, Readwise enables you to organize and connect these ideas in new ways. Use search to find a highlight instantly; use tag to organize highlights within your library; use notes to add your own annotations.\n\n\nHIGHLIGHT PAPER BOOKS\nReadwise also makes it possible to take highlights from your physical books and papers using your phone’s camera. Just snap a pic, highlight with your finger, and have your favorite highlights saved forever.\n\n---\n\nIf you are not already a Readwise subscriber, you can get started immediately with a 30-day free trial with no credit card upfront. At the end of the trial, you will not be charged unless you choose to subscribe to Readwise Full or Readwise Lite. Price may vary by location. Manage your subscription from your dashboard.\n\n---\n\nSupport:  Check out readwise.io/faq or email us at hello@readwise.io\nPrivacy Policy: https://readwise.io/tos\nTerms of Service: https://readwise.io/privacy"

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "This application is dedicated to one of the most complicated topic in the English language — Phrasal Verbs. There are dozens of rules and nuances in this topic, but we have made maybe the easiest way to deal with it.\n\nWhen we face a phrasal verb for the first time, they usually do not know HOW to translate it and then HOW to use it. The problem occurs rather often because there are more than 10000+ phrasal verbs in English. That means, that we meet them every day in the spoken and written language.\n\nBut at the same time, such a big number does not mean that all of these phrasal verbs are of common usage. The majority of them just rest inside the vocabulary. Native speakers know them but they hardly use them in every day speech. \n\nThat is why we have collected phrasal verbs of wide usage. They will help you extend your vocabulary and understand native speakers.\n\nBeing the developer, we take much care about our users. We understand clearly that it is not appropriate to give just a list of verbs like all other vocabularies do. It is not comfortable for learning, understanding and practice.\n\nWe really believe that learning apps should develop students’ skills in a clear and simple way. That is why you will find a very friendly interface and useful functions inside the app.\n\nWe have included 200 phrasal verbs. You can read and learn them in two ways:\n— use an alphabetical list and open a card with the verb you do not know;\n— fun game and practice to remember phrasal verb\n— quiz with more than 10 level to improve phrasal verbs.\n\nEvery card contains a simple explanation and an example of usage. Also every verb is marked separable/inseparable. Students can use bookmarks to form the list of necessary phrasal verbs. \n\nAfter you have studied the verbs you are able to check your knowledge. We have made up a collection of quiz where users are offered to choose the needed phrasal verb or to choose the needed meaning. When you complete a test the app shows you the result and mistakes.\n\nDownload and enjoy. It 's free."

      "label": "Application Saint-faustina.org (Faustyna.pl) covers key topics connected with St. Faustina, devotion to the Divine Mercy in the forms handed on to her by Jesus, daily thoughts from her “Diary,” and information about the capital of devotion to Divine Mercy:  Shrine in Cracow-Łagiewniki.  Moreover, it also provides current news (text and photo), access to live streaming from the Chapel of the Miraculous Image of Merciful Jesus as well as quick information about ongoing works at the Łagiewniki Shrine.\n\nThrough this app, the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, together with many co-workers, shares the gift of the message of Divine Mercy that Jesus gives to the whole world through St. Faustina. St. John Paul II calling St. Faustina’s spiritual wealth and the message of mercy “God’s gift for our times,” passes on this gift to the Church and the world of the Third Millennium. Through this gift, Jesus reminds us about the biblical truth about the merciful love of God for every man and invites us all to proclaim it with new vigor by the witness of life, deeds, words and prayer. The new forms of devotion to Divine Mercy that Jesus gave form part of this message. These are: the Image of Christ with the signature: Jesus, I trust in You, Divine Mercy Sunday which falls on the first Sunday after Easter, Chaplet of Divine Mercy, Hour of Mercy (3:00 PM) and Spreading devotion to Divine Mercy. Great promises are attached to each one of them provided that they are practiced in the spirit of trust in God (fulfillment of His will) and mercy toward neighbor.\n\nWith the death of St. Faustina, God as it were laid down this gift of the message of Mercy at the Shrine in Cracow-Łagiewniki. This is why St. John Paul II called this place the capital of devotion to Divine Mercy. From this place, the message goes out to the entire world carried by modern apostles of Divine Mercy, today reaching many millions. These modern apostles make up the Apostolic Movement of Divine Mercy (this is that new congregation, which Jesus wanted established): various congregations, cloistered and active, male and female, associations, confraternities, apostolates and people who individually undertake St. Faustina’s mission of proclaiming and imploring God’s mercy for the world. This spark needs to be lighted by the grace of God, said John Paul II at the Łagiewniki Shrine, This fire of mercy needs to be passed on to the world. In the mercy of God the world will find peace and mankind will find happiness!"

This also includes the use of instruments to extend the range of our senses. \nUsing apparatus and equipment This is the skill of knowing the functions and limitations of various apparatus, and developing the ability to select and handle them appropriately for various tasks. \n\nIntroduction\nPlay with the Mass Scale Model. Test what you've learned by trying the input field. \nThis Mass Scale Model allows the skills of reading from a circular scale of a typical weighing scale. The three options available allows for student's own testing of the different scales with different decimal places of precision appropriate in each scale's smallest division.\n\nCommon misconceptions\nStudents typically can tell masses of whole numbers such as 600 g, but to be able to type in 0.60 kg requires some understanding of decimal places.\n\nNew Feature Added\nNow, grams option is added for ease of whole number learning\n\n\nSample Learning Goals\n(g) describe how to measure a variety of masses with appropriate accuracy by means of weighing scales.\n\nInteresting Fact\nThis simulation has touch-sensitive controls for the pointer and the actual reading (yes, I need to program for these features) which other apps may not have.\n\nAcknowledgment\nMy sincere gratitude for the tireless contributions of Francisco Esquembre, Fu-Kwun Hwang, Wolfgang Christian, Félix Jesús Garcia Clemente, Anne Cox, Andrew Duffy, Todd Timberlake and many more in the Open Source Physics community."

You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York. Lively, colorful, and sometimes surprising characters: an eccentric old lady will help you find a place to live, and a greedy hot-dog vendor who will try to short-change… They (and many more) speak different accents and will help you master street talk. There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go. Each conversation takes no more than 3 minutes and will fit into even the busiest of schedules.\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY\n\nYou’ll learn 6,000 of the most common words everyone needs to travel, work, and communicate in a foreign language. Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations. Built-in games will challenge your skill and speed – you can even compete with other users around the world in real-time!"

      "label": "Welcome to \"Lila's World\" \n\nPlay as Lila while she visits her Grandma's house for the summer. There are a lot of things to discover all throughout this mystery manor in which Grandma lives. Explore the house, read a book in the library or have a tea party in the living room. Play the piano in the Music room or Cook almost any dish you can think of in the Kitchen. While you explore, don’t forget to look for the many secrets of the house. Now what could Grandma be hiding?\n\nNot only can you play in Grandma's house but you can draw and create your own worlds too. Use real paper and colors to draw new characters, scenes, food, objects and a lot more. \n\nBrowse all the different worlds created by all the imaginative kids out there. The possibilities are endless. \n\nMaybe you can help Lila setup her cousin Ro's birthday party, or go to the park for a picnic with her friends. \n\nMaybe you can sail the oceans on a pirate ship, or just have fun day at the beach with your family.\n\nYou can also play with your own drawn characters in the real world in the AR mode. Just watch as your own drawings come to life. It’s like Magic!\n\nMake your own pretend play world!\n\nPLAY:\nIn “Lila’s Word” there are no rules and no goals. Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

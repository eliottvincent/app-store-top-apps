Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words.

Graded entirely on your pronunciation, our app makes language learning fresh and fun.\n\nLearn to speak Spanish, French, German and English like a native speaker. Unlike traditional language learning apps, that teach you ‘classroom’ speak, Univoice teaches you to speak a new language as it’s spoken in the real world, including idioms and slang words.\n\nJust load up the app, select the language and genre of music that suits your mood and start singing along with the artist. As you sing or speak, you can see the translation of the lyrics back into your native language.\n\nWe’ll grade you on your pronunciation, not your pitch or tone, so you can see how well you’ve done and how you improve over time!\n\nLong gone are the days of memorizing long vocabulary lists, repeating the same keywords and phrases, or reading pages of grammar rules. Now you can learn through song – scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn how to speak a new language!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nHow does the Univoice app work?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**No singing skill required! We grade only on pronunciation**\n• Pick from Spanish, French, German, and English\n• Choose from a wide range of 30+ music genres\n• Sing (or speak) with the artist in the language you’re learning\n• Follow the translation into your native language as you speak\n• Familiarize yourself with idioms & slang words you won’t find in a textbook\n• Expand your vocabulary & learn new phrases the fun way... through music!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat motivates Univoicers to learn a new language?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n• Becoming a global citizen & raising globally-minded children\n• Connecting with others in a more meaningful, organic way\n• Staying tightly connected to heritage & strengthening family ties\n• Communicating more fluidly with coworkers, clients, patients\n• Learning to speak (and sing) a dream language like a native\n• Immersing oneself in the culture, while learning the language\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat subscription plans does Univoice offer?\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAll app users will receive 5 minutes / day, free of charge.\n\nOur auto-renewable premium plans feature unlimited song access, across the following term lengths:\n\n• Weekly: $2.99\n• Monthly: $8.99\n• 3 Months: $17.99 \n• 6 Months: $35.99\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEntertain & educate yourself with Univoice.

      "label": "◉ Let Mirinae be your AI Korean Teacher!\nYou enter a Korean sentence and Mirinae will translate the sentence, show you all the individual parts of speech, find and explain any grammar patterns present, explain the particles and honorifics and verb conjugations, identify & explain any idioms or neologisms used, and draw out a parse-tree showing all the individual phrases & clauses in the sentence.\n\nClick on anything in the explanation for more details, alternate word definitions, example uses, related patterns, cross-references to learning sites and major textbooks, and much more..\n\nAll this allows the learner to explore Korean wherever they encounter it, perhaps an example sentence in a dictionary or lesson text, some song lyrics or drama dialog, etc., and interactively discover its meaning, syntax, grammar patterns and any idioms used, and then to explore and continue learning, finding other examples of the patterns and words used.\n\n◉ Learn while watching Kdrama or browsing the web\nThere is also a Chrome Extension version that lets you explore and learn from Korean text you encounter on any website, including Kdrama subtitles on streaming sites like Viki.com, Netflix and Youtube.\n\nWhen enabled, the Mirinae extension will detect Korean on any web-page, so you can explore and get a deep understanding of any Korean directly within the page so that it can be very easily used to augment existing Korean teaching, reference and translation sites and video streaming sites. Visit the Chrome Store and search for “Mirinae”.\n\n◉ Built-in Dictionary, Searchable Grammar & Idiom Reference and Grammar-term Glossary\nMirinae has a built-in dictionary & searchable grammar reference and can also be used as a deep, interactive Korean reference that is driven by examples of the things you want to search for.    The library has a large and growing number of idiom patterns and neologisms (newly-coined words), essential for understanding modern spoken Korean, Kpop lyrics and Kdrama dialog.\n\n◉ High tech!!\nMirinae uses advanced machine learning, natural language processing and a non-deterministic phrase-structure parser, coupled with a proprietary regular-expression grammar-pattern, idiom and neologism library to build a lexical and grammatical analysis of the text, showing a breakdown of the text into its component words and particles and suffixes and other parts-of-speech along with a display of its structure in terms of phrases and predicates and clauses.\n\nIt also uses an advanced, bi-language embedding-vector meaning disambiguator to provide likely meanings for individual words in the sentence, which is not easily determined from a full sentence-translation, as you might get from a standard translation site.\n\n◉ User quotes:\n• “WHERE HAS THIS BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE\nAs someone who prefers to Korean deconstruct a sentence in order to learn how to put it together this is PERFECT!”\n\n• “I’ve been searching for something like this for a while now so this is amazing. Korean grammar is my weakest subject so this is beyond helpful. Thank you so, so much!”\n\n◉ FAQ\n•How to use Mirinae?\nVisit https://mirinae.io/#/support \n\n◉ NOTE\n• If you have any questions or suggestions please contact us:\n  - helpdesk: team@mirinae.io\n  - website: https://mirinae.io\n  - privacy policy: https://company.mirinae.io/privacy-policy/\n  - terms of use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n  - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mirinae.io/\n  - twitter: https://twitter.com/mirinae_io\n  - youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/mirinae_io"

      "label": "Ever wonder why so many astronomy apps are so hard to use? We do. So we made Classic Sky Map simple and intuitive enough for anyone to enjoy. The user interface is beautiful and straightforward, the controls are easy to use and most settings are just a tap or two away. Classic Sky Map shows you thousands of the brightest stars, the Moon, planets, constellations, meteor showers and more. And it's painless. \n\n\nFree Features:\n\n- Live Tracking. Simply point your device toward the stars and the sky map aligns itself automatically, showing you the portion of the sky at which you are looking. If your device has a compass, Classic Sky Map uses it automatically. If not, you can tell Classic Sky Map where the North is, and it aligns the sky map accordingly.\n\n- Live Earth Map. Quickly jump from one city to another by tapping on a map that shows the Earth's day and night boundary in real-time. If you allow it, Classic Sky Map can detect your current location automatically. You can also create custom viewing locations in seconds.\n\n- Fast Forward and Rewind. Accelerate or reverse time to understand how stars and planets appear to move in the sky over a longer period of time.\n\n- Beautiful Constellation Images. We put a tremendous amount of work into creating beautiful constellation images inspired by antique engravings and aligning them precisely with the stars.\n\n- Sharing. Share snapshots of the sky map with your friends at the tap of a button.\n\n- Quick Help. Should you have any questions while using Classic Sky Map, a concise, illustrated user guide will help answer them quickly.\n\n\nFull Version Features (In-App Purchase):\n\n- Interactive Search. Simply type in a search field, pick an object from a list of matches, then point your device toward the sky. An arrow appears and guides you until you are pointing your device toward the object you selected. If the object is not yet visible in the sky, its next rise time is displayed.\n\n- Sky Events. Classic Sky Map shows a list of current sky events such as meteor showers, eclipses and more and helps you quickly locate them in the sky.\n\n- Night Vision. Classic Sky Map's night vision mode helps minimize loss of dark adaptation. And we went the extra mile to make it look great in cyan, orange or red.\n\n- Extra Information. Tooltips and an information panel show details about stars, planets, the Moon, meteor showers and more.\n\n- Personalization Options. Personalize your sky map by turning various guides and display options on or off.\n\n\nHave fun!"

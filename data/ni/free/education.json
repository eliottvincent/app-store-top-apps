      "label": "Welcome to \"Lila's World\" \n\nPlay as Lila while she visits her Grandma's house for the summer. There are a lot of things to discover all throughout this mystery manor in which Grandma lives. Explore the house, read a book in the library or have a tea party in the living room. Play the piano in the Music room or Cook almost any dish you can think of in the Kitchen. While you explore, don’t forget to look for the many secrets of the house. Now what could Grandma be hiding?\n\nNot only can you play in Grandma's house but you can draw and create your own worlds too. Use real paper and colors to draw new characters, scenes, food, objects and a lot more. \n\nBrowse all the different worlds created by all the imaginative kids out there. The possibilities are endless. \n\nMaybe you can help Lila setup her cousin Ro's birthday party, or go to the park for a picnic with her friends. \n\nMaybe you can sail the oceans on a pirate ship, or just have fun day at the beach with your family.\n\nYou can also play with your own drawn characters in the real world in the AR mode. Just watch as your own drawings come to life. It’s like Magic!\n\nMake your own pretend play world!\n\nPLAY:\nIn “Lila’s Word” there are no rules and no goals. Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

There are some new animal characters to guide and motivate kids through exercises to achieve learning goals and make learning fun!\nChoose from 28 fun sections: Early Sounds, When I Grow Up, Get into Shapes, Living Colors, Yummy Time, This Is My Body, Mouth Gym, Animal Kingdom, Ride Your Wheels, Sing-Along, and many more!\n\nSCIENTIFICALLY-PROVEN LEARNING TECHNIQUES\nSpeech Blubs uses video modeling for immersive learning, where children observe their peers as “teachers'' on video. When children watch their peers in real-time, their MIRROR NEURONS fire up! This scientifically proven and effective approach was confirmed in a UCLA study published by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and showed that kids learn faster and better when learning from other kids.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION, PRICING, & TERMS\nSpeech Blubs starts with a 7-day free trial.

The user interface is beautiful and straightforward, the controls are easy to use and most settings are just a tap or two away. Classic Sky Map shows you thousands of the brightest stars, the Moon, planets, constellations, meteor showers and more. And it's painless. \n\n\nFree Features:\n\n- Live Tracking. Simply point your device toward the stars and the sky map aligns itself automatically, showing you the portion of the sky at which you are looking. If your device has a compass, Classic Sky Map uses it automatically. If not, you can tell Classic Sky Map where the North is, and it aligns the sky map accordingly.\n\n- Live Earth Map. Quickly jump from one city to another by tapping on a map that shows the Earth's day and night boundary in real-time. If you allow it, Classic Sky Map can detect your current location automatically. You can also create custom viewing locations in seconds.\n\n- Fast Forward and Rewind. Accelerate or reverse time to understand how stars and planets appear to move in the sky over a longer period of time.\n\n- Beautiful Constellation Images. We put a tremendous amount of work into creating beautiful constellation images inspired by antique engravings and aligning them precisely with the stars.\n\n- Sharing. Share snapshots of the sky map with your friends at the tap of a button.\n\n- Quick Help. Should you have any questions while using Classic Sky Map, a concise, illustrated user guide will help answer them quickly.\n\n\nFull Version Features (In-App Purchase):\n\n- Interactive Search. Simply type in a search field, pick an object from a list of matches, then point your device toward the sky. An arrow appears and guides you until you are pointing your device toward the object you selected. If the object is not yet visible in the sky, its next rise time is displayed.\n\n- Sky Events. Classic Sky Map shows a list of current sky events such as meteor showers, eclipses and more and helps you quickly locate them in the sky.\n\n- Night Vision. Classic Sky Map's night vision mode helps minimize loss of dark adaptation. And we went the extra mile to make it look great in cyan, orange or red.\n\n- Extra Information. Tooltips and an information panel show details about stars, planets, the Moon, meteor showers and more.\n\n- Personalization Options. Personalize your sky map by turning various guides and display options on or off.\n\n\nHave fun!"

Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

Other dictionaries just leave you guessing!\n\n• We've got Optical Character Recognition (OCR) too. Spotted some Chinese you can't read? Capture a photo of some Chinese text from a menu, book or sign, and the app identifies and translates the characters for you.  \n\n• Search for words by part of speech - simply type the abbreviated type followed by a period (.). For example, \"ma n.\" gets you \"ma\" words that are nouns.\n\n• Mistyped a word? Helpful spelling suggestions get you to the right results fast.\n\n• Words feature both example sentences and measure words for nouns. It's time to move beyond \"个\"! And best of all it's all connected: tap examples and measure words to open them as full dictionary entries.\n\n• trainchinese is great for students: it includes more than a thousand vocabulary lists covering topics from International Relations to American Football Teams and more. Feel like something's missing? Users often get in touch to ask for lists on the topics they're studying, and we're happy to oblige! You'll also find lists containing HSK-level words (both old and new standards), plus TOCFL lists for students in Taiwan!\n\n• Highlight words with your finger for super-fast access to character animations, related searches and more!\n\n• Whether you're studying the Simplified (mainland China and Singapore) or Traditional (Hong Kong and Taiwan) variants, we've got you covered! Easily switch between them or choose to display both in dictionary results and on flash cards. Even better, you can use the phonetics you're comfortable with - choose from Pinyin with tone marks, Pinyin with tone numbers or even Zhuyin characters (from the BoPoMoFo system used in Taiwan).\n\n• Create flash cards with audio and animation from dictionary entries. Organise them into lists, and share them with friends (or students).\n\n• Our Spaced Repetition system ensures you'll memorize words for good.\n\n• Train your way: each card is available in four different modes to test different aspects of Chinese study. See Chinese, Pinyin or English and get tested on translation, and even compare your handwriting to a stroke-order animation side-by-side, synchronized! Or if you prefer, there's multiple choice training too (for a real challenge, try it in \"Dictation\" mode!).\n\n• Flash cards are saved on your device and synchronized with trainchinese.com, where you can also train with them and find more great content.\n\n• Add study notes to your flash cards - they're saved and backed up at trainchinese.com.\n\nDon't forget to check out our other apps (tap our company name in iTunes for more info):\n\n - Chinese Writer\n - Chinese Audio Trainer\n - My Chinese Library (phrase books)\n - Pinyin Trainer\n - Number Trainer"

      "label": "#1 aplicaciones para el aprendizaje del inglés\n\niSmartLanguage es una nueva marca y el método más rápido de aprender una lengua. Es similar al método empleado por los niños que aprenden su lenguaje materna. Al principio ellos escuchan a los adultos, entonces aprenden a imitarlos y finalmente crean sus propias oraciones y frases. \n\nNuestro cerebro es capaz de recordar más, si la información es recibida desde más de una fuente, tales como el oído y la vista (escucha y lectura). \n\niSmartLanguage funciona tanto para principiantes como para alumnos avanzados. Los niveles de aprendizajes son todos iguales. No hay inicial o avanzado, todos son iguales. No importa qué nivel tiene usted. \n\nEste es un método natural de aprendizaje para gente que cree que no tiene talento natural para las lenguas extranjeras. \n\nEste programa le enseñará como \"to think in English\". Usted será capaz de comprender a hablantes nativos y hablará con una pronunciación correcta. Absorberá y aprenderá oraciones, expresiones y palabras de una forma natural. También aprenderá subconscientemente gramática con la repetición de una larga serie de oraciones. ¡Aprenda la autentica lengua! \n\nCada lección de Inglés Cotidiano o de Inglés de Negocios está cuidadosamente preparada por hablantes nativos de EE.UU. y Reino Unido. Los temas se basan en el tipo de situaciones que son más comunes en la vida real. \n\nCaracterísticas de iSmartLanguagemethods: \n* Método absolutamente natural de aprendizaje \n* No se aprende de memoria \n* Usted subconscientemente también aprenderá la gramática mediante la repetición de una gran cantidad de sentencias \n* No hay necesidad de un diccionario (hay traducciones palabra por palabra) \n* Capacidad de entender a los hablantes nativos y hablará con la pronunciación correcta \n* Fácil de entender cómo construir frases en inglés \n* El plan de estudios está completamente en sus manos (se puede estudiar cuando lo desee) \n\niSmartLanguage es tan simple y fácil de usar. No hay pequeñeces innecesarias. \n\nGRATIS y sin compromiso usted puede probar cómo funciona la aplicación y ver qué contiene. Cuando quiera, basta con comprar las pistas de audio para las lecciones elegidas por usted o comprar, directamente de la aplicación, todo el paquete.\n\nUna lección de muestra gratis \n* Cómo estudiar inglés: 8 minutos, 44 sentencias, 264 palabras únicas (vocabulario) \n\nEl curso completo consta de: \n* 2,5 horas de grabaciones de voz \n* 2793 palabras únicas (vocabulario) \n* un total de 9 lecciones, 2077 oraciones, 22729 palabras \n\nBONUS para el curso completo: \n* Pronunciación y deletreo (lección adicional), 7 minutos, 18 oraciones, 158 palabras nuevas \n* Verbos irregulares (7 lecciones adicionales), 42 minutos, 1377 oraciones, 1873 palabras nuevas \n\nPara obtener más información acerca del método y la aplicación, por favor no dude en visitar el sitio del producto en www.iSmartLanguage.com. \n\nSi usted desea expresar algo a nosotros, por favor, envíe un mensaje a nuestro soporte técnico directamente desde la aplicación, es la única manera en la que somos capaces de responder. En caso de que le guste esta aplicación, deje sus comentarios sobre la aplicación en App Store. Muchas gracias."

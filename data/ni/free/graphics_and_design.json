Make it yours with hundreds of uniquely designed themes and widgets.\n\n· NEVER BEFORE SEEN CONTENT ·\n\nYou've probably downloaded multiple apps promising you to customise your home screen. But, once you're there, you see the same themes over and over again. This won't be the case with Vega! We are trully passionate about design and customisation for your iOS device. That's why we've teamed up with the best themers in the scene! With Vega, your iOS device will never look the same. \n\nHundreds of wallpapers, icons and widgets will make your home screen look completely different.\n\n· THE BEST WIDGET EDITOR ·\n\nWith Vega, you can either edit widgets to make them fit your needs or create them from scratch. Your creativity is the limit! Vega even allows you to create transparent widgets to create the ultimate home screen experience!\n\nYou would like the widget to show the temperature in your area instead of the space available in your device? No problem! You can literally make it yours to fit your needs.\n\nAvailable features of our editor, among many more, include:\n\n- Weather Info. Would you like to see if tomorrow is going to be sunny? You can do it with Vega!\n- Image Layers. Would you like to see a specific photo of your album right in your home screen? You can absolutely do it. But you can also search images from a huge library of professional photos to find that specific one that you're looking for.\n- Time Info. Create your own clock!\n- Activity Info. How many steps you've done today? Or, have you exercised? \n- Tap Actions. With Tap Actions, you could for example choose to open an app when tapping on a specific area of the widget! You can create shortcuts to open your most used apps if you like!\n\n \nTo have access to Vega Premium content and functionalities, you can choose between a monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription. This is a recurring transaction that will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase and will automatically renew unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the end of your subscription. Renewals will be charged the same cost within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage your subscriptions and auto-renewal can be turned off by going to your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n\n\nTerms of Service: https://idecapps.com/privacy/\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://idecapps.com/terms/\n\n\nNOTE: Vega optionally makes use of Apple Health.

      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

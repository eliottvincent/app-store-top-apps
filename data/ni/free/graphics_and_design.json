This measuring method is already very precise and is constantly being further developed. However, this is also heavily dependent on the performance of the end device, the lighting conditions and the experience of the user. Measured values obtained from this procedure should also be checked with conventional measuring devices. Floor Plan AR is designed to help you quickly create 2D and 3D sketches. By using Floor Plan AR, the user agrees that no claims can be made against the developer due to measurement errors, inaccuracies or operating errors.\n\nIs your device compatible?\nIf your device contains a gyroscope and is compatible with ARKit, then yes!\n\nIf you have any questions or need help, please send an email to the email address provided."

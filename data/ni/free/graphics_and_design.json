      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

Seamlessly and simply create custom graphics or logo designs while letting your imagination run wild. Fluid features, easy-to-use elements, and tactile templates do all the leg work for you while you simply allow your creative juices to flow into light tapping action. \n\nSHAPE BUILDER TOOL\nOne element sets the robust logo design app apart from conventional logo makers: the shape builder tool. Vector Logo Designer is making waves in the app store by including this essential feature for the first time at your fingertips. The sophisticated shape builder tool allows you to smoothly create complex objects, selecting, merging, or erasing as you please. It makes it quicker and easier than ever before to transfer the image in your mind's eye to the screen.\n\nBRIMMING LIBRARIES\nThe options are endless, with full libraries of pre-made logo templates categorized by industry, a library of categorized vector icons, collections of hundreds of fonts and cool text features, and so much more to explore. \n\nDRAW YOUR DESIGNS\nGet as detailed as you desire with intuitive and exacting draw tools. Our first-ever built-in Virtual Stylus gives you all the freedom and power to make effortless, beautiful designs on your device by allowing you to see exactly where you're drawing and helping you accomplish tasks in tight spaces on the canvas. We take your freehand drawing to the next level with smart guides for stable, precise strokes, and the app auto connects to other strokes so you can freely lift your pen and seamlessly resume drawing on the same path. \n\nGET GRADIENT AND COLORFUL\nThe Gradient Tool and Color Picker give brilliant, vibrant, or dramatic life to your design. We offer multiple color pickers to choose from, including wheel, RGB, HSB, hex board, and palettes. You can also view linear and radial gradient styles and add and delete gradient stops.\n\nCOLOR PALETTES\nDive into an endless rainbow with never-ending color palettes. Vector Logo Designer comes with an overflowing, radiant library of color palettes and a color palette generator, so you never have to sacrifice on color combinations. Add an infinite number of colors to a palette, and we'll automatically generate colors that compliment your choices and then save your custom color palette to use in other projects. You can also upload photos and convert the image colors into a custom color palette.\n\nVECTOR ADVANTAGE\nTry out smart vector features that effortlessly elevate your logo design to professional standards. Use the Vector Pen Tool, vector Boolean functions, convert text to an editable vector path, convert stroke outlines to an editable vector path, and much more. \n\nLAYER LIKE A PRO\nLayer like a pro and take complete control of your logo design project. Add and delete layers, group objects, and re-order layers, shapes, and groups with ease. \n\nARTBOARD\nSimplify your design efforts with an easy-to-use artboard. Control the width and height and change the artboard background color for full efficiency and maximized workflow. \n\nIMPORT & EXPORT WITH EASE\nImporting and exporting should be a breeze.

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress.

Benefit from the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method, trusted by hundreds of millions adopters worldwide!\n\nPerfect for establishing a basic eating discipline, Simple is ideal for keeping yourself in good shape during self-isolation, with our educational and motivational content on staying mindful about your eating habits.\n\nPopularized by celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé, intermittent fasting is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans. It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking.

You’ve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - they’re everywhere. Zombies. There’s only one thing you can do: Run!\n\nZombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. Every run becomes a mission where you’re the hero, with our immersive audio drama putting you at the centre of your very own zombie adventure story. While you run to the perfect mix of heart-pumping audio drama and pulse-pounding songs from your own playlist, you’ll collect supplies to grow your base back home. \n\nBBC NEWS - “The only way to save yourself is to run for real.”\nWIRED - “In the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.”\nLIFEHACKER - “A really cool way to get outside and exercise.”\nCNN - “Turns exercise into a game - a terrifying, terrifying game.”\nTIME - \"Takes all the fun of a zombie game and funnels it into a fitness app.\"\n\nWHAT PLAYERS SAY:\n“Evaded all zombie mobs :-) One of my best sprints ever; this app works!”\n“This game will make you sweat. Perfect junction between game design and run tracker.”\n“Just tried @zombiesrungame and for the first time in my life I feel truly alive.”\n\nWALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE\nZombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail. It even works on treadmills! \n\nYOU ARE RUNNER 5 \nHundreds of lives are counting on you. You’ve got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse?\n\nA WORLD OF STORIES\nYou become the hero in an epic story of humanity’s struggle for survival where your running really matters, and there’s a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well. Play the first four missions for free and unlock one extra mission every week. \n\nJOIN THE ABEL TOWNSHIP RUNNER'S CLUB\nUnlock 500+ story missions for unlimited play, plus Interval Training and Airdrop Mode.\n\nYOUR OWN MIX\nChoose your own custom playlists: the story unfolds in between your tracks through a series of dynamic radio messages and voice recordings.\n\nZOMBIE CHASES\nSaving the world not exciting enough? When you hear zombies on your six, it’s time to speed up. Can you escape every mob or will you drop some of your hard-earned supplies to distract them? \n\nKEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE\nEvery run, you’ll automatically collect vital supplies like medicine and ammo. Use supplies to build your very own post-apocalypse community. Do you strengthen your defences against the zombies or build a new farm? Share the results with your friends and find out who can make the brightest future for humanity.\n\nVIEW YOUR RUNS ONLINE\nRegister on our free ZombieLink service to view and share your runs, maps and stats!\n\nSYNCS WITH APPLE HEALTH!\n\nSubscriptions are $5.99 USD/month or $39.99 USD/year.

And as you work them you see a lift and tone to the skin.\n\nSmooth, firm, lifted skin is highly coveted in a time where many hope to age gracefully. But what if there was a way to reduce fine lines and saggy skin without facelifts? The answer may be face yoga. Face yoga, which includes specific exercises and massages targeting the face, may strengthen skin and reduce signs of aging, amongst other benefits."

      "label": "Hourglass exercises for a curvy body are predominately going to consist of moves that target the obliques, or the transverse abdominals muscles. An hourglass figure typically consists of a smaller waist balanced by a larger bust and curvier hips. The emphasis of what you work on will depend on your natural shape.If you’re already slim all around, you may want to start by building muscle around your shoulders and chest area to get broader on top. If you carry weight around your midsection, you’ll likely want to prioritize whittling that away.\n\nSince it’s hard to spot-reduce fat in just one area of your body, it’s important to focus on overall weight loss if you want to drop inches from your waist. But there are some exercises and workouts that have been proven to be more successful at targeting fat around your midsection. Our workout plans will help you to tone your body with curves in all the right places. The exercises will flatten your stomach, shrink your waist to provide a small waistline, tone your thighs, make your butt rounder and hips wider."

It is important not to confuse it with the pregnancy calculator. In this case it is a test to know whether you are pregnant or not. Doing this test is an option to have a rough idea, but if you really want to know whether you are pregnant it is important to see your doctor or to go to the pharmacy to do a reliable test.\n- You will find various tips related to pregnancy week by week and early signs of pregnancy, which will be very helpful.\nWe hope that you find this app helpful and that you liked it.

      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier. Install the Dr. Kegel app to amaze your partner, stay confident & be happy. Install now & you won’t regret it!\r\n\r\nWe offer a wide range of subscription options.

Essentially, circuit weight training, or circuit bodyweight training, burns more calories than interval training, and that in turn burns a lot more calories than steady cardio. When you strength train, you burn calories. Then, your body needs to spend hours and hours afterwards rebuilding your muscles, which in turns burns even more calories.\n\nApp features:\n- 6 Workouts.\n- 11 Workout Programs, varying from 2 to 12 weeks.\n- Tracks your progress\n- View statistics about your workouts"

GRATITUDE JOURNAL\n\nA gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life.\n\nIn daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life.\n\nThe Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling.\n\nYou can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.\n\n2. POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS\n\nIf you’ve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you’ve probably heard about affirmations.\n\nPositive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves.\n\nThey give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.\n\nThe Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need.\n\nYou can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.\n\nPositive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.\n\n3. CREATE VISION BOARDS\n\nAnother super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called a dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.\n\nIn the Gratitude app, we’ll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!\n\n4. DAILY ZEN\n\nWe understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app.\n\nHere, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.\n\n5. MINDFUL MINUTES\n\nWe define the Mindful minutes as the time that you spend in the Gratitude app. You can view the mindful minutes under 'All Health Data' section in the Health app provided by Apple. Currently, the app does not read any data from the health app. We don't write any data in the health app without your consent. You can turn on the mindful minutes from the profile & settings in the Gratitude app.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.notion.so/Gratitude-App-Privacy-Policy-40195d1e9f51499c82dc8f7d06ab2a1c\nTerms of Use: https://medium.com/@priteshsankhe/terms-and-conditions-c7a676f5d884"

      "label": "Hypnotize yourself to relieve pain and stress, improve your sleep, and build better habits. Reveri's self-hypnosis can help you anywhere in just a few minutes. \n\nBACKED BY SCIENCE\n\nDr. David Spiegel, Associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine, is a psychiatrist who has taught more than 7,000 people how to better manage their minds and bodies using hypnosis. David is also Reveri's Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, bringing more than 45 years of clinical and research experience studying stress, pain, sleep, and hypnosis. He has written thirteen books, 404 scientific journal articles, and 170 book chapters. He was educated at Harvard and Yale and now teaches at Stanford. He created Reveri so that you can tap his expertise, change your mind and mind your body.\n\nCHANGE YOUR MIND\n\nUse your mind to better control your body. Reveri's focused self-hypnosis sessions cover a range of challenges like insomnia, stress, focus, pain perception, eating habits, and quitting smoking.\n\n\nWHAT IS SELF-HYPNOSIS?\n\nIn plain terms, self-hypnosis is just a naturally occurring state of highly focused attention.\n\nHave you ever gotten so caught up in a good movie or a play or a novel that you think you're in the fictional world and forget about the world around you?\n\nThat's what self-hypnosis is like.\n\nWhen you use a telephoto lens or pinch to zoom way in on a picture on your phone - you get to see incredible detail of a very specific area, but you become less aware of the surrounding context.\n\nThat's what self-hypnosis is like.\n\nMany people fear that hypnosis is a loss of control. In reality, hypnosis is a means of increasing your control over your mind and body. Our minds are powerful tools, and most of us can learn how to use them more effectively. Hypnosis gives us a pathway to alter the relationship between mind and body.\n\nREVERI MEMBERSHIP\n\nPaying Reveri members will receive:\n- Access to the complete Reveri experience\n- Self-hypnosis sessions for quitting smoking, eating well, managing pain, relieving stress, improving sleep, enhancing focus\n- Short sessions that can be used frequently to help build the concentration muscle\n\nPrices are for customers in this country. Pricing in other countries may vary and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on your country of residence.\n\nYour iTunes account will be charged at confirmation of purchase for the entire term of the plan you choose. The subscription will automatically renew unless turned off in your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the current period ends. You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings after purchase. Our 1-month and 1-year subscription plans renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Refunds will not be provided for any unused portion of a subscription term.\n\nReveri teaches the self-hypnosis skill. Nothing in the Reveri App should be considered medical advice. Users seeking medical advice should consult with their doctor or other medical professionals. Reveri does not consider the Reveri app a prescriptive device, given that there are no misleading or false medical claims in the accompanying promotional literature. Reveri provides adequate directions for lay use. The hypnosis exercises recordings labeled only for behavior modification, self-improvement, habit correction, learning technique and simple relaxation are not considered to be devices unless they are also labeled for medical or therapeutic use, per Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 335.300 Hypnotherapy Devices -Self Hypnotic Tape Recordings last revised on 08/28/12.\n\nRead our terms and conditions here:  https://www.reveri.com/terms-of-service\nRead our privacy policy here:  https://www.reveri.com/privacy-policy"

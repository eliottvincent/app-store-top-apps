      "label": "Pregnancy Test Quiz is an app, which will help you to know whether you are pregnant, thanks to a series of questions based on different pregnancy symptoms.\nIn addition to a complete pregnancy calculator, you will find different sections with relevant information concerning signs of early pregnancy in the app. You will find a section with a variety of home pregnancy tests, in addition to a wide range of tips, information about the pregnancy stages, first signs of pregnancy, teenage pregnancy, etc.\nImportant! To ensure that you are pregnant you should see a doctor or use a pregnancy test calculator from the pharmacy, since this app is merely informational based on different symptoms of pregnancy, but it doesn’t provide exact results.\n\nHow to use the app Pregnancy Test Quiz:\nIt is very easy to learn how to use this pregnancy test.\n1.- Once you have downloaded and opened the app, you will find 3 different options in the main menu of the app. On the one hand, you will find an online pregnancy test and on the other hand, 2 sections about home pregnancy tests and also tips about pregnancy signs.\n2.-Pregnancy quiz: This is the main tool of the app. Therein, you will have to answer a series of questions related to early pregnancy symptoms. At the end of the test we will show you a result based on the answers you have chosen. As we have already mentioned, this result is not fully reliable, this is why it is important to see a doctor to do a reliable pregnancy test.\n3.-Home testing: In this section we have prepared lots of articles related to home pregnancy tests that were used in the past.\n4.-Tips: Finally, we have prepared some articles with advice, tips and recommendations to make your pregnancy more bearable: which kind of food you should avoid during pregnancy, false pregnancies, when to take a pregnancy test, early symptoms of pregnancy, what to do when you are pregnant, etc.\n\nMain characteristics of the app Pregnancy Test Quiz:\nIf you use this app, you will surely ask yourself: How do I know whether I am pregnant? \n- This app enables you to do a pregnancy test online, quickly and easily. It is important not to confuse it with the pregnancy calculator. In this case it is a test to know whether you are pregnant or not. Doing this test is an option to have a rough idea, but if you really want to know whether you are pregnant it is important to see your doctor or to go to the pharmacy to do a reliable test.\n- You will find various tips related to pregnancy week by week and early signs of pregnancy, which will be very helpful.\nWe hope that you find this app helpful and that you liked it. In this case we would appreciate if you could give this app 5 stars.

If you have doubts or if the line is not very clear, you can take a photo of your test and edit it by modifying the contrast, grayscale, contrast, brightness, gamma, saturation, etc. in order to see it more clearly.\n- Photo editing: You will be able to take a photo of your test once you take a physical test, edit it, retouch it, add effects, and then share it with your loved ones so they know that you are pregnant and expecting a baby.\n\nNote: This app has been created with the purpose of help and guidance, but it does not offer scientific results or reliable results. It is a quiz for obtaining a guiding result as an aid but is never definitive. It is important that you go to the doctor or pharmacy for a 100% reliable result."

Every time your heart beats, the blood flow to your finger increases, causing more light to be absorbed. In between beats, less light is absorbed. By using your smartphone camera to capture tiny changes in reflected light from your finger, Cardiio can calculate your heart rate. \n\n**IMPORTANT TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS \n• ALWAYS hold your phone steady, keep still, and don’t talk during a measurement. \n• Make sure your fingers are not cold.\n• Cover the entire back camera lightly with your finger; Don't press too hard to avoid restricting blood flow to your finger. \n\n\nTerms of service: https://pensive-lumiere-69f59d.netlify.com/termsofuse.html\nPrivacy policy: https://pensive-lumiere-69f59d.netlify.com/privacypolicy.html\n\n\nWHAT THE PRESS SAY \n\nPC Magazine - \"… the app is simple, yet beautiful and pretty slick.\" \n\nCult of Mac - \"Cardiio is one of those apps that wows you...\" \n\nLifehacker - \"it’s a little mind-blowing...\" \n\n\nWARNING: NOT FOR MEDICAL USE\nIf knowing your pulse rate is critical to your health, you need to have your pulse taken by a medical professional.

No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.

If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "Would you like to lose weight quickly and effectively without sports and exhausting diets? Then, an intermittent fasting tracker is what you need!\n\nIntermittent fasting is a style of eating for weight loss. It is based on periodical refuse to eat. There are many plans for intermittent fasting. The most popular method is the 16:8 system - skipping food for 16 hours and 8 hours when you can eat. Eating this way makes your body burn fat efficiently.\n\nThe main advantage of fasting is that you don't have to give up your favorite food, it will be enough to skip breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Emotionally, this is much easier than, for example, fasting days on juices. In addition, there are no restrictions on products, which means that you can afford small weaknesses: desserts, fried food, bread, pastries.\n\nOur app is specifically designed to make your intermittent fasting as comfortable as possible. All you need to do is to fill in your details and choose the fasting plan that suits you best. The rest will be done by our application. It will send you a notification when to start fasting and when to indulge in food. The app will graph your weight loss and calculate your body mass index. Tracking your weight loss progress has never been easier.\n\nA simple and intuitive interface will make the process of your weight loss fun. Our widget will show you all the information you need about the current status right on your iPhone desktop.\n\nWhy is intermittent fasting so effective?\nA 16-hour refusal to eat optimizes insulin secretion, and this makes the body less sensitive to carbohydrates with a high glycemic index and reduces hunger. In moments of starvation, your body begins to burn fat reserves without being distracted by food processing. Moreover, an empty stomach can \"rest\", it boosts immunity. Some nutritionists are sure that this principle of nutrition reduces inflammatory processes in the body, regulates blood sugar levels, and improves mental function.\n\nFasting schedule (plans)\nGentle – 12:12 | 13:11 | 14:10\nModerate – 15:9 | 16:8 | 17:7\nIntense – 18:6 | 19:5 | 20:4\n\nIntegrate with the health app (HealthKit) to read and track your steps data and show them in a beautiful way.\n\n\nYou need to believe in yourself and move forward.\nEverything is achievable!"

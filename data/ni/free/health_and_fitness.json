      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier. Install the Dr. Kegel app to amaze your partner, stay confident & be happy. Install now & you won’t regret it!\r\n\r\nWe offer a wide range of subscription options.

Instead, I'm making and eating a limited number of fresh and healthy meals/snacks on a repeat basis.\n\nI made this app because I just wanted a simple way to quickly input my own custom foods (an area that is severely lacking in other free apps).  And I wanted to be able to re-use those foods as they were or to modify the \"serving\" amount.  \n\nInstead of wondering whether this is a small, medium or large apple/tomato/etc., I can add the nutrition of a tomato at 100 grams.  Then I weigh a tomato of any size, select my previously input tomato, and change the serving size to match the weight of this tomato.  The macro / calorie information updates automatically.\n\nI hope you find this app helpful in achieving your goals!"

To ensure that you are pregnant you should see a doctor or use a pregnancy test calculator from the pharmacy, since this app is merely informational based on different symptoms of pregnancy, but it doesn’t provide exact results.\n\nHow to use the app Pregnancy Test Quiz:\nIt is very easy to learn how to use this pregnancy test.\n1.- Once you have downloaded and opened the app, you will find 3 different options in the main menu of the app. On the one hand, you will find an online pregnancy test and on the other hand, 2 sections about home pregnancy tests and also tips about pregnancy signs.\n2.-Pregnancy quiz: This is the main tool of the app. Therein, you will have to answer a series of questions related to early pregnancy symptoms. At the end of the test we will show you a result based on the answers you have chosen. As we have already mentioned, this result is not fully reliable, this is why it is important to see a doctor to do a reliable pregnancy test.\n3.-Home testing: In this section we have prepared lots of articles related to home pregnancy tests that were used in the past.\n4.-Tips: Finally, we have prepared some articles with advice, tips and recommendations to make your pregnancy more bearable: which kind of food you should avoid during pregnancy, false pregnancies, when to take a pregnancy test, early symptoms of pregnancy, what to do when you are pregnant, etc.\n\nMain characteristics of the app Pregnancy Test Quiz:\nIf you use this app, you will surely ask yourself: How do I know whether I am pregnant? \n- This app enables you to do a pregnancy test online, quickly and easily. It is important not to confuse it with the pregnancy calculator. In this case it is a test to know whether you are pregnant or not. Doing this test is an option to have a rough idea, but if you really want to know whether you are pregnant it is important to see your doctor or to go to the pharmacy to do a reliable test.\n- You will find various tips related to pregnancy week by week and early signs of pregnancy, which will be very helpful.\nWe hope that you find this app helpful and that you liked it. In this case we would appreciate if you could give this app 5 stars.

      "label": "Dreaming of a flat belly, lean legs, and toned glutes? Get desired results in 30 days with Gravity Fit: choose workouts for your trouble zones or train your entire body using a ready-made program designed for your needs and parameters.\n\nWe guarantee you will achieve your goals, just like these other users:\n\n”I'd like to thank Gravity Fit for an excellent training program. You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

With our award-winning app, you can compare your technique to a professional tennis player.\n\nWe are offering a groundbreaking new way to practice your technique, on or off the court. Powered by cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision, our app is loaded with tools to improve your swing technique.  \n\nCapture your tennis swing with your iPhone! Our AI engine will automatically detect your body movement, swing curve, timing, ball impact point, and compare your swing attributes to a professional player. Get a full visual analysis instantly, in real-time, with individual feedback to fix mistakes quickly and upgrade your game. It’s like having a world-class coach in your pocket! \n\nYou will receive a performance score based on similarity to a professional player, the timing of your movement (kinetic chain), and the ball impact point.\n\nOur AI engine is self-learning and packed with the experience of world-renowned technical tennis coaches and experts.\n\nEasy setup.\nNo expensive sensors, advanced video equipment needed. Just add a tripod, or ask a friend to record your swing. \n\nPricing\nFree 7-day trial. Continue with either a monthly or a discounted yearly subscription.\n\nSevenSix Membership\nAfter the trial period, users will have to subscribe to access premium features.\n\nPremium Features\n* Access to all swing types\n* Get actionable AI Coaching advice after each stroke.\n* Individual feedback on your swing curve, timing, and impact point.\n* Score on all your strokes\n* Share your videos,  and challenge your coach or tennis pairs.\n* In-depth AI analysis\n* Access to tips on how to improve your stroke types.\n* Cloud storage to save your device hard disk capacity\n* Access to All new features\n* Achievement Badges on Tournaments and competitions\n* Rating on all your strokes and in total\n\nHow does it work?\nWhen you upload a video in our app, our AI reads your core biometrical points (feet, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, etc) and how you are moving these points during a swing. We then analyze every movement and compare it to our Pro’s swing. Any deviation, no matter how small, is pointed out in a 3D map and complex graphs. Through thousands of swings, our AI has trained its algorithms to be able to give users a score from 1 to 100, primarily focusing on swing curve, timing, and impact point.  \n\nOur AI captures the impact by listening to the sound of the player hitting a ball. At this exact frame, it sees where the wrist is compared to the body and if it is moving up or down. All compared to our Pro. \n\nEven though the tennis technique is somewhat individual, a correct tennis stroke takes into account the correct movement to create energy from the legs to your hips, shoulders, and wrist in this exact sequence often named the kinetic chain. Please note that different techniques and grips can create a different swing curve, but rest assured that Timing and Impact point is something any tennis player must practice to upgrade their technique and to prevent injuries.  \n\nSevenSix membership is available for subscription as either a monthly or yearly renewable subscription. Payment will be charged on your iTunes account upon the expiration of the free trial period. Subscription renews unless the subscription is canceled or auto-renew turned off at least 24 hours before the free trial period expires.

If you wake up at one of the calculated times, you'll rise in between 90-minute sleep cycles.\r\n\r\nSleep Calculator helps you decide when to go to bed so that you can wake at a specific time ensuring a good night’s rest, or what time you should wake up if you want to go to bed right now.\r\n\r\nIf you want to determine your real sleep cycles - our Sleep Tracker functionality allows you to track and analyze your sleep and, if done correctly, will show you your sleep progress – when you were in light, deep or REM (dream) sleep phase and the breakdown of your sleep cycles.  Snoring/noise detection can be enabled as well.\r\n\r\nOur brand new Smart Alarm will wake you up easy in the lightest sleep phase, making sure you wake up easy and rested.\r\n\r\nBedtime notifications can also be set up so that you do not miss a proper time to go to sleep."

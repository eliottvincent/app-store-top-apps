      "label": "Get ready for the run of your life. Join 10 million runners on an epic adventure!\n\nYou tie your shoes, put on your headphones, take your first steps outside. You’ve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - they’re everywhere. Zombies. There’s only one thing you can do: Run!\n\nZombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. Every run becomes a mission where you’re the hero, with our immersive audio drama putting you at the centre of your very own zombie adventure story. While you run to the perfect mix of heart-pumping audio drama and pulse-pounding songs from your own playlist, you’ll collect supplies to grow your base back home. \n\nBBC NEWS - “The only way to save yourself is to run for real.”\nWIRED - “In the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.”\nLIFEHACKER - “A really cool way to get outside and exercise.”\nCNN - “Turns exercise into a game - a terrifying, terrifying game.”\nTIME - \"Takes all the fun of a zombie game and funnels it into a fitness app.\"\n\nWHAT PLAYERS SAY:\n“Evaded all zombie mobs :-) One of my best sprints ever; this app works!”\n“This game will make you sweat. Perfect junction between game design and run tracker.”\n“Just tried @zombiesrungame and for the first time in my life I feel truly alive.”\n\nWALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE\nZombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail. It even works on treadmills! \n\nYOU ARE RUNNER 5 \nHundreds of lives are counting on you. You’ve got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse?\n\nA WORLD OF STORIES\nYou become the hero in an epic story of humanity’s struggle for survival where your running really matters, and there’s a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well. Play the first four missions for free and unlock one extra mission every week. \n\nJOIN THE ABEL TOWNSHIP RUNNER'S CLUB\nUnlock 500+ story missions for unlimited play, plus Interval Training and Airdrop Mode.\n\nYOUR OWN MIX\nChoose your own custom playlists: the story unfolds in between your tracks through a series of dynamic radio messages and voice recordings.\n\nZOMBIE CHASES\nSaving the world not exciting enough? When you hear zombies on your six, it’s time to speed up. Can you escape every mob or will you drop some of your hard-earned supplies to distract them? \n\nKEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE\nEvery run, you’ll automatically collect vital supplies like medicine and ammo. Use supplies to build your very own post-apocalypse community. Do you strengthen your defences against the zombies or build a new farm? Share the results with your friends and find out who can make the brightest future for humanity.\n\nVIEW YOUR RUNS ONLINE\nRegister on our free ZombieLink service to view and share your runs, maps and stats!\n\nSYNCS WITH APPLE HEALTH!\n\nSubscriptions are $5.99 USD/month or $39.99 USD/year.

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in.

We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

Keeping fit can also help tremendously with your self-confidence. So, shouldn’t anything count toward this goal? Well, researchers are discovering that even exercise sessions as sort as a minute may help you keep fit and active.\n\nThese equipment-free fitness routines are great to do at home and short enough for you to easily fit them into your daily schedule.

      "label": "To get the perfect hourglass body shape, you need to work your entire body, get in shape and drop any excess fat to showcase the right places on your body. In order to look in the mirror and see an enviable hourglass frame with curves in all the right places, it’s crucial to not only target your waist but your hips as well. And flattening your stomach while carving out a defined midline calls for working your entire core, butt, and thighs. This routine uses a variety of next-level planks that work muscles from head to toe as well as twisting action to shrink your waist.\n\nThis program incorporates daily waist training with core-strengthening exercises to give you that hourglass silhouette. The workouts have been highly researched and tested to make sure that you get results within that time period. The workouts are pretty simple and are the same through out the 30 days. The only thing that changes is the number of reps each week. They start out low on the first week then they increase each week after that. The goal is to strengthen your core while burning fat in your midsection. If you stick to the guide you will get results.\n\nThis is a 4-week transformation challenge and can be done training at your home or at the gym.\nAn hourglass shape is a body type where the hips and bust are wide relative to the size of the waist. This body type has recently regained popularity and is known as the sort of quintessential symbol of a woman, and a staggering portion of the population, both male and female, prefers the hourglass figure to any other body shape. Women who naturally have these types of figures will find that when they gain weight, it happens first in the hips and bust. If you aren’t a natural hourglass shape but want to be, the exercises in this workout can help.\r\n\r\nThe moves in this routine are hourglass exercises, in a sense, that can comprehensively get the body to look more voluptuous in the hips and chest, and tinier in the waistline. To get a lean and curvy shape, it takes a total body workout."

It's the perfect workout plan for any woman who want to transform their body to achieve the hourglass figure. The exercises will flatten your stomach, shrink your waist to provide a small waistline, tone your thighs, make your butt rounder and hips wider. \n\nThe hourglass has been a staple body shape for years. A slim waist with thick thighs and a round butt is the standard for feeling and looking amazing. To get this look, you’ll need to exercise multiple body parts within the same time frame. If you’re looking for a bigger butt and toned abs, our 30-day challenges will guide through four weeks of hard work, sweat, muscle building, and fat burning."

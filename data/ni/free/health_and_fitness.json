      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier.

      "label": "How many negative thoughts have been endlessly repeating in your mind?  Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self esteem and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations not only do they help make major shifts in your mindset they also serve as prompts and daily reminders on what you are truly capable of, making sure you have an amazing day, everyday.\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your unconscious mind and your conscious mind.\nThe more you strengthen this connection the more resilient you will be when difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe.\n\nAnd the best way strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\nThere are so many benefits of using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words making it easier to recognize the negative + self-doubt thought patterns holding you back. \n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n\nTo have access to the \"I am Premium\" content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

Well, unlike most of the other options, Meditopia offers more than just a short-term solution to falling asleep and de-stressing; we offer each member over 1000 deep-dive meditations that get right to the heart of what we as a people, regardless of age, background, or experience, are dealing with every day.\n\nThese meditations, offered in 9 languages, aim to cover the entire spectrum of human experiences from relationships, expectations, acceptance, and loneliness, to our body-image, sexuality, life purpose, and feelings of inadequacy. Meditopia doesn’t just want to be a band-aid for wounds which we know require permanent healing. Our goal is to create a sanctuary for you in which you can access the guidance and tools you need to build up mental resilience and peace of mind.\n\nWhat can you get with Meditopia?\n\nSleep Meditations\nYour quality of sleep affects almost every aspect of your daily life. So why not help yourself get better sleep? Try any one of our 30+ sleep meditations to learn new techniques as well as breathing and visualization exercises that you can continue to practice throughout the rest of your life to promote good sleep.\n\nBedtime Stories\nBedtime fairy stories aren’t just for kids! As you tuck yourself into bed, all warm and cozy, let us lull you to sleep with our wide selection of bedtime stories. From fairy tales and adventures to experiences in places all throughout the world, feel yourself getting pulled into these vivid and soothing stories.

Many iPhone users register their temperature data on \"Health\" app. The best solution is to use a smart thermometer that works with \"Health\" app and automatically stores measurements, but they are expensive and almost non-existent. Manual data registration is possible in \"Health\" app, but \"Health\" app is not designed for daily manual data registration. Therefore, manually entering data that occur continuously daily, such as temperature measurements, is a very time-consuming and stressful experience. This app was developed to solve such problems.\n\nThis app cannot read, view, or manage past data in \"Health\" app. This app is intended only to register data to the \"Health\" app. Please check the registered data on the \"Health\" app.\n\n\n==== Japanese(native) ====\n\niPhoneにプリインストールされているApple「ヘルスケア」アプリに体温データを(手動としては)最速で登録するためのアプリです。\n\n【想定ユーザー/ユースケース】\n\nスマート体温計を持っていない。\n\n日常的に体温(か基礎体温)を体温計で計測している。\n\n普通の体温計で測定した直後、毎回手動で測定結果を「ヘルスケア」アプリに登録する事を検討している。\n\n【オプション】\n\n単位: ℃, ℉\n\n基礎体温モード。\n\n小数点以下2桁モード。\n\n数字入力だけで自動的に完了する機能。\n\n広告バナー非表示オプション。(アプリ内課金)\n\n【その他】\n\nこのアプリ内からApple「ヘルスケア」アプリをワンタップで立ち上げ可能。\n\n動作確認や簡易バックアップを想定した端末内での履歴機能。\n\nデータ登録直後にワンタップで登録取り消しする機能。\n\nアプリ内でアプリ自身のソースコードを確認できる機能。\n\nすべての機能を無料で利用できます。\n\n自作アプリに関するバナー広告を表示します。\n\n【コンセプト】\n\n人々は体温計を用いて体温(や基礎体温)は日々頻繁に計測します。多くのiPhoneユーザーは「ヘルスケア」アプリ上に体温(や基礎体温)のデータを登録しています。「ヘルスケア」アプリと連携して自動的に計測データを保存してくれるスマート体温計を用いることが最高の解決策ではありますが、それらは高価であったり入手性が低かったりします。「ヘルスケア」アプリ上で手動でもデータ登録は可能ですが、残念ながら「ヘルスケア」アプリは計測データを日常的に手動で登録することを想定されていません。そのため、体温測定のような日々継続的に発生するデータを手動で入力することは大いに手間が掛かりストレスフルな体験になります。そうした課題を解決するためにこのアプリは開発しました。\n\nこのアプリでは「ヘルスケア」アプリ上の過去のデータの読み込みや閲覧、管理等は出来ません。このアプリは「ヘルスケア」アプリへのデータ登録のみを目的としています。登録したデータは「ヘルスケア」アプリ上で確認してください。"

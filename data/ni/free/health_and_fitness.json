Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking.

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "Fasting: It's time to get healthy together!\n\nHave you thought about trying IF intermittent fasting to achieve the healthiest you possible? The fasting method is scientifically proven to boost your health by facilitating your weight-loss goals and controlling your sleep cycle. Fasting: Get healthy together guides you with a tailored intermittent fasting tracker, a playful water tracker, a personalized meal plan as well as a hands-on recipe book.\n\nWhy IF Intermittent Fasting?\n1. Eat whatever you want\nThe beauty of intermittent fasting is that you can eat whatever you desire and still improve your personal health. You do not need a calorie counter or calorie tracker to reach your weight-loss and health goals. The fasting method only relies on you adhering to your fasting windows. With the Fasting app, you may choose the classic 16:8 fasting window or individually adapt your window from 12:12 to 23:1.    \n2. Lose weight sustainably  \nThe fasting method allows you to achieve your dream body in the most natural way. The simple Fasting app accompanies you and helps with an intuitive fasting tracker and water tracker. Thus, you will automatically eat less and drink more water for improved body recovery. No yo-yo effect risk will interfere with your integrated weight-loss tracker.\n3. Boost your sleep\nIF allows your body to find the needed rest from your daily stress. The sleep enhancement will come naturally without a need of a sleep tracker. You will be able to sleep through each sleep cycle and feel fully recovered in the morning. For better understanding of the sleep science, you may study the body academy in your intermittent fasting app.\n4. Recover automatically \nFasting for a large portion of the day will trigger ketosis and autophagy in your body. Ketosis means that your stored body fats are used as primary energy source. Autophagy is your body's natural method to repair damaged cells. The provided resting period for your stomach by not eating may lead to a healthy immune system. Likewise, your skin may improve and your allergy exposure may diminish. In the long run, IF intermittent fasting may support your anti-aging efforts and boost longevity. \n5. Enhance your mindfulness\nIntermittent fasting introduces a new angle on your body and soul. Your body to mind connection will prosper and help you stay calm in stressful situations and make decisions easier. Falling asleep smoothly, finding time to exercise, taking time to resonate - fasting boosts the healthiest you!\n\nWhy Fasting: Get healthy together?\nThe intermittent fasting app is a health tracker that allows you to reach your goals faster. It is your health mate with a water tracker, personalized meal plan, recipe book and weight-loss tracker. If you open the vast recipe book, you will quickly realize the beauty of IF intermittent fasting. You may eat whatever you like.

The water pyramid divides daily beverages into six healthy levels, which can help you understand whether your water intake is in line with health guidelines.\n\n== Features ==\n\n**Track Daily Water Intake**\nHiWater helps you quickly log your daily water intake, and also helps you set a personalized daily hydration goal.\n\n**Water Pyramid**\nJust like the food pyramid, the water pyramid classifies beverages into different health levels. HiWater helps you analyze the structure of your water intake to avoid consuming too many beverages and promote good health. The water pyramid model comes from the Healthy Beverage Guidelines proposed by experts at the Harvard School of Public Health and related research.\n\n**Smart Reminder**\nHiWater will remind you to hydrate when your body goes into dehydration. With HiWater's powerful notification system, you can set different rules for weekdays and weekends. HiWater also supports iOS 15 time-sensitive notifications.\n\n**Powerful System Integration**.\nHiWater supports Shortcuts, Siri suggestions, and Home Screen widgets. With these features, power users can complete daily water tracking without even opening the app.\n\n**Apple Watch App**\nHiWater comes with a high-quality Apple Watch app. You can quickly check your body hydration on your watch and keep track of your water intake on your wrist. It also comes with a beautiful set of watch face complications.\n\n**Data Sync**\n- Supports iCloud sync. The data you logged is stored safely and securely.\n- Supports iOS Health data sync, including water and nutrient data.\n- Seamlessly works with HiCoffee. When you log coffee in HiCoffee, the water data will be automatically synced to HiWater. (HiCoffee is another app for tracking caffeine intake and needs to be purchased separately)\n\n\n== Purchase Notes ==\n\nHiWater's basic features are free and can be used all the time. But you can unlock premium features by joining a membership.\n\n** About Membership Subscription **\nHiWater's auto-renewal subscriptions can be found on the Settings > View Membership page (prices may vary by region).

      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier.

It is important not to confuse it with the pregnancy calculator. In this case it is a test to know whether you are pregnant or not. Doing this test is an option to have a rough idea, but if you really want to know whether you are pregnant it is important to see your doctor or to go to the pharmacy to do a reliable test.\n- You will find various tips related to pregnancy week by week and early signs of pregnancy, which will be very helpful.\nWe hope that you find this app helpful and that you liked it.

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

Staring at pregnancy tests day after day to the point where you might even be seeing an imaginary second line? Get a little more assurance with the Pregnancy Test Checker app! With our neat little tool, you can take or import a photo of your pregnancy test stick and apply photo effects to make that (hopefully visible) second line easier to see. Current effects include brighten, contrast, grayscale, invert, exposure, gamma, hue, saturation and sharpen and we are continuing to work on adding more features!\n\nWe also provide a community where you can share photos of your tests or other TTC-related photos that other users can vote and comment on. You can also do the same for others!\n\nWe realize how stressful and frustrating the process of becoming pregnant can be, especially for those of you that have tried so hard and yearn for that pregnancy test to finally be positive after months or even years of disappointment. As such, we added a baby dust feature that we hope will provide a little comfort and encouragement to you during your journey to become pregnant.\n\nShould you run into any issues, we would sincerely appreciate it if you could send feedback to us first in the app instead of leaving a negative review and we will work to address your issue as quickly as possible. Thank you!"

      "label": "En INDYA planificamos la nutrición de cualquier persona que tenga un reto deportivo con el objetivo de mejorar su rendimiento. Lo hacemos de manera rigurosa y muy personalizada a través de una herramienta exclusiva que nos permite configurar tu planificación nutricional adaptándola a tu objetivo deportivo, necesidad calórica, necesidad de macronutrientes, horarios, entrenamientos, gustos, alergias, conciencias, nivel de cocina, tiempo, hábitos de vida, trabajo, etc.\n\nAdemás ahora puedes sincronizar tus datos Apple Salud con INDYA para tener una información todavía más afinada, y que sea mucho mas sencillo recoger tus datos de peso, frecuencia cardiaca, tiempo de descanso, etc.\n\nPara ello, primero necesitamos que completes un formulario en el que te pediremos la información que necesitamos para que diseñar tu plan totalmente personalizado en menos de 48h.\n\nUna vez al mes, tendrás opción de enviar a tu nutricionista tus nuevas necesidades para que pueda reajustar tu nueva planificación nutricional y publicártela en la app.\n\nCon esta aplicación tendrás siempre a mano el menú semanal que los nutricionistas deportivos de IND han configurado en tu última sesión. La App de IND facilita muchísimo el cumplimiento de tu planificación mostrándote:\n\n• La descripción de cada receta con su foto, ingredientes, cantidades, elaboración, indicadores nutricionales, etc.\n• Añadidos a cada comida: cafés, postres, acompañamientos, suplementos...\n• La lista de la compra con las cantidades exactas para realizar tu menú semanal\n• Entrenamientos que tienes cada día con el preentreno o postentreno planificados\n• Indicadores nutricionales de tu plan\n\nAdemás, ofrece una serie de funcionalidades que ayudan a alimentar tu perfil para que tus próximos menús sean cada vez más personalizados:\n\n• Marcación del cumplimiento de cada comida y cada entrenamiento\n• Marcación de tus recetas Favoritas\n• Cambio de recetas automático sin alterar ni 1 kcal tu arquitectura nutricional\n\nPero la nutrición no funciona de forma aislada, hay muchas variables en tu vida que influyen en ella y en tu rendimiento. Es por eso que en IND controlamos las 6 variables más importantes del deportista:\n\n1. Alimentación y Nutrición\n2. Composición Corporal\n3. Entrenamientos\n4. Descanso\n5. Biomarcadores\n6. Motivación\n\nEn esta aplicación podrás visualizar a través de intuitivos gráficos cuál está siendo tu evolución en cada una de estas 6 variables: cómo está evolucionando tu porcentaje de grasa, cuántas kcal estás comiendo en cada menú, cuánto estás cumpliendo, cómo estás entrenando, descansando y muchos más datos que compararán tu estado actual con tu estado inicial al comenzar el reto.\n\nPor último, pero no menos importante, desde la app tendrás contacto directo con tu nutricionista, pedirle una consulta online o solicitar cualquier duda sobre tu plan.\n\nTérminos de uso: www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nTérminos y condiciones: https://getindya.com/terminos-y-condiciones/"

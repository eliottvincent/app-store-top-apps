      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier.

      "label": "LESS - Alcohol Tracker\n\nLess is a simple, elegant, intuitive tool to help people who drink alcohol do so more mindfully, and make space for more drink-free days. From the creators of ZERO, the top rated fasting app, Less makes it easy to track your alcohol intake so you can stay aware of how much you drink and when. It’s a science-based approach to taking control of your consumption. As the saying goes, “What gets measured gets managed.”\n\nThis app is a judgment-free zone. It’s designed to help anyone who wants to moderate alcohol consumption, no matter what the reason. Whether you’re trying to sail through social situations without overdoing it, overwhelmed by the ocean of work functions involving alcohol, or seeking to chart a course toward better health, Less is your companion to navigate these stormy waters.\n\n**This is v1 of “the drinking buddy that helps you drink less.” We’re rapidly iterating and improving, so we welcome feedback to help make Less as upbeat, engaging, and helpful as possible.**\n\nMEET LES AND LESLIE\n\nChoose to experience the journey toward mindful consumption as either Les or Leslie. You’re the captain of this ship, and every decision is yours. As you log drinks, your daily intake affects the weather while your weekly intake affects your speed. Stay under your daily limit to keep the skies sunny. Stay under your weekly limit to keep the wind at your back. If you exceed your limits, you’ll run into stormy weather and slow your progress.\n\nTRACK YOUR JOURNEY\n\nSET LIMITS. Our algorithm will recommend a weekly limit, but you can customize that limit up or down to work at your own pace. \n\nLOG DRINKS WITH A TAP. Quickly and easily log each drink from the homescreen, or use the widget to add drinks without opening the app for a more discrete tracking experience. \n\nBUILD STREAKS. Less tracks how many drink-free days you rack up in a row so you can visualize your progress. \n\nREVIEW YOUR WEEK. See when you drank and how much. Use this information to inform your choices moving forward.\n\nREVIEW YOUR MONTH. The calendar view lets you see your entire consumption history so you can see the big picture of your alcohol intake.\n\nCHART YOUR PROGRESS. Less transforms your inputs into easy-to understand graphs so you can see how your habits evolve over time.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n\nWith Less, you can…\n\n...Adjust your weekly limits up or down depending on your goals.\n\n...View and edit your history. If you forgot to log a drink, or logged one incorrectly, you can adjust the number from the “past days” screen. \n\n...View key statistics like your 7-day rolling average, your 28-day rolling average, and total drink-free days since joining.\n\n...See how much drinking is costing you. Less estimates how much money you spend on alcohol. \n\n...See how alcohol impacts your health. Less estimates how many calories you consume from alcohol.\n\n...Compare streaks. Track drink-free days and weeks within your limit. Compare your current streak to your longest one. \n\nLEARN MORE IN OUR TIPS TAB\n\nDig deep with articles, podcasts, and snackable advice, curated by our team of experts. Read studies from trusted sources about the benefits of drinking less. Listen to podcasts from the top minds in nutrition. Find mocktail recipes to help you drink thoughtfully without sacrificing your social life. \n\nBecome part of a global community of people taking this journey toward more mindful drinking habits and drink-free days. \n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of Service: www.lessdrinks.com/terms-of-use\nPrivacy Policy: www.lessdrinks.com/privacy-policy"

For example, HabitMinder will remind you to do breathing exercises or a quick meditation session. It can also track your hydration, encourage you to exercise or go to the gym, and much more.\n\nThe app has more than 50 pre-defined positive and healthy habits to track - it will get you started for good.

After all, water makes up 75% of your muscles, 83% of your blood, and 90% of your brain, so you can’t go wrong. Good hydration promotes healthy skin, it makes your brain stronger, and it can help you lose weight.\n\n• Breathing/Mindfulness – relieve feelings of stress and tension through breathing and mindfulness exercises. This will improve your focus and your mood as well as having a positive impact on your physical health.\n\n• Exercise – you need to exercise to stay fit, lose weight, and stay physically and mentally healthy. HabitMinder can't do the exercise for you but it will help you stay on schedule.\n\n• Stretching – stretching is an essential part of being fit and healthy. It can also help you relax so should be part of your daily routine.\n\n• Stand – it will surprise you when you learn just how much of your day you spend sitting down. Your attention will improve, you will feel more energised, and you will improve your physical health by getting into one simple habit – standing up frequently and regularly.\n\n• Squats – your partner will love this habit and so will you. Your muscles will become firmer and more toned, and you will feel stronger. Squats can even help you lose weight.\n\n• Eat healthily – everyone knows the benefits of eating healthily. Getting into a regular and committed healthy eating habit is easier said than done, however. HabitMinder is the solution – it will help keep your healthy eating plans on track.\n\n• Sleep more – sleep is crucial for your physical and mental health and wellbeing. Even 30 minutes more per night will have a positive impact.\n\nDownload today, HabitMinder - your daily habit tracker.\n\n---\nOne time In-App Purchase available to unlock Premium Features.\n\nOptional auto-renewing yearly Premium Subscription is available (price varies by territory, includes 7 day free trial) located on the Upgrade page.

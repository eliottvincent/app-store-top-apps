      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier.

Add medications administered to understand how they affect temperature and so you know when and if you need more. \nComments: Add any additional notes that may be relevant to your temperature or illness.\nPhotos: Strange rash? Feeling better? Select a picture from your phone’s gallery, or take a new picture to add to your timeline.\n\nThe Thermo app also provides the following useful features: \n\nReminder: Set a reminder to take your temperature at certain hours of the day or in specific time increments. \nManual Temperature: If you don’t own Withings Thermo, or simply want to enter additional temperature readings, you can do just that. Simply select “Manual Temperature” and add your details. \nThermo and Apple Health work seamlessly together, so you can retrieve all your health data in one place for easier health tracking.\n\nIf you log a high temperature reading, Thermo can help you assess the severity of your fever.\n\nInsights: Thermo provides fever management advice to help you monitor temperature and symptoms\nAsk Thermia™: An educational tool developed by Boston Children’s Hospital, Thermia™ provides recommendations on when it’s time to see a doctor and as well as advice on proper  medications and dosages."

      "label": "Regular to moderate physical activity is incredibly beneficial to overall health and prostatitis in particular. Of course, you can work out for days on simulators in the gym with a personal trainer and get a body that even Franco Colombo will envy. However, having a great figure and excellent health are two big differences.\n\nModern research has proven the unconditional benefits of exercise for prostatitis. For instance in the work of Liu Y. et al. “Does physical activity reduce the risk of prostate cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis” the results of 43 scientific works on this topic were studied at once. And this is neither more nor less - 88 294 clinical cases! And they all have proven that physical activity (both professional and at home) is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of prostate cancer.\n\nThe most popular are Kegel exercises for men. You might be surprised, since Kegel gymnastics has traditionally been referred to women. However, there is also a male version, which allows not only to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles at home, but also to solve the problem of frequent urination, improve sex life, make an erection more stable, etc.\n\nWhen should you start doing Kegel exercises? The universal answer is: right now. The prostate gland is a very insidious organ that can “keep silent” about its problems for years. You may not even suspect that prostatitis is already developing. And when it manifests itself, it will be too late to engage in prevention, and solving the problem that has arisen is quite expensive. Therefore, if until now you have not done specialized gymnastics, it's time to start!\n\nAnd it doesn't matter at all how old you are: 20-30, maybe 40 or 50, maybe 60 or 70 years old... The Kegel exercises will bring you unconditional benefits. And if you do not want to perceive them as prevention of prostatitis (sometimes they say “I'm not that old for that!”), think of it as a useful warm-up with stretching elements. After all, every man should from time to time stop working like a dog, get up and warm up thoroughly. It is useful, pleasant and uplifting, and, nonetheless, beneficial for your prostate gland.\n\nAnd you have everything you need for a successful start. After all, you have in your hands a universal assistant of every self-respecting man. Just open the Dr. Prost app and follow the simple instructions. Each exercise is accompanied by clear pictures shown in the form of animation. Click on \"\"start\"\" and than repeat the movements of the virtual personal trainer. If you are not successful, you can stop and carefully study each movement of the exercise. You can also fill out a questionnaire to help you track your progress and overall health. \n\nFor the prevention of prostatitis, you do not need anything other than your own body, space in the room, which is enough to perform some elements in the lying position, and a little bit of desire. But the main thing is the desire to become healthier in a natural way. After all, your future is only in your hands.\n\nThe content of all content presented in the application is for informational purposes only.

      "label": "NC° Birth Control · NC° Plan Pregnancy\n\n○ The #1 Rated Birth Control & Ovulation Temperature Tracker App in the US & UK\n○ Subscription-based to protect your data. We will never sell your personal data.\n○ The only birth control app cleared by the FDA and CE marked as a medical device\n○ Adaptive tracker technology that uses your unique cycle and basal temperature to track ovulation so you know exactly when you're fertile, and what days you can and cannot get pregnant\n○ Daily insights into your fertility and personal ovulatory pattern to help with your birth control or natural family planning needs\n○ Scientifically proven to be effective: 93% effective with typical use, and 98% effective with perfect use\n○ Switch modes and use to plan a pregnancy. Great for couples to follow ovulation and trying to conceive \n\nNatural Cycles is not just a period or basal body temperature tracker. Most other fertility tracking apps assume your cycle is 28 days long. This means the fertile window they give you is not tailored to you. Our algorithm significantly reduces the risk of you being assigned an incorrect fertile day as it uses your personal data. This reduces the risk of unwanted pregnancy, or can help you plan pregnancy and conceive with greater precision. \n\nBIRTH CONTROL, FERTILITY & OVULATION TRACKING PRICING PLANS \n○ Yearly Plan (Recommended): $99.99/year.\n○ Monthly Plan: $12.99/month.\n○ A subscription is needed to use the сycle tracker, and while a free demo is available, we recommend a minimum of 2-3 cycles for Natural Cycles to be most effective.\n○ We charge a subscription in order to protect you and your data. Free apps need to make money, so many of them do so by sharing or selling their users’ data to third parties for advertising. We will never sell your data because our users' privacy is paramount to us.\n\nPRECAUTIONS\n○ Natural Cycles fertility tracker does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Use a condom to protect against STIs.\n○ No method of birth control is 100% effective, even when using the birth control app perfectly you can still get pregnant.\n○ Natural Cycles is for women over the age of 18.\n○ Natural Cycles is only available as a method of birth control in the US and in Europe.\n○ To use Natural Cycles, you need to understand English or one of the supported languages.\n\nNatural Cycles is not just a period and ovulation tracker app, but your fertility partner that can meet your needs, at any cycle or life stage. Still not sure? Download the app and test out our Demo Mode. The app supports syncing with Apple Health. \n\n*E.

      "label": "Milestones matter! CDC has released updated milestones and two new checklists (15 and 30 months) to better support your child’s development*. Existing app users can find their checklist history on the homepage under “View Checklist History”. Track your child’s milestones from age 2 months to 5 years with CDC’s easy-to-use checklists; get tips from CDC to support your child’s development; and find out what to do if you ever have concerns about your child's development.\n\nFrom birth to age 5, your child should reach milestones in how he or she plays, learns, speaks, acts and moves. \n\nFeatures:\n\n• Add a Child -- enter personalized information about your child or multiple children\n• Milestone Tracker -- track your child’s development by looking for important milestones using an interactive, checklist \n• Milestone Photos and Videos -- due to previous social distancing restrictions, photos and videos to support the updated milestones have been delayed, but will be added in a future update.\n• Tips and Activities – support your child’s development at every age\n• When to Act Early – know when it’s time to “act early” and talk with your child’s doctor about developmental concerns\n• Appointments – keep track of your child’s doctors’ appointments and get reminders about recommended developmental screenings\n• Milestone Summary  – get a summary of your child’s milestones to view, and share with or email to your child’s doctor and other important care providers \n\nFor more information and free tools to help you track your child’s milestones, visit www.cdc.gov/ActEarly.\n\n* This milestone checklist is not a substitute for a standardized, validated developmental screening tool. These developmental milestones show what most children (75% or more) can do by each age. Subject matter experts selected these milestones based on available data and expert consensus.\n\nCDC does not collect or share any personal information that can be used to identify you or your child."

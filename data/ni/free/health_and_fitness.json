Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking.

For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

Our workout routines will work your entire body, sculpting your muscles and shredding excess fat.\n\nYou don't need a gym membership to melt that unwanted flab and look fit. In fact, you don't even need equipment.\nWith minimal equipment and the convenience of home, these high-energy home workouts for women can help you get fit and lean fast. Combining cardio and strength, this full body workout burns calories fast. It can be carried out at home with no equipment. The strength exercises uses only body weight, making sure the female watchers will tone but not build their muscles.\n\nBodyweight exercises are realistic and functional, meaning that they help us strengthen our muscles that we use in our daily lives. Every bodyweight exercise involved utilizes multiple muscle groups, gets your heart rate pumping, and burns tons of calories. Essentially, circuit weight training, or circuit bodyweight training, burns more calories than interval training, and that in turn burns a lot more calories than steady cardio. When you strength train, you burn calories. Then, your body needs to spend hours and hours afterwards rebuilding your muscles, which in turns burns even more calories.\n\nApp features:\n- 6 Workouts.\n- 11 Workout Programs, varying from 2 to 12 weeks.\n- Tracks your progress\n- View statistics about your workouts"

When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head.

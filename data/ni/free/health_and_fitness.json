The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier. Install the Dr. Kegel app to amaze your partner, stay confident & be happy. Install now & you won’t regret it!\r\n\r\nWe offer a wide range of subscription options.

To ensure that you are pregnant you should see a doctor or use a pregnancy test calculator from the pharmacy, since this app is merely informational based on different symptoms of pregnancy, but it doesn’t provide exact results.\n\nHow to use the app Pregnancy Test Quiz:\nIt is very easy to learn how to use this pregnancy test.\n1.- Once you have downloaded and opened the app, you will find 3 different options in the main menu of the app. On the one hand, you will find an online pregnancy test and on the other hand, 2 sections about home pregnancy tests and also tips about pregnancy signs.\n2.-Pregnancy quiz: This is the main tool of the app. Therein, you will have to answer a series of questions related to early pregnancy symptoms. At the end of the test we will show you a result based on the answers you have chosen. As we have already mentioned, this result is not fully reliable, this is why it is important to see a doctor to do a reliable pregnancy test.\n3.-Home testing: In this section we have prepared lots of articles related to home pregnancy tests that were used in the past.\n4.-Tips: Finally, we have prepared some articles with advice, tips and recommendations to make your pregnancy more bearable: which kind of food you should avoid during pregnancy, false pregnancies, when to take a pregnancy test, early symptoms of pregnancy, what to do when you are pregnant, etc.\n\nMain characteristics of the app Pregnancy Test Quiz:\nIf you use this app, you will surely ask yourself: How do I know whether I am pregnant? \n- This app enables you to do a pregnancy test online, quickly and easily. It is important not to confuse it with the pregnancy calculator. In this case it is a test to know whether you are pregnant or not. Doing this test is an option to have a rough idea, but if you really want to know whether you are pregnant it is important to see your doctor or to go to the pharmacy to do a reliable test.\n- You will find various tips related to pregnancy week by week and early signs of pregnancy, which will be very helpful.\nWe hope that you find this app helpful and that you liked it. In this case we would appreciate if you could give this app 5 stars. Please contact us if you can find any mistake or if you have any suggestions for improvement.\n\nInformation note: This tool should be used as informational assistance, but it should never be considered as a reliable result, since its effectiveness is not scientifically proven and the result is not precise."

      "label": "To get the perfect hourglass body shape, you need to work your entire body, get in shape and drop any excess fat to showcase the right places on your body. In order to look in the mirror and see an enviable hourglass frame with curves in all the right places, it’s crucial to not only target your waist but your hips as well. And flattening your stomach while carving out a defined midline calls for working your entire core, butt, and thighs. This routine uses a variety of next-level planks that work muscles from head to toe as well as twisting action to shrink your waist.\n\nThis program incorporates daily waist training with core-strengthening exercises to give you that hourglass silhouette. The workouts have been highly researched and tested to make sure that you get results within that time period. The workouts are pretty simple and are the same through out the 30 days. The only thing that changes is the number of reps each week. They start out low on the first week then they increase each week after that. The goal is to strengthen your core while burning fat in your midsection. If you stick to the guide you will get results.\n\nThis is a 4-week transformation challenge and can be done training at your home or at the gym.\nAn hourglass shape is a body type where the hips and bust are wide relative to the size of the waist. This body type has recently regained popularity and is known as the sort of quintessential symbol of a woman, and a staggering portion of the population, both male and female, prefers the hourglass figure to any other body shape. Women who naturally have these types of figures will find that when they gain weight, it happens first in the hips and bust. If you aren’t a natural hourglass shape but want to be, the exercises in this workout can help.\r\n\r\nThe moves in this routine are hourglass exercises, in a sense, that can comprehensively get the body to look more voluptuous in the hips and chest, and tinier in the waistline. To get a lean and curvy shape, it takes a total body workout."

With over 20,000 trained, experienced, and accredited therapists covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it.\n \n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 20,000 licensed, accredited, and highly experienced therapists\n• Match with an available therapist who best fits your needs\n• Unlimited private one on one communication with your therapist\n• Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secure messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars\n \nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n \nLICENSED AND TRAINED therapistS & THERAPISTS\nThere are over 20,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n \nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n \nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n \nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n \nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason."

Built by doctors and engineers to optimize your life expectancy.\n\nKyla connects you with doctors who perform medical-grade tests then challenge you to improve those results through daily goals. Based on a robust AI engine of millions of disease combinations, Kyla helps identify your health risks and gives you the tools to improve them over time. Measure. Plan. Lifestyle.\n\nThe Kyla app brings together our team of doctors, developers, and AI scientists to give each individual the power to understand their health from a new perspective along with simple goals and clear follow-ups to improve.\n\nIf you are sick now, chat with a doctor and get prescriptions, labs, referrals for tests, and for specialists.\n\nNext, optimize your nutrition, exercise, sleep, mental health, and more.\n\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nUnlike a symptom checker, you can chat with Kyla any time and get a diagnosis and a treatment plan from a medically licensed doctor. That includes prescriptions, labs, and referrals.\n\nNext, Kyla learns about your medical history and lifestyle to create a truly personalized healthcare journey just for you. Not just treating you when you are sick, but preventing you from getting sick in the first place.\n\nKyla focuses on daily health, education, healthy habits, medically-validated tests, and preventative screenings.\n\nKyla monitors your data from in-app cards, chat, labs, imaging, mobile devices, and health tracking apps. When we find something to improve, we work with our team of doctors to create an optimal plan for you that both prevents illness and extends your longevity.\n\nOnce you take care of the basics, you get access to cutting-edge life extension services like advanced cardiovascular screenings, cancer screenings, cryonics, Whole Genome Sequencing (DNA), and more.\n\n\n\nWe Treat:\n\nAllergies\nAbdominal Pain\nAcid Reflux\nArthritis\nAnxiety\nAsthma\nBack pain / Neck Pain\nBowel / Digestive issues\nBronchitis\nBlood pressure - Hypertension / Hypotension\nCold and Flu\nCholesterol conditions - Hyperlipidemia\nConstipation\nCough\nCOVID-19\nChest Pain\nDepression\nDermatology\nDiarrhea\nHigh Blood Sugar - Diabetes\nFatigue\nFever\nFlu\nGout\nHeadaches\nHPV\nInfluenza\nInsomnia\nJoint Pain / Swelling\nLab results\nMedication Refills\nMigraines\nRespiratory diseases\nUTI and Bladder Infections\nPoison Ivy / Oak\nQuit Smoking\nRash\nStress\nSinusitis\nSkin injury\nSkin health\nSore throat\nSprain\nSTI’s - herpes\nUrination Issues - UTI\nYeast infection\nThousands of other conditions\n\n\nWhy trust Kyla?\nWe have treated over 350,000 patients.\nWe are HIPAA compliant.\nWe never sell your personal health information.\nWe have built-in safety tools, like checking for drug interactions.\n\n\nWho are the providers?\nOur providers are US-based, board-certified physicians (MDs), PAs, and NPs.\n\n\nDoes Kyla help with diet/meal plan?\nThere are many diets out there like Keto, Paleo, Atkins, Whole30, Low Carb, Mediterranean, Fasting. Just like having a personal dietician/therapist, Kyla can help you eat healthy and tasty while finding the diet that improves the most important thing - your longevity.\n\n\nDoes Kyla help with exercise?\nKyla helps you stay healthy. Going to the gym for a run/jog is not the best option for all. Neither is having six-pack abs. For some people, it is yoga or swimming. Find out what it is for you.\n\n\nWhat pharmacies do you prescribe to?\nSafeway, Vons, Albertsons, Walgreens, CVS, and more."

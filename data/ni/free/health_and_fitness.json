I designed my growwithjo fitness and nutrition app to make it easy and fun for ladies all around the world to achieve their health and fitness goals. \n\nMy app has workouts that can be done at home with minimal or no equipment, so you can get a sweat on any time, anywhere! \n\nI have 3 amazing trainers on the app who helped me create a huge variety of workouts for you - there are 30+ unique training programs for you to choose from. \n\nYou can choose the length of time you work out for, so if you’re pushed for time you can select a short workout and get it done in as little as 12 minutes! \n\nThere are workouts for weight-loss, strength building, toning and improving your fitness level. Whatever your goal may be, there’s something for you :) \n\nNot only is my app jam-packed with challenging workouts, it also has an awesome meal plan feature. \n\nThis provides you with 3 meals a day plus a snack. You can swap out ingredients you don’t like, and create a super-easy grocery list to take to the store. These plans were designed to ensure you cook for 25 minutes or less each day to help you slot these meals into your everyday routine. \n\nAll the macronutrients are broken down to help you understand what you are nourishing your body with. \n\nThe meal plans and recipes include my go-to banana pancakes, quesadillas with a protein of your choice, my cherry-chocolate milkshake and so much more! \n\nThis meal plan is there to support you to make better food choices, NOT to restrict you from your favorite foods. The meals are adjustable, delicious and full of goodness, helping you fuel your amazing body!\n\nSign up today and come Grow With Jo :) \n\nGrow with Jo works with Apple Health to record your calories burned after workout.\n\nGrow with Jo is following well known worldwide health publications rules to propose you healthy diet plan.

Here’s how:\n\n• Record everything – runs, rides, hikes, yoga and over 30 other sport types. Think of Strava as the homebase of your movement.\n\n• Discover anywhere – our Routes tool uses de-identified Strava data to intelligently recommend popular routes based on your preferences. You can also build your own.\n\n• Build a support network – Strava’s about celebrating movement. Here you’ll find your community and cheer each other on.\n\n• Train smarter – get data insights to understand your progress and see how you improve. Your Training Log is the record of all your workouts.\n\n• Move safer – share your real-time location with loved ones while outdoors for an extra layer of safety.\n\n• Sync your favorite apps and devices – Strava is compatible with thousands of them (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin – you name it).\n\n• Join and create challenges – join millions in monthly challenges to chase new goals, collect digital badges and stay accountable.\n\n• Embrace the unfiltered – your feed on Strava is filled with real efforts from real people. That’s how we motivate each other.\n\n• Whether you’re a world-class athlete or a total beginner, you belong here. Just record and go.\n\nStrava includes both a free version and a subscription version with premium features.\nStrava uses HealthKit to export your Strava activities into the Health app and to read heart rate and biometric data.\n\nYou can subscribe and pay on the App Store, using your Apple ID. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renew may be turned off after purchase by going to the ‘Manage Subscription’ page in settings.

In this case, the best idea is to go to a professional doctor or a pharmacy to do a pregnancy test, but if you want to have an approximate orientation before going, you can do the \"Am I pregnant quiz\" we have prepared.\n\nMain characteristics:\n- Before the first signs of pregnancy, if you want to know the approximate possibility to become pregnant, you can use this pregnancy test calculator to eliminate your doubts.\n- It is an online pregnancy test, focused on 15 questions about the signs of early pregnancy during the first weeks, which will give you a guiding result.\n- If you are tired of home pregnancy tests, you can try to take this questionnaire. You will have an approximate result by only responding to some simple questions related to the early pregnancy signs in first weeks of pregnancy.\n\nWhich kind of questions will you find in this home pregnancy test?\nAs we have explained before, all questions are focused on early pregnancy symptoms. Therefore, you will find some questions related to fatigue, irritability, sickness or vomiting, appetite, heartburn, constipation, etc. In short, a collection of the most relevant questions to be able to have an orientation about your situation.\nIf you ask yourself how to know whether you are pregnant, this app will help you to shed some light and have a rough idea. We hope that this free pregnancy test helps you in discovering a positive or negative pregnancy test result or whatever you are looking for.\nIf, on the contrary, you want to know how to get pregnant, this is not the aim of this app, therefore we recommend you to search for other apps or information of a professional doctor, since the aim of this app is to check your pregnancy status when having some sign of pregnancy to know whether you are pregnant or not.\n\nNote: This app is not a reliable pregnancy test, but simply a questionnaire to obtain an approximate result, but never definite. It is important that you go to the doctor or pharmacy for a 100% reliable result when experiencing signs of being pregnant.\n\nLegal note: This app and its content have been created by Smiko.

      "label": "The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.\n\nWith a gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.\n\nTo live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.\n\nAnd, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.\n\nHere are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:\n\n1. GRATITUDE JOURNAL\n\nA gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life.\n\nIn daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life.\n\nThe Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling.\n\nYou can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.\n\n2. POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS\n\nIf you’ve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you’ve probably heard about affirmations.\n\nPositive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves.\n\nThey give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.\n\nThe Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need.\n\nYou can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.\n\nPositive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.\n\n3. CREATE VISION BOARDS\n\nAnother super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called a dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.\n\nIn the Gratitude app, we’ll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!\n\n4. DAILY ZEN\n\nWe understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app.\n\nHere, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.\n\n5. MINDFUL MINUTES\n\nWe define the Mindful minutes as the time that you spend in the Gratitude app. You can view the mindful minutes under 'All Health Data' section in the Health app provided by Apple. Currently, the app does not read any data from the health app. We don't write any data in the health app without your consent. You can turn on the mindful minutes from the profile & settings in the Gratitude app.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.notion.so/Gratitude-App-Privacy-Policy-40195d1e9f51499c82dc8f7d06ab2a1c\nTerms of Use: https://medium.com/@priteshsankhe/terms-and-conditions-c7a676f5d884"

      "label": "Download our virtual therapist app and start our smoking cessation program now!\n\nUnlike others, this application is NOT designed just to count cigarettes, days without smoking, money saved… nor do we bombard you with unpleasant photos of smokers’ lungs or other strategies that deep down you know DON’T WORK or aren’t an important enough reason for you to quit. \n\nThis is a serious programme to help you give up smoking, endorsed by the Official College of Psychologists (COPLP) and developed in collaboration with the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Our programme will help you quit smoking progressively in a controlled way thanks to the help of a Virtual Therapist who will accompany you in the different stages of treatment: initial evaluation, daily tasks, D Day and the days following quitting.\n\nStop Tabaco Mobile Trainer is a new way of helping smokers who want to give up their habit and there’s no other programme like it. It deals with the components of cognition, emotion and habit that maintain your addiction. \n\n* With Stop Tabaco Mobile Trainer:\n\n- We tackle the two needs that have been created: psychological and physical.\n- We manage your ability to give up smoking by teaching you behavioural strategies and mental resources.\n- You’ll strengthen your motivation to give up smoking.\n- You’ll learn to manage anxiety and control or modify your environment in this new stage of your life as a non-smoker.\n- You’ll be able to decisively confront difficult situations, especially in the days after quitting smoking.\n\nHundreds of patients have already given up smoking with our programme. If they can do it, YOU CAN TOO! \n\nBelow we will describe the application’s different stages and sections:\n\n* INITIAL EVALUATION. FIRST STEPS\n\nIn the initial stage the application carries out various tests to gather relevant information, such as:\n\n- The level of physical addiction (Faguerström Test).\n- Reasons for quitting smoking.\n- Consumption habits.\n\nThis information is used as the basis for developing a timeline tailored to the real needs of each smoker. For the physiological aspects of addiction, relevant guidelines are given so that, alongside consultation with a healthcare professional, the user has access to treatment that is appropriate for their profile.\n\n* THE TIMELINE. DAILY TASKS\n\nFollowing an initial evaluation, the user can access the Treatment Programme, which, using the timeline adapted to their own consumption, leads them through a process that involves carrying out various daily tasks:\n\n- Daily challenge\n- Reflections and myths\n- Guess the answer\n- Daily recap\n\nThese tasks are aimed at modifying ideas about consumption itself as well as changing the habits that sustain it, such as controlling anxiety as a crucial symptom of abstinence and craving.\n\nThe initial objective is to gradually reduce consumption in order to then be able to quit completely and prevent relapses. From day one, the user has to record every cigarette that they smoke, and they have to adjust to daily consumption goals. You can record every cigarette that you smoke using the application’s cigarette log, using a Widget or even your Apple Watch.\n\n* RELAXATION AND CRISIS\n\nThe application contains a complete guide to relaxation that will teach you simple techniques to relax and control anxiety. The Crisis section is for when you don’t want to smoke but you have a strong craving, especially after D Day.\n\n* INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTHKIT\n\nWith the aim of showing and analysing your heartbeat on the application, Stop Tobacco may read this information from the HealthKit database on your iPhone and Apple Watch.\n\nFollow us on facebook: @stoptabacomobiletraining\n\n* University studies conducted by the ULPGC demonstrate the effectiveness of this program to stop smoking. Even so, this application does not guarantee that you will stop smoking."

It is important not to confuse it with the pregnancy calculator. In this case it is a test to know whether you are pregnant or not. Doing this test is an option to have a rough idea, but if you really want to know whether you are pregnant it is important to see your doctor or to go to the pharmacy to do a reliable test.\n- You will find various tips related to pregnancy week by week and early signs of pregnancy, which will be very helpful.\nWe hope that you find this app helpful and that you liked it.

When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head.

Staring at pregnancy tests day after day to the point where you might even be seeing an imaginary second line? Get a little more assurance with the Pregnancy Test Checker app! With our neat little tool, you can take or import a photo of your pregnancy test stick and apply photo effects to make that (hopefully visible) second line easier to see. Current effects include brighten, contrast, grayscale, invert, exposure, gamma, hue, saturation and sharpen and we are continuing to work on adding more features!\n\nWe also provide a community where you can share photos of your tests or other TTC-related photos that other users can vote and comment on. You can also do the same for others!\n\nWe realize how stressful and frustrating the process of becoming pregnant can be, especially for those of you that have tried so hard and yearn for that pregnancy test to finally be positive after months or even years of disappointment. As such, we added a baby dust feature that we hope will provide a little comfort and encouragement to you during your journey to become pregnant.\n\nShould you run into any issues, we would sincerely appreciate it if you could send feedback to us first in the app instead of leaving a negative review and we will work to address your issue as quickly as possible. Thank you!"

If you have doubts or if the line is not very clear, you can take a photo of your test and edit it by modifying the contrast, grayscale, contrast, brightness, gamma, saturation, etc. in order to see it more clearly.\n- Photo editing: You will be able to take a photo of your test once you take a physical test, edit it, retouch it, add effects, and then share it with your loved ones so they know that you are pregnant and expecting a baby.\n\nNote: This app has been created with the purpose of help and guidance, but it does not offer scientific results or reliable results. It is a quiz for obtaining a guiding result as an aid but is never definitive. It is important that you go to the doctor or pharmacy for a 100% reliable result."

In this case, the best idea is to go to a professional doctor or a pharmacy to do a pregnancy test, but if you want to have an approximate orientation before going, you can do the \"Am I pregnant quiz\" we have prepared.\n\nMain characteristics:\n- Before the first signs of pregnancy, if you want to know the approximate possibility to become pregnant, you can use this pregnancy test calculator to eliminate your doubts.\n- It is an online pregnancy test, focused on 15 questions about the signs of early pregnancy during the first weeks, which will give you a guiding result.\n- If you are tired of home pregnancy tests, you can try to take this questionnaire. You will have an approximate result by only responding to some simple questions related to the early pregnancy signs in first weeks of pregnancy.\n\nWhich kind of questions will you find in this home pregnancy test?\nAs we have explained before, all questions are focused on early pregnancy symptoms. Therefore, you will find some questions related to fatigue, irritability, sickness or vomiting, appetite, heartburn, constipation, etc. In short, a collection of the most relevant questions to be able to have an orientation about your situation.\nIf you ask yourself how to know whether you are pregnant, this app will help you to shed some light and have a rough idea. We hope that this free pregnancy test helps you in discovering a positive or negative pregnancy test result or whatever you are looking for.\nIf, on the contrary, you want to know how to get pregnant, this is not the aim of this app, therefore we recommend you to search for other apps or information of a professional doctor, since the aim of this app is to check your pregnancy status when having some sign of pregnancy to know whether you are pregnant or not.\n\nNote: This app is not a reliable pregnancy test, but simply a questionnaire to obtain an approximate result, but never definite. It is important that you go to the doctor or pharmacy for a 100% reliable result when experiencing signs of being pregnant.\n\nLegal note: This app and its content have been created by Smiko.

When it comes to fitness goals, different body measurements should be taken into account! Don’t fret, this best free calculator for BMI will works as a body measurement tracker to track different health parameters.  \r\nAn online bmi calculator by EclixTech is 100% free app that provides you with the precise body measurements. This tool is very useful for your weight loss and fitness plans. Well, let’s we further elaborate the health measurements that is used by our bmi tool.\r\nBody Measurements Used By This App:\r\nRead on!\r\nBody Mass Index (BMI):\r\nBMI is a measure of body size based on height and weight that applies to men, women, and child. Your BMI tells whether you’re fall in healthy, normal, overweight or obese category. So, simply add the values into the above calculator for bmi to learn what should my BMI be for my age? \r\nBasal Metabolic Rate (BMR):\r\nBMR is said to be as the total number of calories that your body needs to perform basic, life-sustaining functions. \r\nBMR is also said to as your body’s metabolism, thus, any increase to your metabolic weight, like exercise, will increase your BMR. So, simply try our basal metabolic rate calculator to calculate bmr, the number of calories that your body burn if you stayed in bed all day. \r\nBody Fat Percentage (BFP):\r\nThe BFP of an individual is said to be the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, and multiplied by 100, body fat consists of essential body fat & storage body fat. Remember that BFP is only body measurement that directly helps to find an individual’s relative body composition without regard to height or weight. Simply try the ideal body fat percentage calculator to know how much fat your body has!\r\nWaist to Height Ratio (WHR):\r\nThe WHR is said to be a measure of the fat distribution of body fat, simply it is considered to assess the fat content in human body. To track waist to height ratio, simply try our waist to height ratio calculator.\r\nTotal Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):\r\nTDEE is referred to as an estimation of how many calories you burn each day when exercise is taken into account. Try our tdee calculator that allows you to calculate tdee corresponding to the activity level. \r\nEstimated Energy Requirement (EER):\r\nEER is said to be as the average dietary intake that is predicted to maintain energy balance in healthy, normal weight individuals. So, simply calculate EER by using eer calculator to maintain your energy balance. \r\nFeatures of BMI Calculator:\r\n•\t100% free & accurate body tracker\r\n•\tBmi calculator allows you to manage your profile & edit your detail when needed\r\n•\tCalculate BMI, BMR, BFP, WHR, TDEE, and EER with this smart app\r\n•\tAllow to access six different body measurements at the main screen of this app\r\n•\tSave inputs for future & update them instantly\r\nStep-By-Step Calculations:\r\nCalculate BMI with bmi calculator app:\r\n•\tHit BMI tab\r\n•\tAdd body weight & height\r\nOutputs:\r\n•\tBMI gauge meter to shows in which bmi range your weight fall in\r\n•\tBMI chart including category and ranges\r\nCalculate BMR with bmr calculator:\r\nInputs:\r\n•\tHit BMR tab\r\n•\tAdd age, weight, and height\r\nOutputs:\r\n•\tCalories/Day corresponding to the given inputs\r\nCalculate BFP with body fat calculator:\r\nInputs:\r\n•\tHit BFP tab\r\n•\tAdd age, height, waist, & neck\r\nOutputs:\r\n•\tHorizontal BFP ranges bar\r\n•\tBody fat chart including category and ranges\r\nCalculate WHR with WHR calculator:\r\nInputs:\r\n•\tHit WHR tab\r\n•\tAdd age, height, & weight\r\nOutputs:\r\n•\tHorizontal ranges bar for WHR\r\n•\tWHR chart including category and ranges\r\nCalculate TDEE:\r\nInputs:\r\n•\tHit TDEE tab\r\n•\tAdd age, weight, height\r\n•\tSelect your activity level\r\nOutputs:\r\n•\tCalories/Day\r\nCalculate EER with estimated energy requirement calculator:\r\nInputs:\r\n•\tHit EER tab\r\n•\tAdd age, weight, height,\r\n•\tChoose the activity level\r\nOutputs:\r\n•\tCalories/Day"

      "label": "Would you like to lose weight quickly and effectively without sports and exhausting diets? Then, an intermittent fasting tracker is what you need!\n\nIntermittent fasting is a style of eating for weight loss. It is based on periodical refuse to eat. There are many plans for intermittent fasting. The most popular method is the 16:8 system - skipping food for 16 hours and 8 hours when you can eat. Eating this way makes your body burn fat efficiently.\n\nThe main advantage of fasting is that you don't have to give up your favorite food, it will be enough to skip breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Emotionally, this is much easier than, for example, fasting days on juices. In addition, there are no restrictions on products, which means that you can afford small weaknesses: desserts, fried food, bread, pastries.\n\nOur app is specifically designed to make your intermittent fasting as comfortable as possible. All you need to do is to fill in your details and choose the fasting plan that suits you best. The rest will be done by our application. It will send you a notification when to start fasting and when to indulge in food. The app will graph your weight loss and calculate your body mass index. Tracking your weight loss progress has never been easier.\n\nA simple and intuitive interface will make the process of your weight loss fun. Our widget will show you all the information you need about the current status right on your iPhone desktop.\n\nWhy is intermittent fasting so effective?\nA 16-hour refusal to eat optimizes insulin secretion, and this makes the body less sensitive to carbohydrates with a high glycemic index and reduces hunger. In moments of starvation, your body begins to burn fat reserves without being distracted by food processing. Moreover, an empty stomach can \"rest\", it boosts immunity. Some nutritionists are sure that this principle of nutrition reduces inflammatory processes in the body, regulates blood sugar levels, and improves mental function.\n\nFasting schedule (plans)\nGentle – 12:12 | 13:11 | 14:10\nModerate – 15:9 | 16:8 | 17:7\nIntense – 18:6 | 19:5 | 20:4\n\nIntegrate with the health app (HealthKit) to read and track your steps data and show them in a beautiful way.\n\n\nYou need to believe in yourself and move forward.\nEverything is achievable!"

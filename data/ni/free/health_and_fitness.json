      "label": "Dreaming of a flat belly, lean legs, and toned glutes? Get desired results in 30 days with Gravity Fit: choose workouts for your trouble zones or train your entire body using a ready-made program designed for your needs and parameters.\n\nWe guarantee you will achieve your goals, just like these other users:\n\n”I'd like to thank Gravity Fit for an excellent training program. You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

      "label": "Would you like to lose weight quickly and effectively without sports and exhausting diets? Then, an intermittent fasting tracker is what you need!\n\nIntermittent fasting is a style of eating for weight loss. It is based on periodical refuse to eat. There are many plans for intermittent fasting. The most popular method is the 16:8 system - skipping food for 16 hours and 8 hours when you can eat. Eating this way makes your body burn fat efficiently.\n\nThe main advantage of fasting is that you don't have to give up your favorite food, it will be enough to skip breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Emotionally, this is much easier than, for example, fasting days on juices. In addition, there are no restrictions on products, which means that you can afford small weaknesses: desserts, fried food, bread, pastries.\n\nOur app is specifically designed to make your intermittent fasting as comfortable as possible. All you need to do is to fill in your details and choose the fasting plan that suits you best. The rest will be done by our application. It will send you a notification when to start fasting and when to indulge in food. The app will graph your weight loss and calculate your body mass index. Tracking your weight loss progress has never been easier.\n\nA simple and intuitive interface will make the process of your weight loss fun. Our widget will show you all the information you need about the current status right on your iPhone desktop.\n\nWhy is intermittent fasting so effective?\nA 16-hour refusal to eat optimizes insulin secretion, and this makes the body less sensitive to carbohydrates with a high glycemic index and reduces hunger. In moments of starvation, your body begins to burn fat reserves without being distracted by food processing. Moreover, an empty stomach can \"rest\", it boosts immunity. Some nutritionists are sure that this principle of nutrition reduces inflammatory processes in the body, regulates blood sugar levels, and improves mental function.\n\nFasting schedule (plans)\nGentle – 12:12 | 13:11 | 14:10\nModerate – 15:9 | 16:8 | 17:7\nIntense – 18:6 | 19:5 | 20:4\n\nIntegrate with the health app (HealthKit) to read and track your steps data and show them in a beautiful way.\n\n\nYou need to believe in yourself and move forward.\nEverything is achievable!"

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps.

Staring at pregnancy tests day after day to the point where you might even be seeing an imaginary second line? Get a little more assurance with the Pregnancy Test Checker app! With our neat little tool, you can take or import a photo of your pregnancy test stick and apply photo effects to make that (hopefully visible) second line easier to see. Current effects include brighten, contrast, grayscale, invert, exposure, gamma, hue, saturation and sharpen and we are continuing to work on adding more features!\n\nWe also provide a community where you can share photos of your tests or other TTC-related photos that other users can vote and comment on. You can also do the same for others!\n\nWe realize how stressful and frustrating the process of becoming pregnant can be, especially for those of you that have tried so hard and yearn for that pregnancy test to finally be positive after months or even years of disappointment. As such, we added a baby dust feature that we hope will provide a little comfort and encouragement to you during your journey to become pregnant.\n\nShould you run into any issues, we would sincerely appreciate it if you could send feedback to us first in the app instead of leaving a negative review and we will work to address your issue as quickly as possible.

It’s the most natural and safe way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting. When you fast, you just take a break from eating, it takes some of the load off your liver.\n\nCAN I USE FASTING TRACKER?\n\nWith various fasting plans, fasting tracker is suitable for beginner and experienced, men and women.

Tijdens deze periode wordt u gevraagd dagelijks uw klachten een cijfer te geven. Aan de hand van het dagboek zal na deze 2 weken gekeken worden of u kunt deelnemen aan de studie.\n-\tDe onderzoeksperiode (de periode waarin u een behandeling krijgt).\n-\tDeze periode duurt 12 weken. Ook tijdens deze periode wordt u gevraagd dagelijks uw klachten een cijfer te geven. Daarnaast vragen we u tijdens deze periode dagelijks of u bijwerkingen heeft gehad, en wekelijks of u voldoende verlichting van uw klachten heeft gehad.\n-\tTijdens beide onderzoeksperiodes wordt u ten slotte gevraagd in de app aan te geven of u medicatie heeft gebruikt. Hiervoor is in het startscherm een apart icoontje aangegeven (genaamd “Medicijnlijst”). In deze lijst kunt u uw vaste medicatie aangeven. Eenmalig of sporadisch gebruik van medicatie kunt u voor de betreffende dag apart invullen.\nHet ingevulde dagboek zal uiteindelijk gebruikt worden om te onderzoeken of de behandeling werkt. Het is daarom erg belangrijk dat u probeert het dagboek iedere dag – naar waarheid – in te vullen. De vragen over uw klachten gaan iedere dag open om 19.00u. Daarnaast krijgt u een herinnering om 21.00u. Het is niet mogelijk om de vragen van de vorige dag in te vullen.\n\nEén keer per maand wordt u gevraagd aanvullende vragenlijsten in te vullen op de computer. Wanneer dit het geval is krijgt u na het invullen van het dagboek een melding in de app. De betreffende vragenlijsten ontvangt u dan spoedig via de mail.\n\nMet vragen kunt u altijd terecht bij een van de onderzoekers van het onderzoeksteam. De contactgegevens kunt u vinden onder het contact icoontje (het envelopje) rechtsboven in het startscherm."

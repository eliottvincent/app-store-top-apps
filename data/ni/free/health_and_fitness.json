      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier. Install the Dr. Kegel app to amaze your partner, stay confident & be happy. Install now & you won’t regret it!\r\n\r\nWe offer a wide range of subscription options.

Benefit from the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method, trusted by hundreds of millions adopters worldwide!\n\nPerfect for establishing a basic eating discipline, Simple is ideal for keeping yourself in good shape during self-isolation, with our educational and motivational content on staying mindful about your eating habits.\n\nPopularized by celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé, intermittent fasting is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans. It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed.

      "label": "Punkt makes journaling secure, private, easy and fun. But the best of starting a journal now is that you become a happier person.\n\nHere's what makes Punkt special:\n\n* EASY TO USE *\nPunkt's focus is on a simple design. Your stories are the most important part of the app, so why should we distract you with any other complicated stuff?\n\n* SECURE AND PRIVATE *\nPunkt saves your stories on your local device and in your private iCloud. No one but you can read your stories. You can also protect your stories with Face ID or Touch ID.\n\n* NO LOGIN, NO ADS *\nPunkt works without sharing any personally identifiable information. The app is focused on simplicity and privacy. There is no login, no Facebook or Google SDKs, no analytics tracking, no server connection. Everything you do in Punkt is truly private and secure.\n\n* ACCESSIBILITY *\nPunkt supports dynamic type, voice-over and voice control. It is designed to be used by everyone. I would welcome any feedback regarding accessibility as this is truly important to me.\n\n* FAIR PRICING *\nPunkt is developed just by one developer, therefore I want to make really fair and transparent pricing. If Punkt makes you just a little bit happier, you can help to contribute that the app stays independent and does not need to display ads or require personal data.\n\n---------------\n\nWhy did I start building this app? I'm a startup founder myself and I've been through very rough but also hyper exciting and happy times. That's tough by itself, but if one of your loved ones is helpless in pain and suffers then your world stops spinning. Bad times in business and private life made me think about how I can get out of this and become more positive and happier in the end. I've researched a lot and came across the one-sentence journaling technique. Long story short, I've started tracking my days in a Google Sheet. With just a few clicks I could make myself smile again by reading stories about happy days. But also the other way round, looking at rough times makes you appreciate even more what you have in your life. Now I want to help other people with this app.\n\nIf you have any feedback you can reach out at https://punktapp.me or gregor@punktapp.me\n\n\n============\n\nShould you choose to support the development of this app and unlock all premium features of Punkt, payments will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n\nYour subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period and cancellation of the current active subscription period is not allowed.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off in your Account Settings in iTunes after purchase.\n\nYou can read our privacy policy at https://punktapp.me/privacy-policy\nYou can read our terms of use at https://punktapp.me/terms\n\n\nApp Preview Music: www.bensound.com"

Record or import audio, or use a sample from Medly’s vast audio library. You can record audio up to 4 bars or become a Member and record and import audio up to 30 seconds. As a Member, bring your songs to the next level with professionally recorded vocals by Medly’s talented artists.\n\nPOINT PERFECT AUTOMATION\nAutomatically change volume, echo, and other effects to add fades and pitch bends to your sounds. Snap between points and beats to achieve point perfect precision and use the selection tool to edit multiple automation points together. Then open the effect picker to quickly see the automation graphs of all effects within a Section.\n\nSHARE AND PLAY\nQuickly upload your songs to SoundCloud, or share it as a video, audio, MIDI, or Medly file. You can also connect Medly to other apps using Inter-App Audio or play in time using Ableton Link.\n\nMADE IN CANADA\nWe’re a small team working relentlessly to make Medly possible.

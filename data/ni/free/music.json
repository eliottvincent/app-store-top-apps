      "label": "Hello, this is Erik the programmer of YouDJ. I am an audio engineer, programming YouDJ for 10 years as a passion project. I don't have any cost that's why all features in this app are unlocked with no subscription or ads!! It is the most honest DJ app on the store for sure. Enjoy! :)\n\nMy mission is to create the most FUN and EASY dj mixer, so even my mother can be a DJ!\n\nTherefore, YouDJ is NOT the most complete DJ app but offers the MUST-HAVE DJ TOOLS. You will see that all the tools are pretty high quality! That's because I am an expert in this field (being an audio engineer). I built advanced technologies to allow everyone to mix like a pro and have fun doing it. It is still usable by advanced DJs but if you need more tools (MIDI controllers...), use a pro DJ app.\n\nIncluded DJ tools : 2 virtual turntables, 16 sound effects such echo/flanger/crusher, sampler with 80 built-in samples, realistic vinyl scratching, auto beat synchronization, keylock, seamless loops, playlist automix, hotcues, 3 bands equalizer, crossfader, low/high pass filter, music visualization (party mode)...\n\nTo finish, you don't need to have music on your device, the app is preloaded with great music from talented artists I personally know. Please support the artists by following them on social medias. You can also play MP3 files stored on your device.\n\nImportant : No DJ app (including YouDJ) will work with Apple Music / Spotify / Youtube Music because these are closed platforms and all their songs are encrypted with DRM. Also there is no legal way to mix popular music without paying on mobile, so don't ask me why there is no Justin Bieber in the provided songs!! ;)\n\nYouDJ is available on all desktop and mobile platforms. You should definitely try at least the computer version too (you.dj).\n\nHoping you will love the app and be prepared to waste lot of time ;)\n\nIf you want to thank me for all my time I put in this app, you can give me a good review, it helps me a lot, thanks!\n\n----------\n\nHOW TO MIX\n\nWhat you got is a traditional DJ setup : 2 turntables and a mixer. Your mission is to play simultaneously two songs on each turntable and to use the mixer to mix them together.\n\nTo spice up your mix, you can use effects such as the loops, the fx pads, the eq, the scratch, the sampler, the hot cues...\n\n----------\n\nAgain, BIG THANKS TO YOU for loving YouDJ, it motivates me to continue the project,\n\nHave fun with YouDJ and take care :)\n\nErik the programmer"

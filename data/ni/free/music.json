      "label": "SingTrue can teach anybody to sing in perfect tune. Even if you think you're tone deaf!\n~~ Selected by Apple for iTunes \"Learn an Instrument\" feature. ~~\n\n\"Easy to use.\" -- The New York Times\n\n\"A perfect app\" -- Appolicious.com\n\n\"Amazing, effective and user friendly\" -- AppPicker.com\n\n\"Voice training just got a whole lot easier and less expensive\" -- PreApps.com\n\nWorried that you have a bad voice? Always told you're out of tune or off-key when you sing?\n\nMany people think they can't sing because they don't have \"natural talent\" or weren't born \"musically gifted\". The surprising truth is that anybody can learn to sing well, even those who feel totally unmusical.\n\nSingTrue helps you discover your inner musicality and gain control over your voice to become a natural, confident, powerful singer.\n\n\nApp Store Reviews:\n\n\"Everything I wanted in an app I found on this one! It's easy to use and the exercises are great, I can already feel difference in my singing voice\"\n-- 5 stars, Courteney S, USA\n\n\"Definitely recommend this to anyone who worries at karaoke time!\"\n-- 5 stars \"Always-thinking\", UK\n\n\nHOW SINGTRUE WORKS\n\nSingTrue features over 30 interactive exercises* that help you learn to sing easily, confidently and in perfect tune. By using the iPhone microphone and sophisticated signal processing, the app analyses your singing and provides personal feedback on how you can improve.\n\nSpend a few minutes practicing with the app's exercises every day and you will rapidly become a capable, confident singer.\n\nIf you are already a musician, the app will train your voice and your ears to help you become more confident, more creative, and more musical. In fact, the advanced exercises will help you recognise notes by ear - enabling you to play by ear, write your own music, and improvise freely on your instrument.\n\nThe exercises have been designed by experts, in consultation with some of the leading vocal teachers in the world. Building on the success of the RelativePitch ear training app (featured by Apple and used by over 300,000 musicians) and the Tone Deaf Test (4.5-star rated app used by 170,000+ people), SingTrue has been developed to help more people discover their inner voice and naturally become sensational musicians.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- SingTrue develops your Voice, Ears and Mind for singing\n- Uses the iPhone microphone to analyse your singing and gives personal feedback\n- Over 30 different exercises to explore, with more coming soon*\n- Listening examples provided by professional singers\n- Track your progress in detail and see your voice improving\n- Share your achievements with friends on Facebook, Twitter or Email\n\n\nCOMMON QUESTIONS\n\nQ: What if I'm tone deaf?\nA: Don't worry! You probably aren't. Close to 1 million people have taken our Tone Deaf Test, and just 2% have proved to be genuinely tone deaf. Still worried? Search the App Store for our \"Tone Deaf Test\" app.\n\nQ: Is this just for people who like singing?\nA: No, SingTrue has been designed for singers and non-singers alike.\n\nQ: Can you really learn to sing in tune?\nA: Yes, it's simply a matter of learning pitch sensitivity (ears) and vocal control (voice).\n\nQ: What if I can already sing?\nA: SingTrue can help you become more accurate, more expressive and more confident.\n\n\nApp Store Reviews:\n\n\"This app is great way to learn to sing and to prove to my husband that I'm not tone deaf!\"\n-- 5 stars, Bardils, UK\n\n\"This app is incredibly useful both to the beginner and to the pro singer. Bravo!\"\n-- 5 stars, Richard E, UK\n\n\"I'm not a good singer by any means but with this app I think I finally have a chance to learn. It's been a few hours and I already can notice an improvement. Can't wait to see where I'll get when I have completed all levels.\"\n-- 5 stars, Peter, UK\n\nDownload SingTrue today!\n\nIf you have any other questions or need help getting started, just email support@EasyEarTraining.com and we'll be happy to help.\n\n* Unlocking the full set of exercises requires in-app purchase."

      "label": "With over 10 years in the App Store, Notion Mobile is a free, award-winning music composition tool for iOS, iPadOS®, macOS and more! You’ll effortlessly create dynamic compositions in traditional musical notation or guitar tablature with its intuitive touch-based interface and incredibly broad editing capabilities. \n \nWith a user-friendly interface and simple interactive piano keyboard, fretboard, drum pad, and even optional Handwriting Recognition, Notion Mobile makes it easy to get started composing your music. You can also hear your music performed with the most realistic playback possible, using real audio samples recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.\n\nNotion Mobile is a native cross-platform app, meaning you can write anywhere on any device without requiring a constant Internet connection. And when you’re back online, you’ll be able to sync your work across multiple devices — either through your preferred cloud provider, or through the optional wireless transfer between PreSonus applications on any device. Start your work on one device and finish it on another. Once you are happy with your creation you can share the Notion file, or export as MIDI, MusicXML, PDF or as an audio file.\n\nCompose, edit, and play back your music performed with real piano and orchestral samples recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios — along with outstanding sampled guitar, bass, drums and other popular instruments. And when you’re ready for more sounds, you’ll find the extensive library of Notion Add-on Soundsets to purchase as part of the Feature Bundle. To save space, the initial app download contains just piano — you can then manage which of the bundled Soundsets to have on your device or keep in the cloud, just tap on Sound Installation. \n\nNotion has been featured in various Apple campaigns including the 2014 YourVerse television commercials and has won several awards, including a prestigious music industry NAMM TEC Award for Best Smartphone/Tablet App.\n \nWhat you get:\n\nNotion Mobile includes unlimited staves, comprehensive editing features and core orchestral and rhythm section Soundsets — all for free. You can optionally register (also for free!) to unlock an additional Soundset (containing Solo Strings, Classical Saxophones and Glockenspiel), the multivoice function that allows writing in up to 4 voices per staff, and access to the friendly Notion Mobile User Forum. Then for the full experience, either sign in with your PreSonus Sphere membership or purchase the Notion Feature Bundle. This unlocks Handwriting Recognition, all the Expansion Soundsets (including many auxiliary instruments and additional articulations and effects), additional audio export formats (m4a, OPUS, FLAC) and direct file transfer between any PreSonus application running on the same network (including Notion Mobile, Notion Desktop, and Studio One.)\n\nFree:\nUnlimited staves\nAll editing features\nCore Soundsets\nExport as MIDI, PDF, wav, mp3\n\nRegister for free:\nReward Soundset including Solo Strings, Glockenspiel, Classical Saxophones \nAccess to the new Notion Mobile User Forum\nAdditionally write for voices 3 and 4 in a single staff\nExport as MusicXML, Compressed MusicXML\n\nFeature Bundle (in-app purchase or sign in with PreSonus Sphere):\nHandwriting Recognition, powered by MyScript\nAvailable on iPhone, iPad and macOS (macOS with supporting graphics tablet or using Sidecar with compatible iPad)\nAutomatic pen vs. finger recognition to switch between handwriting and edit mode\nPressure-sensitive support for Apple Pencil\nAdjustable timer for Handwriting Recognition\nOverride handwriting timer by double tapping Apple Pencil (2nd Gen)\nAll Expansion Soundsets\nAdditional audio export formats (m4a, OPUS, FLAC)\nDirect file transfer between any PreSonus application running on the same network (including Notion Mobile, Notion Desktop, and Studio One)"

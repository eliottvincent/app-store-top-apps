Start playing along to your favorite songs immediately.\n\nThe best drum app in the App Store just got better. Here's the long awaited sequel to Drum Kit. It's the closest thing to becoming a drummer without actually having a real kit. You can just tap to create your own beats, or you can play along to dozens of popular songs. It's super easy to use.\n\nThe kit is a classic 4-piece kit with bass drum, snare, floor tom, hi-hat, crash cymbal, and ride cymbal. The hi-hat plays open, closed, and pedal sounds depending on where you tap. The drums animate and the bass drum pedal moves when touched. Drum Kit simulates the most realistic drum playing experience on the App Store.\n\nDrum Kit is designed to be as responsive as possible and uses professionally recorded, high quality sounds. It is completely multi-touch and has very low latency. Use it to crank out some beats on the train or play a fill after a punchline. The photorealistic drums and animations make it feel like you're playing a real kit. \n\nFeatures:\n- customize your kit by moving drums around\n- play along to the MIDI version of many popular songs\n- record up to 1 minute of video\n- save video to the camera roll\n- share video\n- save and play back songs\n\nPlug into headphones or speakers for a much richer sound experience."

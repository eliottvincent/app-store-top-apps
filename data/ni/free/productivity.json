You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.

We automatically organize all the things life throws at you, like receipts and attachments, so you can find what you need fast. Plus, we've got your back with other convenient features like one-tap unsubscribe, free trial expiration alerts and package tracking. \n\nFavorite features:\n\n• One-tap unsubscribe from pushy promos\nSkip the tiny unsubscribe links at the end of long emails. We organize all your mailing lists in one spot, so it’s easy to unsubscribe from noisy newsletters and promos with a quick tap. \n\n• Organize and navigate your inbox with ease\nFind what you need fast with inbox filters that sort your emails by attachments, starred, unread, and more. Stay organized and clear out the junk by deleting or moving up to 10,000 emails at once from a particular sender or category. \n\n• Quickly spot receipts & package delivery updates\nSee all your receipts organized in one place so you can easily find the one you're looking for. Plus, see the status of all your upcoming deliveries at a glance. Top-of-inbox package tracking alerts means you'll never miss a delivery. \n\n• Pull up the best deals from your inbox\nNo more searching through countless promotional emails to find those savings. This view organizes your inbox around your favorite stores and the categories you shop. Now, find all your favorite deals—without the clutter.\n\n• Keep tabs on your free trials\nGet reminders before free trials expire—so you can update your subscription plan or cancel before the subscription trial ends. \n\n• Customize your notifications\nChoose which notifications you really need and say bye-bye to the ones you don't. You can turn on alerts for emails from people, bills & receipts, deals, travel, reminders or general messages. \n\n• Connect your other accounts\nBring your Gmail, AOL, or Microsoft accounts and take advantage of extra features. Set your own swipe actions, change up the sounds or swap in your favorite color. (We like purple)\n\n• Accessibility\nMaking sure our products are accessible is a priority. Yahoo Mail has high contrast themes, dynamic text resizing and VoiceOver screen reader compatibility. Plus, folders at the bottom of the inbox allow assistive technology users to navigate with less effort.\n\n• 1,000GB free storage\nThat's 985 more than some other inboxes, just sayin. ;) Download the app and enjoy a more spacious inbox.\n\n• Yahoo Mail Plus \nGet ad-free mail, extra organization and privacy features, plus 24/7 tech support across your iOS mobile devices.\n\n+        Available as an in-app purchase at $1.99/month charged to your iTunes account\n+        Subscription will auto-renew each month within 24 hours of your renewal date\n+        Manage or cancel your subscription via Account Settings\n\nTerms of service: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/index.html\nPrivacy policy: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.html\n\nHow are we doing?

You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox.

No one else will be able to receive or read this data either during its transmission or in the storage.\r\n\r\nWe are not responsible for the loss of your data in the event of a device flashing, using jailbreak and similar systems, as well as when restoring a device from a backup without the keychain synchronization option enabled with iCloud.\r\n\r\nWe guarantee that your personal data is not sent to the network, is not stored or processed on our servers; therefore, we provide the ability to use your personal cloud storage for synchronization, thereby eliminating the possibility of access to your data by third parties, while maintaining privacy, simplicity use and the ability to quickly recover. To ensure the safety of your data, we strongly recommend that you always use synchronization with your cloud storage.\r\n\r\nImportant: when a PIN code or master password is lost, its recovery is impossible, and data recovery is impossible (this is due both to the security policy of our application and the limited capabilities of encryption algorithms).\r\n\r\nOur advantages:\r\n\r\n• Do not collect your personal data: just download and use it without registration.\r\n• Do not need the internet to work with Secure. Data is always with you: abroad, in the forest or on a plane.\r\n• Protect your data from prying people: access via Face ID, Touch ID and/or PIN code.\r\n• Start to protect your data as soon as you add your first password.\r\n• Use your data on multiple devices by connecting your Dropbox, Google Drive or iCloud Drive. We do not have access to your data, and we cannot see it.\r\n• Autofill your passwords quickly and save you time. (Available on iOS 12)\r\n• Generate strong and unique passwords with our Password Generator.\r\n• Share your passwords as the text message anywhere you need.\r\n• Additional security: Erase Data, Emergency PIN Code and Facedown Lock!\r\n\r\nThe app contains the following subscription options (Premium access for data backup, cloud synch and no limits for passwords and additional security functions):\r\n- Monthly and annual subscriptions;\r\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase;\r\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable;\r\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period;\r\n- The account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal;\r\n- Subscriptions might be managed by the user and auto-renewal might be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase;\r\n- Price may vary depending on the currency and region.\r\n\r\nPrivacy policy: https://doc.texode.com/spass/en/privacy\r\nTerms of use: https://doc.texode.com/spass/en/term-of-use"

Pomodoro Focus Timer has a minimal design to keep distractions away. It is an effective tool to retain motivation and focus.\n\nThis app uses the Original Pomodoro Technique which is proven to keep you focusing on your work. Break up what seems like impossible tasks into short chunks and be surprised at how much you can get done.\n\nDecide what the task you want to work on is (ex. studying, writing, reading, note-taking, drawing, etc.). Focus sessions are pre-set to 25 minutes, simply press the play button to begin the timer. Roll up your sleeves and get to work, focus on your chosen task until the timer rings. The break sessions, which are pre-set to 5 minutes, will begin. Take the time to walk away from you work, and give your brain a chance to relax until the timer signals that it’s time to get back to work. Your amount of focus sessions completed are being tracked. Once you have completed 4, you deserve a longer break. Your pre-set Long Break session will begin to countdown, when the timer rings the cycle starts all over again.\n\nPremium users now have the ability customize their sessions and set reminders so they can keep the motivation going for those tasks and projects that may take a couple sessions to accomplish."

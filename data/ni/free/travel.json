      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 645 cities in 45 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

      "label": "Quantum random exploration can change reality as you know it. The superpower behind Randonautica gives you a random location to journey to. Set your intention in your mind for what you seek, you will find. \n\nReasons to use Randonautica to generate completely random coordinates for you to travel to:\r\n\r\n\n-To go on an unexpected adventure\r\n-To test out quantum entropy and the mind's ability to influence reality\r\n-To break the matrix\r\n-To get some exercise by walking to a random location\r\n-To open a real world portal\r\n-To get off screens and go on an outdoor adventure\r\n-To feel heightened awareness and observation\r\n-To feel being present \r\n-To find new areas in your neighborhood, town or city\n\r\n-To connect with other people of similar interests across the globe on Randonautica's in-app Social Media feed, Discover\n\n\n\r\nProven:\r\n\r\n\nGoing to a random location makes you hyperaware and present, often providing a sense of meditation or the feeling of being alive again. Random exploration adds novelty to life!\r\n\r\n\nTheoretical: \n\n\r\n\r\nBy interfacing with quantum entropy there is growing evidence that the mind, thoughts, emotions and words have an impact on matter. Using Randonautica creates a bridge to access a very malleable reality. Having an intense thought or \"intention\" while the generation process is happening can result in an effect in the real world as you journey to the random coordinates provided by the app. People have reported that there is a ripple effect where their intention has lasting effect on their personal reality and observation.-To defeat feeling \"stuck\" in the day-to-day \n\nRandonautica is the first ever quantumly generated adventure game that takes you on a journey of true randomness. The adventure is yours to have and the legend will be yours to tell. Welcome, future Randonauts!\n\nThe app uses both pseudo and quantum entropy sources for randomization which provides a set of coordinates that can be opened in a map to navigate to or the user can digitally explore the coordinates. While “Blind Spots” are random points meant to be visited for exploring the unknown world around you, choosing an “Anomaly” type coordinate will run an algorithm over your radius to find the most statistically improbable distribution of random points within your radius. These are destinations where the real magic happens.\n\nExplore the world beyond the habitual and deterministic patterns of your everyday life, discover adventures right in front of your doorstep. \n\nSubscriptions:\n• Pro Subscription allows you to unlock unlimited points, setting custom location by long pressing anywhere on the map, and the new Pro Theme\n• Payment will be charged to your credit/debit card at the confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nPrivacy, Terms and Conditions:\nhttps://www.randonautica.com/terms-and-services"

With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device.

And you can buy cheap air tickets. How do you like the idea?\n- You can subscribe to notifications about the cheapest air ticket, the most convenient one or the most direct flight (yes, this is possible as well). This way you can keep track of changes in the cost of plane tickets. As soon as the price changes, we will send you a notification.\n- But these are not all of the subscriptions! You can also subscribe to the search for air tickets from your city and catch cheap tickets for a plane that flies in the most unexpected direction. What a surprise!\n- We also have a \"Price Schedule\" - it helps you buy a cheap ticket if you are not tied to the departure date.\n- And the \"Price Map\" - in case you have not yet decided on your destination. The map shows both domestic and international flights.\n- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.\n- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.\n- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).\n- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.\n- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.\n\nBy the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:\n\n- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.\n- Guided and self-guided tours.\n- Cars and transfers to get from the airport to the hotel. And wherever else you want to go\n\nDownload the WayAway app now to start traveling and buy tickets.\n\n*** The application from WayAway.com allows you to find the lowest possible cost of an air ticket.

The app has been an invaluable tool, allowing us to experience spots our friends have raved about and share our own favorites as well.

A must have travel app for sure!\"  \n~ Sarah and Hani, www.adventuresinskyhorse.com\n\n\"An overlander must have for Central and South America, you know all those blogs you have been taking notes from to find the good camp spots?

Whether you are looking for paid with services or off the grid this app has you covered... And as it is open source you can add to the adventure.\"\n~ Toby & Chloe, www.facebook.com/CarpeViam.net\n\n\"Great App if you are traveling the Panamericana with your camper.

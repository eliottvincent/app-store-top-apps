      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 700 cities in 47 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

      "label": "Buy one of our prepaid eSIM plans at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) in over 190+ countries and regions to enjoy global connectivity!\nAdd a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and stop worrying about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries.

With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

      "label": "Stay connected while you travel with affordable, prepaid eSIM data (available for 120+ countries). \n\nChoose a data plan and install it instantly on your device. No need for SIM card swapping or in-store visits! \n\nEven in this world of free Wi-Fi connections, sometimes you just need a solid data connection. aloSIM is perfect for travel, work, or pay-as-you-go data freedom.\n\n1. Browse data plans in 120+ countries\n2. Choose the data package that's right for you\n3. Install it right away on your device\n4. Use your eSIM data to avoid roaming fees\n5. Need more data? It's easy to top up your plan!\n\nWHY USE ALOSIM?\n\nEASY TO USE: Most newer devices were already designed for eSIM technology, so it’s easy to activate! \nAFFORDABLE: Never pay roaming charges again. With aloSIM, you get access to local data in 120+ countries.\nFLEXIBLE: Need more data? It’s easy to top up your eSIM right on your device.\nPREPAID: Buy only what you need. No need to worry about hidden fees or recurring charges.\n\nWHAT’S AN ESIM? \n\nAn eSIM is a software-based version of a traditional SIM card, letting your device connect to different networks for a data connection.\n\nThere are three main reasons people purchase eSIM data plans:\n \n1. Affordable local travel data: They’re traveling outside of their usual coverage zone, and they want to be able to connect to a local network so they can avoid roaming charges.\n \n2. Short-term data for devices that don’t normally have data: An eSIM data plan allows you to put temporary data on a device that might not normally have a network connection, like an iPad or an older phone you no longer use.\n \n3. Prepaid data for people who don’t want a monthly data plan: Not everyone wants to pay for a monthly cell phone plan. People sometimes prefer a prepaid model, where they can buy data as they need it, without being tied down with monthly contracts and commitments.\n\nHOW DOES ALOSIM PREVENT ROAMING CHARGES?\n\nWhen you mobile leave your carrier's coverage area, they'll charge you to \"roam\" and you'll pay for the privilege of staying connected in a new place. It can be very expensive! But aloSIM customers avoid roaming charges by switching off their primary data plan and using an eSIM plan instead. They decide how much eSIM data they want to buy, and they use it any way they’d like – never paying roaming charges.\n\nHOW MUCH eSIM TRAVEL DATA DO I NEED?\n\nIt depends on how connected you’d like to be on your trip, and the quality of the local Wi-Fi. Some aloSIM customers just buy a couple of gigs of eSIM data and see how it goes. If they need more, they can easily top up their eSIM.\n\nHOW DO I KNOW IF MY PHONE HAS ESIM?\n\nMany newer-model phones are automatically equipped with eSIM technology and ready to use eSIM data plans. There’s a complete list of eSIM-compatible devices on alosim.com.\n\nWHAT TYPES OF DATA PLANS DOES ALOSIM OFFER?\n\nHere at aloSIM, we believe mobile data should be flexible and customizable.\n\n1. Shop local eSIMs or regional eSIMs\n2. Select the data package that suits your needs\n3. Activate your new mobile data package from aloSIM and start using your new data\n\nDEVICES THAT SUPPORT eSIM:\niPhone XR\niPhone XS\niPhone XS Max\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone SE 2 (2020)\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 Mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 Mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone SE 3 (2022) \niPad Air (4th generation)\niPad Air (3rd Generation)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (4th generation)\niPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (2nd generation)\niPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation)\niPad (8th generation)\niPad (7th generation)\niPad Mini (5th Generation)\n\nSo whether you’re looking for eSIM data for travel, work, or home, aloSIM is here to provide the data you need + the flexibility you want.\n\nLearn more at alosim.com, and reach out anytime by emailing support@alosim.com."

You can re-create up to seven daily routines per week and create different routines for every saved location. This lets you check out how your dad’s sailing weekend looks, while you trek over the mountains.\n \nWith a library of hundred icons, you’ll be able to include activities for any part of your routine, from returning to your home, grabbing a bite from your favorite food truck, or for your daily commute, even if it's by helicopter.\n \nA Weather Way also shows you an intuitive seven-day forecast representation. If by the end of the week that cool blue is turning grey, you’ll know it’s time to get your coat out of the closet. If that warm yellow is fading into red, then you can expect a hot day on the beach over your long weekend."

It also displays the current temperature and humidity.\n• Display barometric pressure (sensor value) or mean sea level pressure (MSLP - value used in weather forecast services or stations).\n• Units support for pressure: mb, inHg, kPa, atm, Torr, psi, hPa, mmHg. Units for altitude: meter, feet.\n• Calibrate the barometer using altitude/location from the GPS. Calibrate the altimeter using the nearest airport information/METAR, or manually enter the QNH of the nearest airport. Offset sensor output value.\n• Measure the height (building/mountain/hiked/climbed) using the \"Relative Altitude\" feature (can be enabled in the app's Settings).\n• Notification about pressure change. \"Notification custom rule\" for you to define how and when the app sends notifications.\nNotify when air pressure changes indicate that extreme or worse weather may occur.\n• \"Pressure Tracking\" and \"History Graph\" require \"Background App Refresh\" or \"Always Location Service\" with \"Exact update interval\" (paid feature) enabled.\n• \"My Area\" allows you to define your frequent stay places, and the app tracks air pressure with location data.\n• Export history to CSV format and Today widget (paid features).\n• This app is the digital version compared with an aneroid or mercury barometer and can be adjusted to MSLP with additional features.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE:\nYou can change your barometer/altimeter appearance with:\n• Seven different housing colors.\n• Black, white or blue disk background.\n• Four different app backgrounds.\n• Three different types of needles.\n• Marker needle for easily monitor.\n• Dark or light Today widget theme.\n\nNOTES:\n• App only works on devices with a barometer sensor, such as iPhone 6/6s/7/8/X/11/12/13 (including Plus models), iPad Mini 4/Air 2/Pro, or later.\n• Weather icons on the dial: This only shows the air pressure trend like in an analog barometer.\n• Each time your device reboots, open the app for tracking with the \"Exact update interval\" feature work.\n• You may take the phone/tablet far away from computers, cables, and other magnetic sources to get accurate results.\n\nIf you like this app, please support us - you can remove ads or unlock paid features from the menu: Shop.\nWe welcome your ideas and suggestions - please email us at: support+barometer@pvdapps.com.\nFollow our official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/barometerplus/ or Twitter account: https://twitter.com/pvdapps."

This important event will cause disasters such as accidents on all types of transportation, massive lack of food and water, for months or even years, and overloads in electrical networks that will render useless the appliances of millions of homes, causing massive fires in homes and buildings, where the lives of thousands of people will be at risk if they are not alerted in time.\n\nIn a brief, simple and clear fashion, but also with plenty of technical data if required, Solar Alert warns you of possible obstacles presented that you and your whole family may have when dangerous solar storms occur; events that NASA scientists have already warned will undoubtedly occur in the coming years.\n\nWith the help and information provided by this application, you will have the following advantages:\n\n√  You will be able to take necessary precautions to reduce risks associated with defects in the functioning of telecommunications and all type of vehicles because there is a high risk of general failure of their electrical systems, especially aerial control systems and propulsion of aircraft in flight in the case of an extreme solar event.\n\n√ You will be able to disconnect and electromagnetically isolate your appliances in time to protect them from devastating power surges, especially to prevent fires in your home.\n\n√ You will be able to avoid severe obstacles posed by the failure of electromechanical systems such as trains and elevators in buildings when assistance with freeing you can take days to arrive.\n\n√ You will be able to be alert and prepared for possible earthquakes caused by intense solar activity since there is a statistically demonstrated relationship between the two phenomena.\n\n√ You will be able to move away from nuclear installations in time because the safety of nuclear reactors can be severely compromised.\n\nMain features of Solar Alert:\n\n• An automatic early warning system that analyzes the data supplied by the agencies NOAA and NASA, calculates the alerts with accurate time, and displays the recommendations in a summarized way, allowing you to act with an advanced warning of up to 3 days to be able to protect your life and your entire family.\n\n• A visual timer that provides a countdown of time remaining until the arrival of the solar storm.\n\n• Easy and comfortable access to graphics and images of the Sun, supplied by the observatories of the space agencies NASA and ESA, as well as NOAA, all updated every few minutes.\n\n• Menu with the list of preparations and precautions to take before the arrival of a severe solar storm. Information based on the recommendations of the agencies FEMA, ICDO, and NASA.\n\n************\nNow, with Solar Alert, you can be prepared and warned up to 3 days in advance, in front of the solar storms that will undoubtedly block our entire technology-dependent society.\n************\n\nSolar Alert is a protection service offered through an auto-renewable subscription and is destined to save your life from the expected Perfect Solar Storm. The payment of this vital alert service will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase and is renewed at the end of each subscription period.

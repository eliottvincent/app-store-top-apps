This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

From sunup to sundown, Toca Life: Farm is fun on the farm!\n\nEXPLORE LIFE ON THE FARM\nThe four locations in Toca Life: Farm will give you everything you need to tell your farm stories. Tend to the animals in the barn — feed them and clean up their poop! Once you've taken care of the animals, head to the house, where you can have a meal then grab your banjo for an impromptu jam session.

Harvest your produce and head to the store, where you can sell your food, make new products and buy goods!\n\nTURN YOUR HARVEST INTO FOOD\nPlant your seeds and find out how to make them grow! Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

      "label": "Currently featured in Apple's \"Everything changes with iPad\" campaign showing how much learning has changed with this very powerful tool!\n\nMontessori Letter Sounds is a multi award-winning app to get your children on the road to reading!\n\nIt works in 4 easy steps:\n- From the age of 3: “I spy” to play sound games.\n- Around 4 years old: “Letter sounds” to memorize the letter sounds and shape.\n- Between 4 and 5: “Mix and match” to bring together the two first steps.\n- Around 4 1/2 years old: “Sound it out” to write their first words using a moveable alphabet.\n\nAll four steps are included in this version but two games are locked at first and get unlocked as the children play and win marbles.  This ensures progressive learning.\n\nThe settings offer:\n- Script, Cursive or Capital letters\n- *Our unique \"foreign language\" option, which enables children to play with the letter sounds in one of the four languages while listening to the instructions in their native language.\n\nChildren also benefit from a “Toolbox” offering:\n- A phonetic alphabet \n- A notebook\n- A sandbox to trace letters freely \n- An image box (great for vocabulary)\n\nThis version includes English, Spanish, French, German and Italian with a unique \"foreign language\" option to start learning another language!\n\nIn each step, children will find a learning activity and a game to help them put their learning into practice.  Self-correction is encouraged throughout the app to increase self-confidence.   The system keeps track of marbles won by each player.  Marbles are used to unlock games and levels and to stimulate learning.\n\nParents Choice Gold Medal 2012\nCommon Sense On for Learning Award\nFeatured by Apple\n\nAbout EDOKI\n\nWe founded EDOKI (launched as “Les Trois Elles Interactive” in 2010) to bring our classroom experience with hundreds of children to the Digital world of tablets.

      "label": "Are you in search of an innovative way to sharpen your child’s reasoning skills and awaken their intelligence?  Then you’ll love Busy Shapes designed for children from 2 years old!\n\n*** Featured in App Store Best of 2014 ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n*** Featured in the USA Today ***\n*** Recommended by The Good App Guide ***\n*** Common Sense Media Editors' Pick 2014 ***\n*** Parents‘ Choice Awards 2014 ***\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2014 ***\n\n> Inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980)\n> Helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of engaging puzzles\n> Real-time dashboard to monitor progress\n> Includes an array of kid-friendly features, such as “passing” swipe control & more!\n\nABOUT BUSY SHAPES\nBusy Shapes helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of puzzles, in which they must change simple shapes and place them in proper holes. Along the way, the app responds to each child’s actions with positive guidance and motivation. Plus, the app’s digital exploratory playground regularly refreshes with different objects, which keeps children interested and engaged.\n\nINSPIRED BY JEAN PIAGET\nBusy Shapes is inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980), who believed that “children are little scientists”, and that a child's thoughts are built through experiences that encourage him or her to engage in the reasoning process.\n\nINNOVATIVE, SCALEABLE PLATFORM\nBusy Shapes’ innovative scaleable platform for evolving experimentation lets children take advantage of the time they spend on touch screens -- so they aren’t just having fun, but learning every second of the way.\n\nKID-FRIENDLY DESIGN\nBusy Shapes features a special “kid-friendly” design that compensates for the fact that when young children hold an iPad or iPhone, they often have a finger touching the screen.\n\n“PASSING” SWIPE CONTROL\nBusy Shapes features “passing” swipe control that is essential for young children's quick hands (i.e. even if a child's finger reaches an object after he or she was already touching the screen, the object is still grasped as intended).\n\nPOWERFUL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)\nBusy Shapes’ powerful AI supports each child’s unique learning journey. For example, the AI tracks the time it takes each child to complete a level, and increases or decreases difficulty accordingly.\n\nGUIDED ACCESS\nTo prevent children from exiting the app by pressing the “home” button, Busy Shapes features a customizable Guided Access. This feature also disables selected parts of the screen for safety and protection.\n\nSEAMLESS INTERACTION\nBusy Shapes’ seamless interactive game area never blocks or limits children, and lets them freely access shapes. The menu is also neatly hidden away.\n\nAUTOMATIC MEMORY\nSometimes the best learning is a combination of cognitive exercise and physical play. Busy Shapes’ automatic memory saves a child’s place in any particular game, which makes the app an ideal complement to physical play and for shorter games.\n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\nThe app is now available in: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Greek, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support request, please write at support@edokiacademy.com or visit the Edoki Academy Online Community at edokiacademy.com."

      "label": "Updated to continue to be the WORLD'S GREATEST BITS OF INTELLIGENCE APP FOR KIDS!\n\nSmartBits is an Educational Stimulation App designed for children between 4 months and 6 years old based on the Doman Method Program of Encyclopedic Knowledge.\n\nIt uses \"BITS OF INTELLIGENCE\" or \"Information Cards\", which are units of information in the form of precise, specific, clear, and innovative images for children. Each one shows a single element. BITS or Information Cards are categorized into groups according to subject. \n\nSmartBits helps children to:\n• Advance language skills.\n• Learn new vocabulary.\n• Develop visual and auditory capabilities.\n• Improve attention and concentration.\n\nSmartBits is a STIMULATION METHOD organized into sessions. The BITS are taught in full screen mode (visual stimulus) accompanied by an audio recording of the name of the element displayed (auditory stimulus).\n\n\nMODES OF OPERATION:\n\n• AUTOMATIC MODE. The image cards change automatically every 1.5 seconds. SmartBits adds new cards from time to time, removing the oldest from the relevant group. Once it has been displayed a sufficient number of times, the entire group is withdrawn. Adults should only be concerned with adding groups of cards to sessions when asked to do so by SmartBits.\n\n• MANUAL MODE. The adult or child work manually through the BITS from the chosen group. In this mode, the cards can be used without automatic audio reproduction to improve the child's verbal skill with the aid of an adult.\n\n• LOOP MODE. This displays all the cards from all available categories in one on-going session.\n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• Creation of multiple users, so several children can use the program independently.\n• Option to create two user profiles, one in each language, so a single child can use the program in both languages.\n• Option to show or hide text shown in all modes of operation to encourage reading.\n• User’s guide.\n• Settings panel for SmartBits users.\n• AUDIO RECORDING module to replace the card audio with new recordings in your own voice and/or recordings in another language. This module can be purchased from SmartBits.\n• Child protection feature to prevent access to the internet.\n• Suitable for children with special educational needs.\n\n\nCONTENTS:\n\nLibrary of information cards consisting of a total of 265 high-resolution images organized in 16 groups:\n\n• Mammals 1: 23 cards\n• Amphibians and Reptiles: 20\n• Fruits 1: 14\n• Vegetables 1: 15\n• Music Notes: 15\n• Wind Instruments: 13\n• Maths 1: 20\n• Maths 2: 20\n• Human Body Organs: 11\n• Parts of the Universe: 16\n• Monuments 1: 17\n• Roman Civilization: 18\n• American Countries: 15\n• European Countries: 12\n• Flags of European Countries: 23\n• Flags of Asian Countries: 13\n\n\nThe library can be extended up to 991 cards by purchasing additional cards from the application itself:\n\nCard Set #3: 127 cards\n• String Instruments: 12\n• Insects: 18\n• Portraits of Artists 1: 11\n• Transport: 19\n• Flowers: 16\n• Landforms: 16\n• Vegetables 2: 15\n• Maths 3: 20\n\nCard Set #4: 140 cards\n• Percussion Instruments: 13\n• Birds: 17\n• Tools 1: 17\n• Minerals: 19\n• Aromatic Herbs: 17\n• Fruits 2: 17\n• Maths 4: 20\n• Maths 5: 20\n\nCard Set #5: 118 cards\n• Toys 1: 13\n• Kitchen Utensils 1: 14\n• Mammals 2: 12\n• Parts of the Human Body: 16\n• School Supplies 1: 11\n• Monuments 2: 16\n• Colors: 12\n• Traffic Signs 1: 13\n• Home Furniture 2: 11\n\nCard Set #6: 110 cards\n• Food 1: 16\n• Home Appliances: 17\n• Clothes 1: 13\n• Toys 2: 14\n• Balls: 14\n• Portraits of Artists 2: 11\n• Actions 1: 11\n• Trees: 14\n\nCard Set #7: 118 cards\n• Toiletries: 14\n• Jobs: 19\n• Tools 2: 15\n• Dried Fruits: 12\n• Kitchen Utensils 2: 14\n• Clothes 2: 13\n• Mammals 3: 14\n• Monuments 3: 17\n\nCard Set #8: 113 cards\n• Home Furniture 1: 11\n• Roads: 13\n• Street Furniture: 12\n• Food 2: 16\n• Toys 3: 14\n• Portraits of Artists 3: 11\n• Schools Supplies 2: 11\n• Actions 2: 12\n• Traffic Signs 2: 13\n\n\nCONTACT:\nwww.smartbitsapp.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/smartbitsapp\nEmail: info@smartbitsapp.com"

      "label": "*** Previously Featured App in Apple's \"What's Hot\" for iPad education***\nNow 2 apps in 1!!!!  New Memory Match Game.\n\nLet's Hear the Animals! (Animal Sounds) is a universal iPhone/iPad application developed especially for pre-school children to see pictures of a variety of animals and to hear the sounds that they make.  It is designed as a basic program for children to use easily in any location – at home or in a car, bus, train, plane or stroller.  The child chooses an animal by touching a picture of the animal from a gallery view.  This view shows six animals per page (see screenshot).  Once your child taps on an animal's image from this main view, they will see a full screen image of that animal appear and they will hear the animal's name.  To hear the sound that the animal makes simply tap the picture of the animal which will now fill the screen in a beautiful landscape view. To return to the main view and select a different animal the child can select the white home button in the center of the screen on the bottom, or he/she can choose to see the next or previous animals by clicking the white left and right arrows.  By using these arrows, the child does not need to use the gallery view unless they want to skip a bunch of animals to get to their favorite.\n\nWith the 3.0 update, Let's Hear the Animals! became a bilingual educational tool; children can now enter an entirely spanish version of the application.  They select the animal from the gallery view and the hear the name of the animal in spanish.\n\nIt’s easy and fun!  Video demo available on Facebook page.\n\nThis application contains 40 unique images of 38 different animals.\n\nYou can expect to see and hear the following animals: Parrot, Dolphin, Monkey, Rattlesnake, Seal, Hyena, Killer Whale, Humpback Whale, Bee, Cicadas, Pig, Elephant (adult+child), Horse, Wolf, Crow, Crickets, Owl, Chimpanzee, Cow, Tiger, Lion, Frog, Kittens, Rooster, Elephant, Geese, Black Bear, Bear Cub, Woodpecker, Cheetah, Cuckoo, Donkey, Mosquito, Sheep, Crocodile, Goat, Duck, Dog, Rhinoceros.\n\nThe Kangaroo is the only animated sound (my three year old son's request).\n\nAt the end of the application, there are also ten pages containing four animals per page; perfect for overlapping and comparing sounds.\n\n// Support e-mail is working\nsupport@playengagelearn.com\n\n////Big Update 2-10-10/// \n\n1) The new Landscape View provides a more natural field of view.\n2) The name of the animal is now heard as the image appears on the screen.\n3) Bigger images now possible due to removal of the Display bar as per user requests.\n4) Return of Forward and Backward arrow navigation, with child/user option to use the gallery view if they prefer.\n5) Arrows now have a translucent center, so less of the animal is obscured from your view.\n6) Gallery icons are now rounded with no white background visible.\n7) All issues with sounds cutting short should be resolved with this update - if you move to the next animal in the middle of a sound playing that sound will be stopped.\n8) My e-mail is working and I can be reached at michaelsheehan@sheehanapplications.com or michael.sheehan@sheehanapplications.com\n 9) Special thanks to OC Rob D for leaving a review and letting me know of his issues with my application, while also letting everyone know that my app was a “HUGE hit” in his house.  I hope that you find all of the issues resolved and my e-mail working.\n10) I also included a link to review/rate my application within the application.  Please take the time to review my app.  With 100K apps on the iTunes Store your reviews help others find my application and I greatly appreciate your support."

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles. \n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE Math BINGO:\n- Does not contain third-party ads. \n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks. \n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools. \n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store. \n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit: http://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n ---------------------------"

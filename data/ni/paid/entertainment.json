      "label": "Calling all future scientists!\n\nWelcome to Toca Lab: Elements! Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science. While the periodic table in Toca Lab: Elements is accurate, the way new elements are created is not. Instead, it’s a fun way to experiment, discover and create curiosity in the world of science. Toca Lab: Elements is just a starting point for further exploration! \n\n***\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

So if you enjoy watching videos on your iPad, then the AVPlayer is an absolute necessity. \n\n• Support Formats\n- Dolby Digital (AC3), Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3)\n- Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- MP4,MOV,M4V\n- XVID,AVI,WMV,RMVB,ASF,H264,MKV… most of all movie file formats. \n- SMI, SRT, TXT, SubStationAlpha Subtitles \n\n• Post Processing \n- High quality video processing \n- Contrast,Saturation,Brightness \n- TV-Out \n\n• Control the playback speed (From 0.5X to 2.0X) \n- User setting support \n- Sweep to the left : move to backword 10 sec \n- Sweep to the right : move to forward 10 sec \n- Sweep to the top : 1.5X speed \n- Sweep to the down : normal speed \n\n• Additional features \n- Rotation Lock / Aspect ratio:auto/16:9/4:3/Full screen \n- Folder Management:Pass code/Move/Rename/Create \n- Resume play from last position \n- Scrubbing search \n- supports e-mail attachment by \"Open In\" feature \n\n• USB/WIFI Transfer \n\n• Note \n1. How to add video with USB \n- Run iTunes 9.1 or above \n- Device->My Device(My iPad)->Apps, drag and drop files to the AVplayer's documents \n\n2. Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal."

      "label": "You’ve discovered the Original and World Famous iFart® App.  An Apple All-Time TOP 20 App.  The definitive Fart Sounds app on iTunes.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nFeatured on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Today Show and many others, iFart® is considered the most infamous app of all time. \r\n\r\nAlso seen in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, MSNBC.com, MacDailyNews, MacForums, The New York Times, Barron's, Motley Fool, Gizmodo, Venture Beat, Ars Technica, CNET News, Geek.com, Forbes, The UK Register, Information Week, TechCrunch.com and dozens of publications all over the world!\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\niFart® took the app world by storm in 2008. It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

      "label": "*** Brag about your Pitch Speed! ***\n\n\"By far the most accurate baseball radar gun on the app store.\"\n\nDid you ever wonder how you compare against others, or against professional athletes? Is your pitch as fast as theirs, or at least in the same ballpark? Try using Baseball Radar Gun to see exactly how fast you can throw, right down to a tenth of a mile per hour. Baseball Radar Gun is a simple and precise way to test your strength and compete with your friends.\n\nGet the answers at a glance\nBaseball Radar Gun uses color coding for easy identification of your speed. The entire user interface will change in color according to the speed of your throw.\n\nPitch speeds and colors:\n\n► 76 Over Red - Watch out, the ball is about to go supersonic! That's a powerful shot!\n\n► 61-75  Orange - Fast! People would do well to get out of your way when you have a ball in your hand.\n\n► 51-60  Yellow - pretty darn good! Your pitch is pretty fast, that's quite the arm you have there!\n\n► 41-50  Green - the speed of your throw is pretty average; although it can be improved, it's nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n► 00-40  Blue - indicating a slow pitch; that's okay, everybody has their off days.\n\nHow it works\nBaseball Radar Gun uses a really simple method to accurately calculate the pitch speed. Simply press Start when the ball leaves the pitcher's hand, and press Stop when you see the ball land in the catcher's hand.

      "label": "Get ready to rescue baby dinosaurs with Blaze and AJ in Blaze’s Dinosaur Egg Rescue Game!  \n\nThis iPhone app exposes preschoolers to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) concepts as they travel through Dino Valley with Blaze and AJ to find lost dinosaur eggs.\n\nThroughout the adventure, children are encouraged to develop problem-solving strategies and complete physics-based puzzles using water, bouncy balls and lasers to rescue dinosaur eggs from dangerous situations. Each location contains between one to three eggs, along with a hidden prehistoric gem!\n\nTOOLS: To rescue the dinosaur eggs, children are encouraged to manipulate the following tools and simple machines:\n-\tWheels\n-\tPulleys\n-\tCranks\n-\tLevers\n-\tMirrors (static and rotating)\n-\tSolar panels\n-\tPendulums\n\nCONCEPTS: In addition to experimenting with different tools, children are exposed to the following STEM concepts:\n-\tHeight (e.g. moving Blaze up or down to reach certain locations)\n-\tWeight (e.g. adding objects to a  bucket connected to a pulley)\n-\tTrajectory (e.g. manipulating the path of water, bouncy balls or a laser)\n-\tAdhesion (e.g. using a “sticky patch” to trap items and construct a path to complete the puzzle)\n\nHANDS-ON APPROACH TO LEARNING\nThis educational iPhone game for kids fosters a hands-on, experiential approach to STEM learning through critical-thinking challenges that enhance children’s understanding of physics puzzles and how things work. Kids learn with the help of their best friend Blaze - the coolest truck from the popular Nick Jr TV show!\n\nADDITIONAL GAME FEATURES\n-\t3 Blaze transformations – Blaze can shoot water, bouncy balls, or laser beams!\n-\tExplore three locations in Dino Valley and navigate different types of terrain – the jungle, rocky plateaus and a volcano!\n-\t45 levels – Solve forty-five physics puzzles to locate over 80 dinosaur eggs and a prehistoric gem on every level! \n\n\nBlaze and the Monster Machines Dinosaur Rescue collects personal user data as well as non-personal user data (including aggregated data).

It was the first comic reader in the App Store, it’s still the best. \n\n• Organize your collection how YOU want. Put series inside series, use dividers to manage long lists.\n• Automatically sorts comics into their series.\n• Super fast reading view with two-page mode and assisted panning.\n• Page position lock so you don’t see the same borders page after page.\n• Does the right thing when you rotate your device, many comics have a mixture of portrait and landscape pages.\n• Lightning fast search, by comic title and tags.\n• Parental lock for individual series.\n\nIN APP PURCHASES\n\nFor a very reasonable price you can also unlock\n•  Comic Finders, create smart series that show you unread comics from all over your library.\n•  Seven new, gorgeous themes.\n\nCOMIC IMPORT \n\n• WI-Fi using a web browser on a PC or Mac.\n• Drop Box, iCloud Drive, etc using iOS document sharing.\n• AirDrop from a Mac.\n• iTunes via USB or Wi-FI\n\nTHE SLIDER\n\nComic Zeal features the innovative slider, it's a pointer, a container and a toolbox, all in one.  You can push stuff into it, then go anywhere in your collection and drag it out.  It's an incredibly fast way to organize your comics.\n\nWith the slider you can:\n\n• Reorder comics, put them into the slider in the order you want them, then drag them out.\n• Create reading lists (by making copies of comics that don't take up any space on your device)\n• Create series and dividers right in the app.  Dividers are lists that can hold comics, series and even other dividers.\n\nTIPS\n\n• Tap the ‘i’ info icon for comics, series and dividers. You can rename entries, sort a series or mark items as read or unread.\n• When zooming, hold the gesture for half a second.  Comic Zeal will lock that zoom and position when you turn the page, it's a great way to hide borders.  \n\nComics used in the screenshots:\n'Escape from Planet Nowhere',  © 2010 Otis Frampton, http://planet-nowhere.com/\n\nPlease note, there is a problem with Google Drive’s iOS extension that doesn’t allow you to open comic and other files that they consider to be ’non-standard’.  You can read more about it here: https://goo.gl/EKVRbN and here https://goo.gl/XXYRQI . You can open Comics from the Google Drive app itself using the 'Open in ...' option, just not directly from Comic Zeal."

Increíblemente preciso independientemente de la cultura, raza, género, fe, o el origen étnico, este calendario es profundamente relevante para la experiencia humana. \n\nMeticulosamente investigada, la aplicación está diseñada para ayudarte a comprender el significado de los signos del día y los números (los elementos esenciales del Tzolk'in), y para hacerte descubrir las 260 energías del día que componen.\n\nPor primera vez en la plataforma móvil, la serie entera de estas energías está disponible en su forma completa: 260 energías diarias únicas, escritas para reflejar las realidades de la vida moderna.  \n\nMCP Tzolkin Maya incluye:\n• Juego completo de las 260 \"Energías del Día\" del calendario Tzolkin, cada energía interpretada bajo el contexto de la vida moderna, teniendo en cuenta no sólo el significado del signo del día y el número, sino también el contexto general de la Trecena actual.\n\n• Glifos gráficos elegantes de todos los signos del día, números y dioses\n\n• Una calculadora para convertir fechas gregorianas (occidentales) en fechas del Tzolkin\n\n• Una divertida rueda interactiva que ayuda a visualizar el calendario Tzolkin: 3 anillos concéntricos demuestran los 20 signos del día, los 13 números, y los 13 dioses mesoamericanos asociados con los 13 números\n\n• Descripciones completas de los 20 signos del día y los 13 números, basadas en las tradiciones de los mayas de Guatemala\n\n• Descripciones completas de los 13 dioses asociados con los trece números\n\n• Explicación de la naturaleza y significado del calendario Tzolkin, incluyendo una lista de los 20 signos del día y los 13 números tanto en lengua yucateca como en quiché maya\n\nMientras que muchas otras aplicaciones toman sus descripciones de los signos del día, los números y las \"energías\" de varias fuentes que no son maya o son mal interpretadas, las \"Energías del Día\" en la app MCP Tzolkin Maya se basan en las interpretaciones y auténticas prácticas del Tzolkin que nos compartieron los maya de las tierras altas guatemaltecas y los investigadores académicos con largos años de experiencia viviendo y trabajando con los maya.\n\nAhora puedes llevarte las 260 \"Energías del día\" de este calendario sagrado donde quiera que vayas, ya que una conexión a la Internet no es necesaria.\n\n\nEl Portal del Calendario Maya y todas sus propiedades, incluyendo la aplicación móvil MCP Tzolkin Maya, son producidos por LUCITA Inc."

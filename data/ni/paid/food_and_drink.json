      "label": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

      "label": "\"Kitchen Scales\" is the only app that, through a simple and pleasant interface, allows you to measure the amount of sugar, flour or liquids in a container of your choice.\n\nThe operation is very simple:\n\n1 - The first thing you will need is a glass or a regular-sized cup, preferably a transparent one.\n\n2 - Select what you want to measure and the shape of the container, either cylindrical or rectangular. Also remember to select the thickness of the edges and the bottom. A difference of a few millimetres will result in errors of several tens of grams.\n\n3 - Place the phone on the container.\n\n4 - Use your fingers to choose the diameter, making it match that of the container.\n\n5 - Place the phone next to the container and use your finger to choose the level of the measurement. If your phone has a cover, remove it, otherwise SUBTRACT the thickness of the cover from the thickness of the edge.\n\n6 - At this point you'll get the grams or millilitres if you are measuring a liquid.\n\nFor the first few times check the measurements, just to get started. Measurements made with this application are only approximate. They are quite precise, but they cannot be compared to measurements on scales."

      "label": "Catador replicates the industry standard SCAA coffee cupping scoresheet with an easy-to-use system of sliders to rate sensory criteria and tick boxes to mark off-cups in the categories of Uniformity, Clean Cup and Sweetness. \n\nTouching the Notes line launches a virtual keyboard so that you can record your comments and total scores are tallied immediately and accurately on the right hand side in the Total Score box. So simple, and yet it works perfectly.\n\nCatador goes further to include administrative features that make it even more useful in the field.\n\nFrom the Home screen, you can add and delete cupping flights, identifying the number of samples in each group, which are given generic alphabetic labels or numbers that can be given unique names. (Both Arabica and Robusta are available)\n\nAfter the day’s cupping is done (or when asked to turn in your Q Grader cupping evaluation), users can also permanently lock each flight so that it cannot be changed later. The system gives you a popup warning that the operation cannot be undone.\n\nNo cupping scoresheet application can be fully functional in the real world unless you have some way to export the data. Catador presently includes an email function that sends scores as a text document to any email address, as well as a .CSV file which may be imported into other applications or a worksheet. \n\nThere is also an Airprint option, where you may print the output to any Airprint enabled printer wirelessly.\n\nOn the latest version, you may also share your sessions using the Airdrop feature on all supported iOS devices."

In BLW (Baby Led Weaning) you don't put spoons, or pieces of food in your baby’s mouth. You simply offer your baby food, and he eats what he wants.\n\nBaby-led weaning allows babies to control their solid food consumption by \"self-feeding\" from the very beginning of their experiences with food. Baby-led weaning places the emphasis on exploring taste, texture, color and smells as the baby sets their own pace for the meal, and chooses which foods to concentrate on. Instead of spooning food into your baby's mouth, you present him or her with varied finger foods from which to choose and he or she chooses what to eat and how much. If she doesn't touch the oatmeal balls you made for her you do not put them in her mouth, you just offer them to her again at another meal."

      "label": "Sugar is in everything these days, from boxed cereals to pasta sauces; it's almost impossible to avoid unless you're eating a real food diet. The 7 Day Sugar-Free Detox was designed by the Young and Raw team of expert nutritionists and holistic health coaches to create a fun and cleansing experience for you while you break free from the chains of sugar. \n\nStudies show sugar can be highly addictive, so rest assured we've got your back when it comes to kicking it for good! Inside this detox, you're going to find two meal plans to choose from. Our Low-Sugar Plan has small amounts of natural sugar found in fruits. Our No-Sugar Plan is completely sugar free.\n\nRefined or processed sugar is incomplete in its nutrient profile, lacking minerals and vitamins required by our bodies for digestion. What ends up happening when we eat sugar, is our bodies have to seek out the proper minerals required for digestion and unfortunately, those minerals are \"borrowed\" from our mineral reserves. This can lead to mineral deficiency and other health issues that are today, considered \"modern diseases\". \n\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox is designed to support:\n- Breaking sugar addiction\n- Weight loss\n- Liver & Kidney detox\n- Skin health \n- Balancing blood sugar \n- Mood balancing\n- Energy levels\n- Adrenal fatigue\n\nInside the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox you will find:\n- Low-Sugar Meal Plan which includes some fruit sugars\n- No-Sugar Meal Plan which is 100% sugar free\n- Recipes - along with a list of health benefits for each recipe\n- Shopping lists - to make shopping quick and easy, you can tick off items from the list\n- Morning and evening routines - including how to get a perfect night of sleep\n- Young and Raw's favorite books, quotes & documentaries\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the plan work to reset the body?\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox was carefully crafted by experts to get you results while maintaining your sanity throughout the process! \n\nBy replacing sugar with fresh leafy greens, vegetables, seaweeds and seeds along with an abundance of healthy fats, your body will be less hungry for sugar. In the beginning, you may notice a withdrawal period as your body adjusts to running off of fat and real food rather than sugar and carbohydrates. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, it's not easy, but we know you can do it!\n\nThe meal plans have everything you need to detox, and because there are no added or refined sugars your liver and kidneys will get a much needed break from processed sugar.\n\nFor 7 days you're going to experience what it's like to enjoy only real, whole foods but don't forget that diet is only one part of the equation. Proper detox also includes getting enough fresh clean water and optimizing your sleep. Our sleep cycles ensure the body gets its time to effectively detox, renew and heal. The included sleep protocol was designed based on all of the information we have about the importance of optimized sleep and the experiments we have done, to create a protocol that really works. \n\nYour herbal protocol is always optional and if you're on any medications, pregnant or have a health condition, it's advised that you speak with your physician and consult an herbalist prior to taking new supplements. The herbal protocol is minimal yet powerful, including some of the most elite herbs for detoxing the liver, kidneys, creating clear skin and boosting energy in the process. \n\nIn Summary, the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox helps to reset the body by:\n- Gently cleansing the body and promoting toxin elimination\n- Gently introducing blood cleansing foods\n- Providing the body with enough healthy fats to begin removing a reliance upon sugar and processed carbohydrates\n- Encouraging a healthy sleep cycle \n- Creates a movement routine to stimulate the lymphatic system, the endocrine system and the detox organs\n- Hydrating effectively to flush the body of excess toxins and create electrolyte balance"

      "label": "Save time and money managing your fridge and pantry with Kiff, and always eat your food in its best state possible.\n\nBy eating fresh food, you waste less, save money, and help the planet. With a unique UI and beautiful details, Kiff is the perfect companion in your journey to reduce food waste at home.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• Add your packaged food in seconds with the barcode scanner.\n\n• Keep expiration dates under control so you can eat your groceries before it's too late.\n\n• Food open or stored for too long? Track the time since you opened, bought, or cooked your food.\n\n• Set the desired shelf life for each food and eat them before the time runs out.\n\n• Alerts, always on time. Kiff will notify you when your food is due soon.\n\n• Manage the food inventory and automatically add low-stock food to a list in the system's Reminders app.\n\n• All your groceries and leftovers in one app. Always in sight, so you know what to eat at a glance.\n\n• Find out what categories of food you consume and throw away more, and even identify those specific items that you always end up tossing away thanks to the consumption insights.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK\n\nWhen you arrive home from the grocery store and before storing your food in the fridge or pantry, open Kiff and add each item to the app. As easy as setting a shelf life and an expiration date, if they have one.\n\nYou don't have to add all the groceries at once. Start with fresh produce and food that goes in the fridge or freezer. You can add those items stored in the pantry or with the farthest expiration date later on.\n\nFor leftovers and when you cook for the whole week, just right after storing them in the fridge or freezer, open Kiff, and add them. As easy as setting a shelf life and starting the tracker.\n\nThat's it! Kiff will remind you to eat your leftovers and groceries before they go bad.\n\nABOUT KIFF\n\nYou open the fridge any day, and there they are, the sour milk, the expired yogurt, bad-looking leftovers, or the rotten lemon. The incredible thing is that about 1/3 of the world's food production is lost or wasted—1.3 billion tons per year, around 170 and 180 kilos per person. The output of 30% of the planet's agricultural land (that's greater than the size of China!), along with 170 billion cubic meters of water, all wasted.\n\nOnce all this food breaks down, it produces a carbon footprint of 4.4 billion tons of CO2 each year. Between 8 and 10% of the global greenhouse emissions. The third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, just after China and the USA.\n\n40% of all this waste is generated at home—expired produce and discarded or gone bad leftovers that we throw away because we have cooked too much. The annual cost for each family can be a surprising amount between $1,200 and $1,800 US dollars, depending on where you live on the planet.\n\nWe build Kiff with one goal in mind: help you eat your food in its best state possible. Because food loses its nutritional capabilities after keeping it for too long, and if spoiled, it can be a risk for your health. By eating fresh food, you waste less, save money, and help the planet.\n\nMORE\n\n• Visit https://kiff.app to know more.\n\n• Discover more about food waste at https://kiff.app/awareness/\n\n• Check out our tips at https://kiff.app/support/\n\n• Check out our Food and Leftovers Shelf Life Guide at https://kiff.app/support/tips/food-shelflife-guide/ to learn how long your food can be stored."

This is a huge time saver!\n\nAnd, on the iPad, once you’ve used the app for a few weeks, the Magic Wand will help you quickly fill out subsequent weeks, with a quick suggestions interface.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Simple interface to plan out meals.\n- Keep track of recipes and the groceries they use.\n- Automatically generated grocery list based on your meal plan.\n- Save grocery lists for later use (think \"Party\" or \"Camping\").\n- Save a week's planned meals as a template to reuse.\n- Combined search/add box makes it easy to add new items.\n- Print out a week's plan to any AirPrint printer.\n- Configure your own meals: Add snacks, or remove breakfast if you don't want to plan it.\n- Email a plain text summary of the week's plan.\n- Add a note to any meal item, including clickable links.\n- Dropbox sync for families with multiple devices and accounts.\n- Use Siri for groceries: \"Add Milk to my Grocery List\".\n\n\"Before MealPlan, I’d buy food at the grocery store and then forget I had it .. a few days later it would go to waste. A few minutes every week standing in front of the fridge with MealPlan in hand will help you get the most out of what you have on hand. Plan it, print it out and stick it to your fridge!\"\n\nVisit the website for more information, and a detailed walkthrough of what MealPlan can do."

Then you probably own a circulator or a similar device. To start, a zip-bag, a cooking pot and a thermometer is all you need. Many Sous Vide recipes work without special equipment. But you will need good advice!\n\nSous Vide has been adopted in professional kitchens for producing precise and consistent results. The Sous Vide method produces perfectly cooked food with outstanding flavor. Its success in high-end cuisine changed the culinary world. With a few starting tips anyone can use this technique. Step-by-step tutorials and Sous Vide timers (mini-recipes with an alarm) help you along the way.\n\nIdeas, suggestions or anything you would like to change? Contact us with your feedback on UserVoice!\n\nThe time for a piece of meat to reach a core temperature can be calculated. A formula using thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and surface heat transfer calculates the time such shapes as cylinders, cubes and steaks need to acquire a certain core temperature. Consider the PolyScience Toolbox App or Douglas Baldwin’s formulas for calculating pasteurization times.\n\nBut food is never an exact geometrical shape and waiting for an extra hour for a piece to reach an additional half a degree is impractical. Adjustments for speed and efficiency improve the Sous Vide experience. We have tested Sous Vide recommendations that work and tutorials that make the first steps easy - for professionals and home cooks alike!\n\nSous Vide - no other cooking method gives you so much control!\n\nDon’t get the Anova Pro or the new Anova Precision Cooker (2019) as these devices are no longer equipped with Bluetooth!"

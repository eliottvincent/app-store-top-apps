      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.

      "label": "Track your eating, hit your goals, and focus on your success, all in one easy-to-use app. Inspired by the USDA's MyPlate icon, My Daily Plate makes eating right easy and fun. Leave the calorie counting to us. \n\nTrainers love My Daily Plate for the export feature that emails your progress right to them, and users love the positive focus on what you should eat, rather than what you shouldn’t. Both love the simple Today’s Plate home screen, which shows your daily goals and progress in one colorful glance. \n\nWith this easy, user-friendly app, there is no typing, no keyboard, no data entry required. With a few simple taps, you enter your food and track your success. \n\nWe help you focus on the bigger picture of nutrition- eating the right portions of the right foods –so that calorie maintenance naturally occurs. There are no categories for foods that fall outside of these groups (i.e. junk food), because those foods do not contribute to your daily requirements and overall nutrition goals, which is what we’re focused on. \nIt’s not only about what’s healthy, but how much. All too often, people looking to eat right, eat wrong, erring on the side of too much protein, too few fruits, or out of proportion portions. With this app, you can clearly and simply see whether or not you are eating enough fruits, vegetables, protein, grains and dairy, and can adjust your next meal accordingly. \n\nThe rewards are both instant and long-term! \n\nStart thinking about what’s significantly contributing to your nutritional needs rather than trying to track all the bad food you eat. Rather than feeling guilty about your bad choices each day, feel proud of and track your good choices using My Daily Plate app. \n\n** Over 28,000 copies of My Daily Plate have been downloaded! ** \n\nMy Daily Plate has four sections: \n\nTODAY’S PLATE \n- Filling your plate at each meal is quick and easy. Just tap the food group, item, and quantity. \n- The plate clears itself at midnight so you can start fresh the next morning. \n- A healthy way to monitor everything you eat in the course of a day. \n- Enter the water you drink in your preferred unit of measurement, but see equivalent amounts in other units.\n\nMY PROGRESS\n- Track your progress visually instead of deciphering lots of figures.\n- Check and see how you did the previous day.\n- Get an average of progress of the last 7 days.\n- Get an overall average of the recorded days since the date of your first entry. \n- View your daily average calories.\n\nHISTORY\n- Export your data to a CSV file (comma delimited) and send to your personal trainer or dietician.\n- Review your eating habits on a specific day. \n- Edit any existing entry.\n- Add a previous entry you forgot to make. \n\nSETTINGS\n- View the daily calorie goal recommended by the USDA based on your profile information.\n- Set your daily calorie goal based on your preference or personal trainer/dietician’s guidance.\n- Set your preferred units of measurement for water intake. (fl oz, mL, L, pt, c) \n- Enable/disable the alert message when you reach a specific daily goal. \n- Delete all the entries in your database to wipe the slate clean and start again."

Doom Climbs, Celebrity Face Punches, and Dragon Mating Dances. \n\nYou get 30 seconds for each of the 12 punishing exercises,* with 10 seconds of rest in between just in case you need to hydrate, catch your breath, or vomit into a bucket.\n\nThis diabolical interval workout can be completed anywhere, at any time, so you have no excuse not to be in fighting shape when the Robopocalypse begins.\n\n*12 additional exercises can be unlocked via in-app purchase.\n\n---\n\nLose (or Gain) Weight In Style\nAre you ready to have so much fun tracking your weight that you'll actually look forward to hopping on your scale? All you have to do is punch in your current weight, then sit back and let CARROT pass judgment upon you.\n\nWARNING: If you blimp up or slim down too much, CARROT will be upset.

See how many steps you've taken today, chart your weight loss on a pretty graph, view your workouts on a calendar, and more!\n\nAnd because CARROT syncs with Apple's Health app, she can save your weight and workout data to the HealthKit database. She can also monitor fitness activity logged with other HealthKit-compatible apps, even when you're not actively using her.\n\n---\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Work out with a hilarious AI construct\n- Enjoy 3+ hours of spoken tips, encouragement, and ridicule\n- Travel through time, protect your property from hobos, and appease an elder god in 12 original, never-before-seen exercises\n- Get 12 additional exercises via in-app purchase\n- Apple Watch app works as a heads-up display for your workout\n- Record your weight up to once a day\n- Bond with your cute & cuddly meatbag avatar\n- Level up and unlock rewards for getting fit\n- Set reminders so you'll never forget a workout\n- Track your weight progress on a pretty graph\n- Set a goal weight that you'll likely never meet\n- See how many steps you've taken today\n- Check your BMI to determine if you're still obese\n- Sync data with Apple's Health app\n\nDon't make CARROT angry.

      "label": "Download the most popular breathing app in the world!\n\nPranayama was engineered to teach your body how to breathe properly. Babies naturally breathe diaphragmatically, however adults often take shallow breaths. By training your lungs to breathe at their full capacity, you could experience a whole ton of health benefits!\n\nPracticing slow breathing for only 15 minutes a day can reduce stress and stress-related illnesses. Universal Breathing - Pranayama was created by doctors, designers and app developers to provide the perfect breathing experience. Using the app allows you to focus on your breathing technique and mindful breathing. Use the different music styles to condition your body to either wake up in the morning or relax before you go to sleep.\n\nHEALTH BENEFITS\n\nFalling asleep faster\nHigher athletic endurance\nHelp managing asthma and COPD\nDecreased blood pressure\nRelief from headaches and migraines\nLess stress and better mood\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT\n\nSaagara’s breathing apps have been used by hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world since 2008.

But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance.

HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling.

      "label": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "“Worked great for his bedtime—the look on his face was so calmed.” Christi (mother of 3 week old)\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher is a soothing sounds machine to calm & stop baby crying cycle\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher App is a revolutionary new tool for parents that will calm baby easily using soothing sounds. This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter.

How to stimulate your baby's mental development and help him turn his 10 predictable, great, fussy phases into magical leaps forward describes the incredible mental developmental changes (leaps) and regression periods that all babies go through. Understanding the real reason behind crying, eating and sleeping problems is the only real solution every parent needs. The Wonder Weeks reveals what’s going on inside baby’s mind.\n\nThe audio-book includes:\n•\tWeek-by-week guide to baby's behavior\n•\tWhen to expect the fussy behavior, what this implies (cranky, clingy, crying (the three C's) behavior) and how to deal with these regression periods (leaps)\n•\tA description from your baby's perspective of the world around him and how you can understand the changes he's going through\n•\tFun games and gentle activities you can do with your child\n\nThe audio book is based on the scientific- and parental-world-changing discovery of a phenomenon: all normal, healthy babies appear to be more fussy at very nearly the same ages, regression periods, and sleep less in these phases.\n\nThese age-related fluctuations in need for body contact and attention (regression periods) are related to major and quite dramatic changes in the brains of the children. These changes enable a baby to enter a whole new perceptual world and, as a consequence, to learn many new skills. This should be a reason for celebration, but as far as the baby is concerned these changes are bewildering. He's taken aback—everything has changed overnight. It is as if he has woken up on a strange planet. He needs you to guide him and understand what he is going through! Get ready to rediscover the world all over again with your baby…"

This format is intuitive for the new user. There is an option to use the traditional stamp or symbol format if desired.\n\nTablet users: Users should consider using the web interface from tablets (see below).\n\nbillingsMentor® is also available as a web service. All data, whether submitted from mobile, tablet or desktop is stored on the billingsMentor® server. Thus your current fertility chart is always available from mobile or internet and is recoverable in the case of a lost or stolen phone.\n\nWhen you begin to use the service, you make a privacy agreement.\n\nReference: The Billings Method, by Dr Evelyn Billings and Dr Ann Westmore, Penguin Books, first published 1980, new edition 2011."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

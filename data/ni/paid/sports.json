By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

It automatically calculates your pressure groups and can even find your minimum surface interval. It’s quick and simple and super easy to use. \n\nTo calculate your pressure groups just enter your depth (feet or meters) and time (min) for your first dive. Then enter your surface interval between dives in minutes. After that enter your second dive depth and time the same way, and the program will calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nTo calculate your minimum surface interval between dives enter the depth and time of your first dive. Then enter the depth and time of your second dive. The program will now find your minimum surface interval and then calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nThis program uses only the standard PADI dive tables. It can NOT calculate reverse profile dives. Reverse profile dives are when the second dive is deeper than the first. Unless you absolutely know what you are doing always dive shallower than the last dive. \n\nDisclaimer: This application is not a replacement for diving tables, dive computers, or experience.

Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

Determining the solunar period is therefore useful for activities such as birdwatching, fishing or hunting. There are two major and two minor solunar periods each day. The time at which each solunar occurs varies depending on the date and on your geographical location.\n\nThe app helps you to determine the solunar period and expected animal activity index (where 6-point is when animals are most active). It also tells you the exact sunrise, sunset, sun transit, moon rise, moon set, and moon transit times, alone with moon phase. The app can utilize your iPhone's build-in GPS to obtain your geographical location. In case you are using iTouch or without GPS signal, the app also accepts user input of longitude and latitude. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n.Locations: GPS or Manual Entry\n.Major & Minor Periods\n.Activity Index\n.Moonrise / Moonset Times\n.Moon Phase Data\n.Sunrise / Sunset Times\n.Sun Transit\n.Moon Transit\n.Day / Week View\n.Any Date\n.Any Location - Worldwide\n\nNo network is needed.

Punch speed on iPhone 4S may be 2 times lower, but duration and reaction time are still correct.

Power is calculated approximately, with special formula based on your skills level, punch speed, and your mass. Put your mass in a punch to get more accurate result. Distance is calculated with small deviation when you punch the air. You get a straight distance between punch starting point and punch ending point. Time accuracy is limited to 10 ms.\n\nWarning! Use this app only at your own risk! Make sure that you hold your iPhone strong enough and be careful when you punch! Developer disclaims any responsibility."

      "label": "It calculates the average and maximum speed of a baseball with great accuracy using video frame-by-frame calculations.  It is easy to use and it does not rely on the user’s reflexes to calculate the speed of the ball.\n\nVERY ACCURATE\nMyRadarGun can use slow motion video (frame-at-a-time) to calculate the time it takes for a ball to travel from the pitcher to the catcher.  Knowing the distance, MyRadarGun accurately calculates the average and maximum speed of the ball, typically within +/- 1 MPH.  Using slow motion, frame-at-a-time video with image zoom to calculate the speed of the ball is almost as accurate as using an expensive baseball radar gun at a fraction of the price.\n\nEASY TO USE\nUnlike most other baseball radar gun apps, where the user must tap a button when the ball is pitched and tap again when the ball is caught, with MyRadarGun the user only needs to take a video of the pitcher throwing the ball to a catcher.  The video is then viewed one frame-at-a-time and the frame where the ball leaves the pitcher’s hand and the frame where the ball enters the catcher’s mitt are identified.  The user can zoom in and out and backup and go forward one frame-at-a-time until the exact frame where the ball leaves the pitcher’s hand and the exact frame where the catcher catches the ball are identified.\n\nFOR USE BY PITCHERS OR THE COACH\nMyRadarGun can save the average and maximum speed of any number of pitches along with the pitcher’s name, jersey number, date and time.  The speeds can be used to compare different potential pitchers or determine the pitcher’s speed using different pitching techniques.  The speeds can also be used to evaluate a pitcher’s speeds over time.  A coach can use the app during a game to evaluate how the pitcher is doing in real-time. Knowing how the pitcher is doing can be used to determine if the pitcher should be changed.  The coach can even determine the speed of the opposing teams pitchers.   \n\nFEATURES & BENEFITS\n- Accurate speed determination\n- Average and maximum speeds\n- Doesn’t require good reflexes\n- Supports SLO-MO video\n- Allows zooming in on video\n- Embedded with helpful messages\n- Pitchers identified by name & number\n- Multiple throws saved per pitcher\n- Multiple pitchers speeds saved\n- Sorted by pitcher name and date\n- Any throw distance can be used\n- Reports speed in MPH or KPH\n- Complete instructions included"

Each performance can be shared by email or shared in the different social networks. Allows you to time multiple athletes at the same time.\n\nIt allows you to Import/Export athletes. This is useful when you have a big roaster of athletes and needs to be imported to the app. Also if you have the app installed in different devices (iPad and iPhone), it facilitates the process of keeping on sync the roaster. \n\nIt allows to predefine Teams of athletes (before the meet). These teams, along with individual athletes, are available to pick from when using the app during meets; these expedite you the process of timing events during the meet.\n\nSmart Stop feature: because this app has preloaded the events, it knows exactly when the final lap is, so it will stop the stopwatch at the end of the final lap, regardless of the button you use (lap or stop). For Individual events, splits can be set at the 200m mark or 400m mark based on your preferences. When splits are set to 200m, it also allows you to use this app for indoor events. This application also supports hurled events, allowing to record splits per hurdle (touch downs), including support for events with 4, 5, 8 or 10 hurdles.\n\nBecause StopWatch for Track and Field knows the event characteristics, you can record: \n\n-The distance for each split \n-The estimated time at the finish line!! \n-The estimated time of your relay team \n-The Individual splits per leg in relay events\n\nVisit our website to see our demo videos: http://goo.gl/ymuFQ or follow us in Twitter @StopWatchTF\n\nIf you have question, suggestions, issues, before writting it in a review, first don't hesitate to contact us to stopwatchtf@gmail.com"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

Professor Harris was inspired to explore this realm after his training with Rickson Gracie, who felt remarkably different from the other Gracie family members because of his mastery of pressure, and because of the pressure he felt from Rigan Machado and Joe Moreira.\n\nThis is an advanced topic, requiring practitioners to have an intermediate skill level in the overall BJJ game."

I put ten shots on each target and I haven't had an error yet. It is so good at determining shot placement it's almost like artificial intelligence. Just make sure to use an official target or the app won't work. With an approved target, it's brilliant.\"\n– Stone Glasgow, United States\n\n\"A great tool for getting people to see their shot fall and make adjustments. Good fun as well.\"\n– S7evie P, NSRA Club Instructor, UK\n\n\"This app has helped bring our shooters' scores from embarrassing to respectable in just a few short weeks.\"\n– North of 68, Couch, Canada's Arctic\n\n\"This App has helped me identify my shooting patterns and is a great tool.

      "label": "Earthquake Network is the most comprehensive app on earthquakes and for most world countries it is the only earthquake early warning system for receiving real time alerts.\n\nEarthquake Network gives you:\n\n- Real time alerts if you live close to the epicentre\n- Alerts seconds in advances if you live far from the epicentre\n- Real time user reports on felt earthquakes\n- Free earthquake data from 21 seismic networks including U.S., Puerto Rico, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, China, New Zeland, Japan, Italy, Croatia, Spain and Greece\n\nThe Earthquake Network research project (https://www.sismo.app) aims at developing a smartphone-based earthquake early warning system able to detect earthquakes in real time and to alert the population in advance. Smartphones are able to detect earthquakes thanks to the accelerometer on-board each device. When an earthquake is detected, users with the application installed are immediatly alerted. Since earthquake waves travel at around 5 km/s it is possible to alert the population not yet reached by the damaging waves of the earthquake. For the scientific details about the project please refer to the scientific paper on Frontiers at https://bit.ly/2C8B5HI\n\nSubscriptions:\n\nWhen an earthquake is detected in real time by smartphones near the epicenter, the server sends an alert to all users with the app. Alerting all users can take up to 10 seconds since it is not technically feasible to do so instantly. Now you can join the priority lists of the first 10,000 or 100,000 people alerted in real time. The following subscriptions are available:\n\n- Subscription 10k for 1 year\n- Subscription 10k for 1 month \n\n- Subscription 100k for 1 year\n- Subscription 100k for 1 month \n\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nPrivacy: https://www.sismo.app/privacy\n\nTerms and conditions: https://www.sismo.app/terms-conditions"

The app gives you the best hunting times for your location, so you can plan your hunting trips much better! \nWhat people say: …This is a great app and I refer to it regularly during the hunting season. It's accurate! I experienced deer movement more during the times forecasted.\n\nHow does it work? Best hunting times are calculated based on the information about the Moon and the Sun for your specific location. Always know best hunting days and specific times with Hunting Aid application!\n\nHighlights:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n- Best Hunting Times for Your Specific Location\n- Hunting Spots, Photos and Records\n- Moon and Sun Data\n- Hunting Calendar\n- Weather Forecast\n- Automatic Location on the Map\n- Flashlight with blinking mode\n- Works with no Internet connection\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBEST DAY ON HUNTING CALENDAR\nBest days for hunting are shown right on the calendar - the longer the bar, the better chance you have this day to get a trophy. Tap on the buttons on the top to show sunrise and sunset times, day length or moonrise and moonset. Double tap on a day will add a note in the calendar.\n\nHUNTING TIMES\nThe best times for hunting during the day are shown next to an icon with three red shells. One shell icon shows just good times for hunting. Tap on the icons to see the times on a clock.\n\nVISUAL CHARTS\nAnimal activity index chart shows best time for hunting to increase hunting success during the day. The higher the value on the chart, the better chances you will have to get another trophy. \n\nTROPHY PICTURES\nStore all your trophies and their pictures on the map. If you would like to mark your favorite spot, tap on \"Map\" and place a label. Add multiple pictures of your trophies, notes and weather condition to the selected label. Later you can share your trophy pics via email.\n\nMOON AND SUN INFORMATION\nSelect any date for checking Solunar and moon and sun data in advance.\n- Length of day - on the calendar.\n- Sunrise and sunset times.\n- Moonrise and moonset times.\n- Moon phases for each day - right on the calendar.\n\nSOLUNAR CALENDAR\nSolunar table is used to show best days and time to hunt -  right on the calendar. This is a quick and easy way to know when to get some great trophies with high success rate!\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nCheck the weather condition and store it along with the pictures of your trophy. To get more accurate weather forecast select a specific time using a slider. \n\nTYPES OF HUNTING\nBest hunting times are great for duck hunting and turkey hunting as well as for large animal hunt: deer hunting, whitetail hunting, elk hunting, bear hunting, hog hunting etc. All major types of hunting follows Solunar calendar very well.\n\nFLASHLIGHT\nAlways have a powerful flashlight handy: adjust brightness, blinking interval or flash text using Morse code.\n\nMAP LABELS AND LOCATION\nBuild your own favorite location list. Add labels to the map and select your location - simply tap on the coordinates.\n\nNO INTERNET REQUIRED \nAll features work anywhere even without internet connection. Enjoy this hunting app in all tough to reach places! \n\nWhat people say: ...I literally use this calendar on a weekly basis as I grew up on hunting up in upstate New York! This app saves me a huge headache of having to google events and hunting seasons all the time. I simply go on and see which species is \"hunt-able\" during this time of the year and I get my gear and go hunting! Very simple to use UI making it easy to have some joy in life!\n\nMuch more screenshots: \nwww.LifewareSolutions.com\n\nVideo:\nhttp://youtu.be/WWPykvtVvJM\n\nIf you like Hunting Aid, please write us a review on iTunes to keep free updates coming.

Use Radar HD to see what weather is coming your way!  \n\nRadar shows areas of current precipitation or future simulated radar prediction!. A weather radar is used to locate precipitation, calculate its motion, estimate its type (rain, snow, hail, etc.), and forecast its future position and intensity.  Precipitation type is indicated by the color. Green color indicates lesser precipitation while the yellow color code indicates intense precipitations. The color code red is indicative of the most intense precipitations. Blue color indicates snow.\n\nUsing the data from Storm Prediction Center and Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (SPC & GDAC) Radar HD provides information about tropical storms and hurricanes for locations worldwide, areas affected by storms and severe weather, coordinates and wind speed, storm tracks & path projections.\n\nSatellite images provide an excellent view on the clouds in the sky and an indication of the weather over the United states, Europe, Japan, Australia and Indonesia.\nSatellite images come from satellites which remain above a fixed point on the Earth (i.e. they are “geostationary”). Lighter areas of cloud show where the cloud tops are cooler and therefore where weather features like fronts and shower clouds are.\n\nThe app also allows you to check the weather on your favorite places on maps.

This app lets you determine what levels of radiation are being reported at various locations around the world. You can scroll around the map and zoom in on readings. Readings are continuously updated every few minutes. \n\nIt displays the current ionizing radiation reading from these detectors on an easy to use world map, in uR/hr, one of the standard units of measurement for radiation. You can scroll around and zoom in to your area. Typical background (naturally occurring) radiation values near sea level are in the 10 to 20 uR/hr range. Higher readings naturally occur at higher elevations due to cosmic rays from outer space.\n\nTapping on one of the readings will bring up a chart of the last few days worth of readings. You can even smooth out the variations by adjusting the number of samples averaged per plotted point, to bring out subtle variations. \n\nBuy a copy of Radiation Map Tracker, and you'll never be in the dark about nuclear radiation levels again."

Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

      "label": "One of the easiest ways to become a happier person is to experience more sunlight every day. Skylight can help make that happen through a beautiful app experience designed for everyone.\n\nCreate a routine around sunrise every morning. Remind yourself to step out at solar noon for a sun break. Take better photos by shooting during Golden Hour. Start getting outside to see the sunset more. Gain a better sense of sunlight lost and gained through the seasons and adjust your routine to make sure you get enough light. Motivate yourself through the winter months by reminding yourself that days are getting longer. The uses are endless but the goal is the same - better living through more sunlight.\n\nSkylight includes a universal app for iPad and iPhone, an Apple Watch app with complications, and three widgets. The Apple Watch complications show you how much sunlight is left in the day, or when upcoming events like Golden Hour are taking place. The complications are a beautiful addition to the watch face and offer one of the most effective ways to use the app. The Today Widget shows you the app information in a quick, glanceable form, so daylight info is always at your fingertips, either in your Today view or with a 3D Touch on the app icon.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Beautiful fluid visual display showing the position of the sun over time.\n- Comprehensive notifications & alarms for daily and yearly sun events.\n- Three different configurable widgets: Year Graph, Daylight Graph, and Gradient.\n- Apple Watch app and complications with daylight clock and events.\n- Year view, showing the entire year's daily sun events with a simple drag of your finger.\n- Detailed event views, describing each sun event and showing the earliest and latest. dates on which it occurs.\n- Date picker to see sun information from dates in the past or future.\n- Location picker to see sun events and graphs for anywhere on earth.\n- Multiple time modes, including specialized modes for photography and science.\n- Support for all display sizes and device orientations.\n- Spotlight support, so you can just type \"Golden Hour\" from your phone's home screen to pull up today's info.\n- Skylight can optionally use GPS in the background to ensure notifications are correct even if you change location.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nSkylight is an indie app developed by the creators of Magic Window. We strive to make beautiful software that connects people with the world. If you have any issues or questions please contact us at support@jetsoncreative.com."

WeatherFX is an app that can retrieve temperature, barometric pressure and relative humidity based on the iPhone/iPad GPS data. The app will also approximate the wet bulb and wet bulb globe (WBGT) temperatures from the retrieved values. Please note that the WBGT is just an estimate. The estimate does not account for wind or low light conditions. The estimate is based on a moderate amount of sunlight. True WBGT can only be acquired through WBGT instrumentation. \n  Once you accept the prompt to acquire the GPS position, the Latitude and Longitude labels will be populated. Click the “Update” button and the app will populate the temperature, pressure and humidity text fields based the closest weather Station ID to your position. The app will then calculate the wet bulb and WBGT temperatures. You'll also notice that the WeatherFX app will place the location name and time of the reading at the top of the screen. This way you will know if the readings are in your location and timely. \n  Besides acquiring the weather from GPS you may get your own estimates for wet bulb and WBGT temperatures by typing temperature, pressure and humidity into the respective text fields. Click the “Manual” segmented button, enter the white fields followed by clicking the “Update” button. \n  The app will also compute random numbers for temperature, pressure and humidity clicking the \"Shake\" segmented button.  The device may be shaken and new settings will populate the fields.  Click update button and the random wet bulb and WBGT temperatures will be computed.  \nAfter an update has been executed, you may use WeatherFX to quickly convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa by clicking the desired “°F” or \"°C” segmented buttons. Barometric pressure may be converted from inches mercury to millibars and vice versa by clicking the desired “in” or “mBar” segmented buttons. \nAfter an update you will be presented with a flag condition button on the bottom left of the screen. The flag condition is derived from the WBGT estimate. If the flag condition is not “NONE”, you may click on the condition to yield work to rest ratios and water consumption given the current estimated flag condition. These figures are posted as a quick and portable reference only. Guidance for these figures are acquired from the U.S. Marine Corps Order 6200.1E dated June, 2002. You are strongly advised to read the complete guidance to know what each entry means."

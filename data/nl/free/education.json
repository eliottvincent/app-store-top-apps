      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

Het dataverkeer dat nodig is voor het streamen van video’s, en het offline beschikbaar maken van spelletjes en tekeningen  kan echter tot extra kosten leiden. Standaard kun je daarom alleen downloaden of streamen wanneer je toestel verbonden is met Wifi. In het oudermenu kun indien gewenst aangeven dat je ook wil downloaden en streamen als je toestel niet verbonden is met Wifi.\n- Mijn lievelingsprogramma staat er niet in: Programma’s zijn vanwege rechten beperkt beschikbaar in de app.\n- Vol geheugen: De app slaat de spelletjes en knutsels op, zodat je ze ook zonder internet kunt bekijken. Mocht het geheugen van je telefoon of tablet hierdoor vollopen, ga dan naar het oudermenu en wis het geheugen.\n- App niet beschikbaar buiten Nederland: Zappelin heeft helaas geen rechten om de filmpjes in het buitenland aan te bieden. De NPO Zappelin-app is daarom alleen beschikbaar voor Nederlandse accounts.\n- Updaten app onmogelijk: De Zappelin app is geschikt voor de laatste drie iOS versies.\n- Vragen over of problemen met de app: mail naar post@npozappelin.nl voor support. Vragen die bij de recensies staan kunnen we helaas niet beantwoorden, omdat die mailadressen niet beschikbaar zijn voor ons."

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Je krijgt willekeurige kruispunten met verkeersdeelnemers te zien en jij moet aangeven in welke volgorde de verkeersdeelnemers verder mogen.\n\nOnderaan in het scherm staan een aantal cirkels met een cijfer. De bedoeling is dat je de cirkel met het cijfer 1 op de verkeersdeelnemer sleept die het eerste mag en het volgende cijfer op de de deelnemer die daarna mag. Als je alle cirkels op de plek hebt gesleept krijg je te zien of je het goed had of niet.\n\nWeet je het even niet? Raak dan de verkeersdeelnemer aan en houd je vinger daar even ingedrukt. Je krijgt dan een tip.\n\nDe wijze van beantwoorden komt exact overeen met de sleepvraag in het officiële CBR theorie-examen (vanaf 1 januari 2017)."

Daan vertelt je stap voor stap wat er is gebeurd op de plaats waar je op dat moment staat. Hoe de bewoners van toen die gebeurtenissen hebben beleefd. En de gevolgen daarvan voor ons land zoals wij het nu kennen. \n\nStop je telefoon in je zak en haal ‘m er pas weer uit aan het eind van de route. Daan weet precies waar je bent en vertelt waar je naartoe moet en waar je moet kijken. Zo mis je niets van zijn fantastische verhalen uit onze geschiedenis – en de sporen die je nog altijd ziet in het landschap. \n\nDaans verhalen zijn geschikt voor alle leeftijden. En daarmee misschien wel de leukste keus voor een actief en leerzaam dagje weg. Liever eerst een voorproefje voor je op weg gaat? In de app kun je van elke wandeling stukjes beluisteren. Zo weet je precies welke route het best bij je plannen voor de dag past.\n\nCompatibiliteit:\n\nJe downloadt de app en je kunt meteen op pad. Een account heb je niet nodig. Mobiele data ook niet, want je kunt de routes thuis alvast downloaden naar je telefoon. Je gps zorgt voor de rest.  \n\nFunctionaliteiten:\n\nElke wandeling sluit aan op een aflevering van de televisieserie Het verhaal van Nederland. Je kunt de routes gewoon lopen zonder de serie te zien. Wil je toch meer achtergrondinformatie bij de wandeling? Per route vind je een link waarmee je de bijbehorende aflevering kunt zien op NPO Start. \n\nDe app heeft een lijstweergave van alle routes. Zie je het liever op een kaart? De kaartweergave laat je zien welke routes bij jou in de buurt zijn. Of gebruik de ingebouwde suggesties voor je keuze. \n\nHet scherm is zo ontworpen dat je het buiten goed kunt lezen. Ook in de felle zon. Er is ook een dark mode. Die is wat vriendelijker voor de ogen als je ’s avonds thuis door de app navigeert. \n\nBij elke wandeling staat hoelang die duurt. In minuten, maar ook in stappen. Handig voor je wandel- of fitnessapp. \n\nNog niet alles helemaal duidelijk? Geen nood, de app heeft een lijst met meest gestelde vragen. Zo kom je er zeker uit. \n\nOndersteuning:\n\nWe zijn heel benieuwd wat je van de app vindt. Van de wandelingen. Van de verhalen van Daan. Of van het gebruiksgemak. De app heeft een feedback-knop waarmee je ons je mening kunt geven. Zodat wij ’m weer iets beter kunnen maken.

In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core Spanish words, form sentences, learn to speak Spanish phrases and take part in conversations. Fun Spanish lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule? The app works great and dynamically adjusts to your needs.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own Spanish language tutor in your pocket.\nDownload the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the Spanish language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Spanish grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Spanish words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Spanish clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Spanish. Mondly teaches you Spanish vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational Spanish. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Spanish vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Spanish clearly.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Spanish verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these Spanish lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language."

      "label": "Met Rijbewijs heb je alle vragen om je goed op het CBR theorie examen voor te bereiden in één app. Rijbewijs bevat honderden vragen die je in het echte theorie examen kunt verwachten en is daarom het ideale hulpmiddel. \n\n# De nummer 1 App voor het CBR theorie examen!\n\nJe krijgt alle vragen. Deze app is gratis. Geen aankopen in de app nodig. \n\nWAAROM RIJBEWIJS?\n=====================\n\nHETZELFDE OPGEBOUWD ALS DE EXAMENS VAN HET CBR – INCLUSIEF UITLEG \nDe vragen en antwoorden in de Rijbewijs app zijn vergelijkbaar met die van het CBR theorie-examen. Net als in het echte theorie examen komen de thema’s gevaarherkenning, verkeersregels en verkeersinzicht aan bod. Na het beantwoorden van een vraag, krijg je niet alleen de juiste oplossing, maar ook een gedetailleerde uitleg. Een betere App om je voor te bereiden vind je niet!\n\nGEEN ONDUIDELIJKHEDEN: \nElke categorie bevat een groot aantal vragen. De juiste antwoorden worden duidelijk uitgelegd. \n \nDE BESTE VOORBEREIDING: \nGebruik de testmodus om een echt examen te simuleren. De succes-meter laat zien hoeveel je nog moet oefenen om je theorie examen te halen. \n\nWAAR EN WANNEER JE MAAR WIL: \nHet maakt niet uit waar je bent; op school, in de trein, of thuis, met Rijbewijs kun je altijd oefenen. \n\n\nDEEL MET JE VRIENDEN: \nSamen met je vrienden je theorie examen voorbereiden? Laat ze zien hoe goed je bent en deel je resultaten via Facebook en Twitter.\n\nDIT IS WAT JE KRIJGT MET RIJBEWIJS? \n=======================================\n\nLEERMODUS: \nIn de leermodus vind je alle vragen. De vragen zijn onderverdeeld in categorieën zodat je de categorieën die je moeilijk vindt, extra kunt oefenen. \n\nTESTMODUS: \nDe examens in de testmodus zien er net zo uit als de echte theorie examens.  Deze examens duren ongeveer 20-30 minuten en bestaan uit meerkeuzevragen, ja/nee vragen en invulvragen.  Na afloop van het examen zie je meteen of dat je geslaagd bent of niet. De vragen die je fout beantwoord hebt, krijg je samen met de juiste antwoorden en een duidelijke uitleg, meteen te zien zodat je die nog extra kunt oefenen.\n\nSUCCES: \nDe resultaten van elke test die je maakt, worden aan de succes-meter toegevoegd. Deze meter laat zien hoeveel je nog moet oefenen om je theorie examen te halen. \n\nTIPS: \nIn de Rijbewijs App kun je alle belangrijke aanwijzingen, tips en hints terugvinden. In de App vind je ook veel tips om je op het rijexamen zelf voor te bereiden.\n\nHIGHSCORE: \nHeb je een hoge score behaald? Wij houden een lijst met highscores bij, dus stuur ons je resultaten!\n\nDeze App is niet gepubliceerd door het CBR.  Het CBR geeft zelf geen oefenmateriaal uit.\n\nWil je meer over Rijbewijs weten, of heb je een technische vraag?

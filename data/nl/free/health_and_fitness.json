We support plans for many goals: weight loss, maintaining weight, weight gain and building muscle. Eat what you want, but keep an eye on those calories, carbs and fats!\n\nFEATURES\n* Food Database Validated by Expert Nutritionists\n* Add your own foods\n* Save meals and add them instantly next time\n* Nutrition tracking for several goals (e.g. weight loss & muscle building)\n* More than a calorie counter: keep an eye on those carbs, proteins and fats as well\n* Integrated with Virtuagym Fitness for home & gym workouts\n* Health app integration: Sync workouts from other apps, and save your eaten calories, carbs, proteins and fat in the Health app, so other apps can use this data\n\nWHY VIRTUAGYM IS THE BEST\n- Many other nutrition apps or calorie counters don’t have a lot of knowledge about fitness. Therefore, mistakes are being made with calorie tracking. Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises. If you have any suggestions, let us know. If you want to stay updated, get useful fitness tips or if you need motivation: follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPRO SUBSCRIPTION\nTo unlock the full app you can subscribe to our PRO membership. The monthly subscription will automatically renew and your iTunes account will be charged within 24 hours prior to renewal for the same amount as your current monthly subscription fee, if the auto-renew option is not turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.

      "label": "Mijn Eetmeter is een online eetdagboek dat mensen helpt om gezonder te eten. Je krijgt inzicht in je eetpatroon en in de hoeveelheid energie en voedingsstoffen die je binnenkrijgt. Ook krijg je concrete tips hoe je gezonder kan kiezen en volgens de Schijf van Vijf kan eten. Dat kan allemaal ook helpen om af te vallen. \n\nSNEL JE DAGBOEK INVULLEN MET DE BARCODE-SCANNER \nIn de app Mijn Eetmeter kun je de barcodes van producten scannen. Zo voeg je makkelijk en snel producten toe aan jouw dagboek.\n\n90.000 MERKPRODUCTEN \nIn Mijn Eetmeter zitten ruim 90.000 (huis)merkartikelen. \n\nWAT MAAKT MIJN EETMETER UNIEK?\n\n1. Helemaal gratis en zonder commercieel belang\n\nMijn Eetmeter is en blijft gratis. Het Voedingscentrum kan deze app gratis aanbieden omdat wij 100% door de overheid gefinancierd worden om mensen te helpen gezonder te eten. Omdat we geen commercieel belang hebben is onze informatie onafhankelijk en betrouwbaar. We zullen ook nooit je persoonlijke informatie delen met derden.\n\n2. Altijd actueel \n\nMijn Eetmeter is de enige app die de productinformatie direct haalt uit de databanken van fabrikanten. Passen de fabrikanten het etiket aan, dan krijgen wij dus automatisch de meest actuele productgegevens. \n\n3. Voedingswaarde zoals je het eet\n\nScan of selecteer je bijvoorbeeld een pasta, dan wil je natuurlijk de voedingswaarden toevoegen van de gekookte pasta; zo eet je het immers. Staan op het etiket de waarden van de rauwe pasta, dan rekenen wij dit in Mijn Eetmeter voor je om. Of als je groente eet, dan kun je kiezen of je dit rauw of gewokt eet bijvoorbeeld.\n\n4. Advies ook op vitamines en mineralen.\n\nOp het etiket staat hoeveel energie, vet, verzadigd vet, eiwit, koolhydraten, vezels en zout er in het product zit. In Mijn Eetmeter krijg je voor deze voedingsstoffen direct een advies op maat. Maar je kunt in Mijn Eetmeter ook letten op vitamines en mineralen. Wij koppelen namelijk alle producten aan algemene voedingswaarden. Zo kunnen wij je inzicht geven in alle voedingstoffen. \n\n5. Volgens de Schijf van Vijf \n\nMensen die graag meer volgens de Schijf van Vijf willen eten, bieden we een Schijf van Vijf-advies aan. Daarin krijg je te zien hoeveel jij al eet volgens de Schijf van Vijf en krijg je tips hoe je gezonder kunt kiezen.\n\n6.

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix.

Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking.

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Kies bijvoorbeeld voor een week lang gezonder snacken, een cursus cardioboksen (op jouw niveau) of een tweeweekse meditatiecursus.\n\nEr is voor ieder wat wils en we voegen regelmatig nieuwe challenges toe die je helpen jouw doelen te behalen.\n\nStap voor stap\nTijdens een challenge helpen we je stap voor stap om jouw doel te bereiken. Want de gedragswetenschap laat zien dat kleine stapjes de grootste kans op blijvend succes geven. Elke dag krijg je een korte opdracht om die dag op te focussen. Dit maken we zo makkelijk mogelijk met handige filmpjes en artikelen vol tips en inspiratie. Daarnaast sturen we je, als je dat wilt, e-mails en pushberichten om je te motiveren. En bij de challenges rond voeding krijg je iedere dag receptinspiratie om jouw doel te halen.\n\nZo maken we gezond leven voor jou leuker, lekkerder en gemakkelijker!"

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I.

You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

Wandel alleen of samen met vrienden, familie en collega’s. Verdien XP, medailles, badges en spaar de hersenweetjes van hoogleraar neuropsycholoog Erik Scherder. \n  \nOmmetje is ontwikkelt door de Hersenstichting in nauwe samenwerking met Erik Scherder. Laat je door hem inspireren en start vandaag nog met (een) Ommetje!\n \nDit vind en kun je allemaal met de app:\n \nOMMETJE STARTEN EN STOPPEN\nStart en stop je Ommetje met één klik.

Er zijn in totaal 8 levels. Iedere 2 weken loop je samen met 99 willekeurige gebruikers in een level. Iedere 2 weken promoveert de top 30% naar een nieuw level. De laatste 10% van de gebruikers zakken een level. De rest blijft in hetzelfde level. Na verloop van tijd ‘leert’ de app op welk niveau je zit en kom je in een level met mensen van jouw niveau.\n \nHierdoor ontstaat een gezonde competitie die supermotiverend werkt. Dan loop je met plezier dat extra rondje!\n \nWANDELEN IN JE EIGEN TEAM \nWil je liever in een competitie met vrienden of juist rustig samen wandelen met familie, buren of collega's? Dat kan ook!

Volg de instructies van Coach Evy Gruyaert en voor je het weet, loop ook jij 5 km aan één stuk. \n\nWe starten de eerste les met 1 tot 2 minuten joggen afgewisseld met 1 tot 2 minuten wandelen. Je eerste lessen duren 20 minuten en bouwen stelselmatig op naar maximaal 40 minuten in het eerste schema. \n\nHonderdduizenden lopers gingen je voor. Ontdek hun verhalen op onze website www.start2run.app en laat je inspireren. \n\n\n25 TRAININGSSCHEMA'S\n\n\nWe staan voor je klaar om je te begeleiden naar (jouw eerste) 5km, 10 km,  10 miles of misschien wel een (halve) marathon. Wij zorgen ervoor dat jij jouw doel bereikt. De trainingsschema’s in de app zijn opgesteld door ervaren sportcoaches bij Energy Lab. Kies het schema dat bij je past, en coach Evy zal je vertellen wanneer je mag versnellen of vertragen. Het volgen van een schema helpt je om verantwoord op te bouwen waardoor je kans op blessures verkleint. De extra tips die je tijdens de training te horen krijgt, helpen om je loophouding te verbeteren en de juiste keuzes te maken op vlak van voeding & drinken voor, tijdens en na je training. Coach Evy is jouw persoonlijke trainer, jouw digitale loopvriendin die altijd voor je klaar staat om samen te gaan trainen. \n\n\nPERSOONLIJKE AANMOEDIGINGEN\n\nWist je dat coach Evy ook duizenden voornamen insprak, zodat je tijdens de training ook gepersonaliseerde aanmoedigingen kan horen. “Komaan, Sarah, nog even volhouden” of “Ik ben fier op je, Chris”. Ontdek zelf of jouw naam ook reeds beschikbaar is. \n\n\n+500.000 HARDLOPERS\n\nJe staat er niet alleen voor, naast de Hardlopen met Evy app is er ook een actieve Hardlopen met Evy community op facebook en instagram. Wissel ervaringen uit, motiveer elkaar, of vind er het antwoord op al jouw loopvragen.\n\n\nJOUW MUZIEK OF ONZE PLAYLISTS\n\nCombineer jouw trainingen met je favoriete muziek, of laat mij je inspireren via mijn Spotify afspeellijsten. Laat je door de muziek meeslepen en geniet van jouw sportmoment. Misschien ervaar je wel een runner’s high, als je geluk hebt!\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH VERSIE\n\nOok is de Hardlopen met Evy app beschikbaar op Apple Watch en kan de koppeling gemaakt worden met de Gezondheid app van Apple. \nJouw Hardlopen met Evy trainingen kunnen dan ook gesynchroniseerd worden met Apple Gezondheid.\n\n\nABONNEMENT MET GRATIS PROEFPERIODE\n\n\nKrijg toegang tot alle trainingsschema’s via een maand- of jaarabonnement. Als nieuwe klant krijg je een gratis proefversie van 1 week om de app uit te proberen. Je kan dit abonnement starten en beheren via jouw iTunes-account. Je abonnement wordt automatisch verlengd tenzij je het minstens 24u voor het einde van de lopende abonnementsperiode opzegt. De verlenging wordt tijdens deze laatste 24u in rekening gebracht op je account.\n\nOf gebruik de gratis versie van de app om vrije trainingen te registreren en bij te houden in je trainingsdagboek. \n\n\nKIES UIT DEZE STEMMEN \n\n\nBeschikbare stemmen:\n- Evy Gruyaert (NL)\n- Loïc Nottet (FR)\n- Melissa Satta (IT)\n- Sylwina Spiess (DE / GSW) \n\n\n\nZullen we er samen invliegen?\n\n\nHardlopen met Evy voorwaarden: \nhttps://www.hardlopenmetevy.nl/disclaimer/\nHardlopen met Evy website: https://www.hardlopenmetevy.nl"

Leuk toch?\n\nIn de toekomst zal deze app nog verder uitgebreid worden, bijvoorbeeld met ervaringsverhalen van mensen die gestopt zijn. Een beetje naar het voorbeeld van mijn andere app: Alcoholvrijheid. Die app was mijn inspiratie voor deze app, en tegelijkertijd voor duizenden andere mensen om te stoppen met alcohol.\n\nZou deze motiverende aanpak ook helpen met roken? Jij mag het zeggen!"

      "label": "Are you trying to quit smoking? If you are finding it hard to stop smoking, QuitNow is made for you.\n\nFirst things first: you know smoking is bad for your body. Even so, lots of people keep smoking. So why should you quit? When you quit smoking, you improve the quality and length of your life and the lives of the people around you. One way to prepare to successfully launch your smoke-free life is to power up your phone with QuitNow.\n\nQuitNow is a proven app that engages you to quit smoking. It aims to avoid tobacco just by giving you a picture of yourself. Quitting smoking is easier when you focus your effort on these four sections:\n\n- Your ex-smoker status: When you quit smoking, the focus has to be on you. Remember the day you quitted and get the maths: how many days are you free of smoke, how much money you saved, and how many cigarettes you avoided.\n\n- Achievements: your quit smoking motivations: As with all tasks in life, quitting smoking is easier when you divide the task into small and easy ones. So, QuitNow offers you 70 goals based on the cigarettes you avoided, the days since your last cigarette, and the money saved. So, you will start celebrating achievements from the first day.\n\n- Community: the ex-smokers chat: When you quit smoking, you need to stay within the non-smoking areas. QuitNow offers a chat full of people that, like you, said goodbye to tobacco. Spending time with nonsmokers will make your way easier.\n\n- Your ex-smoker health: QuitNow offers a list of health indicators to explain how your body improves day by day. They are based in the World Health Organization ones, and we update them as soon as the W.H.O. does.\n\n\nIn addition, there are more sections in the preferences screen that could help you in your way to quitting smoking.\n\n- Frequent Asked Questions: there are some tips to quit smoking, and honestly, we don’t know where to put them. Most quitters look for tips on the internet, and there are lots of fake tips there. We researched in the World Health Organization archives to find the investigations they made and the conclusions they had. In the Frequent Asked Questions, you will find all the answers to those questions you have about quitting smoking.\n\n- The QuitNow bot: sometimes, you have strange questions that don’t appear in the F.A.Q. In those cases, you can ask the bot: we train her to answer those strange ones. If she doesn’t have a good answer, she will contact the QuitNow crew and they will update their knowledge base, so she will learn the best answers to your questions. By the way, yes: all the bot answers are extracted from the W.H.O. archives, as the F.A.Q. tips.\n\n- Books to quit smoking: knowing some techniques about quitting smoking makes the task easier. There's always someone talking about books in the chat, so we made an investigation to know which are the most popular, and which ones can actually help you to quit smoking for good.\n\n\nDo you have any idea to make QuitNow even better? If so, please do write to us at ios@fewlaps.com\n\nTerms of Service: https://tos.quitnow.app/eula\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://tos.quitnow.app/privacypolicy"

Zo helpen we jou om je goede gewoontes vast te houden.\n\nJe persoonlijke voedingsschema wordt voor je klaar gezet en daarnaast vind je alle tools om hier op een makkelijke manier aan de slag. Zo zijn er 1800+ recepten beschikbaar, kun je eigen maaltijden samenstellen, maaltijden wisselen en direct alle ingrediënten terugvinden op je boodschappenlijst. Zo word jij totaal ontzorgd!\n\nDe aangesloten coaches zorgen ervoor dat jij effectief aan je doelstelling kunt werken op het gebied van afvallen, aankomen en een gezondere levensstijl, zonder dat je een voedingslogboek hoeft bij te houden, calorieën hoeft te tellen of zelf moet bedenken wat er op het menu moet staan.\n\nJouw coach stelt het voedingsschema en je sportprogramma met je in, rekening houdend met jouw doelstelling en voorkeuren. Daarbij kan bijvoorbeeld rekening worden gehouden met het aantal eetmomenten, de macronutriënten verdeling, allergieën, voedingsvoorkeuren, maximale bereidingstijd en koken voor het hele gezin.\n\nVanuit de app kun je overzichtelijk je voortgang volgen in de statistieken en chatten met je coach om vragen te stellen.\n\nProbeer de app en wordt de fitste versie van jezelf met VYTAL!\n\nJe kunt een coach uitkiezen en vrijblijvend een coachverzoek sturen via je profiel bij ‘mijn coach’. De coach zal dan contact met je opnemen om de mogelijkheden te bespreken. Let op: de coach zal een vergoeding vragen voor jouw gebruik van de app en zijn of haar coaching. Deze vergoeding zal per coach verschillen en is afhankelijk van de begeleidingsintensiteit. Vaak biedt een coach meerdere trajecten aan. Overleg dus goed met de coach over waar je naar op zoek bent en wat je van de coach verwacht.\n\nLees meer over onze voorwaarden: https://www.vytal.nl/algemenevoorwaarden.pdf\nLees ons privacybeleid hier: https://www.vytal.nl/privacypolicy.pdf"

      "label": "Met de ‘Kies Ik Gezond?’-app van het Voedingscentrum scan, zoek en vergelijk je eenvoudig producten. In de supermarkt óf thuis op de bank.\n\nMET DE APP: \n1. Vind je gezondere keuzes \n2. Zie je of producten in de Schijf van Vijf staan \n3. Vergelijk je makkelijk producten op voedingswaarden, zoals suiker, vet of zout \n4. Kun je een ingrediënt of allergeen instellen waar je op wilt letten\n5. Kun je letten op vlees of vis\n6. Voeg je producten toe aan Mijn Eetmeter\n\nBARCODE SCANNEN EN ZOEKEN: MAKKELIJK HET ETIKET LEZEN OP JE TELEFOON\nDe kleine lettertjes op het etiket beu? In de app krijg je de voedingswaarden en ingrediënten te zien wanneer je de streepjescode van een product scant. Je kunt ook een product zoeken.\n\nGEZONDER KIEZEN: ALTERNATIEVEN OP EEN RIJ\nStandaard zie je of een product past in de Schijf van Vijf of niet. Bij producten die niet in de Schijf van Vijf passen krijg je gezondere alternatieven te zien. \n\nINGREDIËNTENCHECKER: ALLERGEEN OF INGREDIËNT INSTELLEN\nHeb je een allergie of intolerantie waar je rekening mee wilt houden? Je selecteert eenvoudig dat je wilt letten op gluten, melk, noten, vis of een andere allergeen. \n\nJe kunt ook andere ingrediënten instellen waar je op wilt letten. Denk aan palmolie vanwege het milieu. Of alcohol vanwege je gezondheid of zwangerschap. Je kunt toegevoegde suikers en zout selecteren, handig als je minder suiker of zout wilt eten. Ook als je iets niet lust kun je de checker gebruiken.\n\nLETTEN OP VLEES OF VIS\nWil jij zien of er vlees of vis in een product zit? Of dat het volledig vegetarisch is? Je kunt dit aangeven in je profiel.\n\nJE EIGEN SUPERMARKT: RELEVANTE PRODUCTEN ZIEN\nJe kunt aangeven bij welke supermarkten je boodschappen doet. Dan krijg je de eigenmerken van andere supermarkten niet te zien bij het zoeken naar een product.\n\nLETTEN OP VOEDINGSWAARDEN\nJe kunt aangeven in de app op welke voedingswaarden je extra wilt letten. Het gaat om energie (calorieën), vetten, verzadigde vetten, koolhydraten, suikers, vezels, eiwitten en zout. De voedingswaarden die jij belangrijk vindt komen in de app dan altijd vooraan te staan. Ideaal dus als je bijvoorbeeld minder suiker wilt eten.\n\nPRODUCTEN VERGELIJKEN: EENVOUDIG BEOORDELEN\nMet de Vergelijker in de app kun je eigenschappen van maximaal 3 producten met elkaar vergelijken. Je kunt de voedingswaarden met elkaar vergelijken, bijvoorbeeld de hoeveelheid suiker, zout of vet. Ook kun je zien of de producten in de Schijf van Vijf staan.\n\nSORTEREN: DE GEZONDERE KEUZE BOVENAAN\nAls je een product zoekt, kun je de zoekresultaten sorteren op voedingswaarden. Zo zie je makkelijk in welk product bijvoorbeeld het minste suiker zit. Daarnaast kun je ook sorteren op alfabet of relevantie.\n\nFILTEREN: ALLEEN ZIEN WAT JIJ ZOEKT\nAls je een product zoekt, kun je de zoekresultaten filteren. Je kunt filteren op Schijf van Vijf, supermarkten, merken, productcategorieën en ingrediënten. Als je bijvoorbeeld op Schijf van Vijf filtert, dan krijg je alleen de producten te zien die in de Schijf van Vijf staan.\n\nFAVORIETEN MAKEN\nZoek je sommige producten wel erg vaak op? Maak ze favoriet en je vindt ze altijd snel weer terug.\n\nKOPPELING MET MIJN EETMETER: PRODUCTEN TOEVOEGEN\nGebruik je Mijn Eetmeter en heb je deze als app op je telefoon, dan kun je heel gemakkelijk jouw product toevoegen aan je eetdagboek."

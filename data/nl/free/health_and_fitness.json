We support plans for many goals: weight loss, maintaining weight, weight gain and building muscle. Eat what you want, but keep an eye on those calories, carbs and fats!\n\nFEATURES\n* Food Database Validated by Expert Nutritionists\n* Add your own foods\n* Save meals and add them instantly next time\n* Nutrition tracking for several goals (e.g. weight loss & muscle building)\n* More than a calorie counter: keep an eye on those carbs, proteins and fats as well\n* Integrated with Virtuagym Fitness for home & gym workouts\n* Health app integration: Sync workouts from other apps, and save your eaten calories, carbs, proteins and fat in the Health app, so other apps can use this data\n\nWHY VIRTUAGYM IS THE BEST\n- Many other nutrition apps or calorie counters don’t have a lot of knowledge about fitness. Therefore, mistakes are being made with calorie tracking. Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises. If you have any suggestions, let us know. If you want to stay updated, get useful fitness tips or if you need motivation: follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPRO SUBSCRIPTION\nTo unlock the full app you can subscribe to our PRO membership. The monthly subscription will automatically renew and your iTunes account will be charged within 24 hours prior to renewal for the same amount as your current monthly subscription fee, if the auto-renew option is not turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.

      "label": "Mijn Eetmeter is een online eetdagboek dat mensen helpt om gezonder te eten. Je krijgt inzicht in je eetpatroon en in de hoeveelheid energie en voedingsstoffen die je binnenkrijgt. Ook krijg je concrete tips hoe je gezonder kan kiezen en volgens de Schijf van Vijf kan eten. Dat kan allemaal ook helpen om af te vallen. \n\nSNEL JE DAGBOEK INVULLEN MET DE BARCODE-SCANNER \nIn de app Mijn Eetmeter kun je de barcodes van producten scannen. Zo voeg je makkelijk en snel producten toe aan jouw dagboek.\n\n90.000 MERKPRODUCTEN \nIn Mijn Eetmeter zitten ruim 90.000 (huis)merkartikelen. \n\nWAT MAAKT MIJN EETMETER UNIEK?\n\n1. Helemaal gratis en zonder commercieel belang\n\nMijn Eetmeter is en blijft gratis. Het Voedingscentrum kan deze app gratis aanbieden omdat wij 100% door de overheid gefinancierd worden om mensen te helpen gezonder te eten. Omdat we geen commercieel belang hebben is onze informatie onafhankelijk en betrouwbaar. We zullen ook nooit je persoonlijke informatie delen met derden.\n\n2. Altijd actueel \n\nMijn Eetmeter is de enige app die de productinformatie direct haalt uit de databanken van fabrikanten. Passen de fabrikanten het etiket aan, dan krijgen wij dus automatisch de meest actuele productgegevens. \n\n3. Voedingswaarde zoals je het eet\n\nScan of selecteer je bijvoorbeeld een pasta, dan wil je natuurlijk de voedingswaarden toevoegen van de gekookte pasta; zo eet je het immers. Staan op het etiket de waarden van de rauwe pasta, dan rekenen wij dit in Mijn Eetmeter voor je om. Of als je groente eet, dan kun je kiezen of je dit rauw of gewokt eet bijvoorbeeld.\n\n4. Advies ook op vitamines en mineralen.\n\nOp het etiket staat hoeveel energie, vet, verzadigd vet, eiwit, koolhydraten, vezels en zout er in het product zit. In Mijn Eetmeter krijg je voor deze voedingsstoffen direct een advies op maat. Maar je kunt in Mijn Eetmeter ook letten op vitamines en mineralen. Wij koppelen namelijk alle producten aan algemene voedingswaarden. Zo kunnen wij je inzicht geven in alle voedingstoffen. \n\n5. Volgens de Schijf van Vijf \n\nMensen die graag meer volgens de Schijf van Vijf willen eten, bieden we een Schijf van Vijf-advies aan. Daarin krijg je te zien hoeveel jij al eet volgens de Schijf van Vijf en krijg je tips hoe je gezonder kunt kiezen.\n\n6. Link met de app ‘Kies ik Gezond?’\n\nGebruikers van onze ‘Kies ik Gezond?’-app kunnen producten vanuit die app favoriet maken in Mijn Eetmeter. In deze app zie je per product of het gezond is.\n\nAFVALLEN\nVeel van de gebruikers van Mijn Eetmeter gebruiken het als hulp bij afvallen. Mijn Eetmeter helpt je bewust te maken welke producten veel calorieën leveren en je kunt eenvoudig bijhouden hoeveel je eet.\n\nBMI BIJHOUDEN\nIn Mijn Eetmeter kun je bijhouden hoe je gewicht zich ontwikkelt. Daarvoor vul je regelmatig je gewicht in. Je ziet dan in een grafiek hoeveel je aankomt of afvalt. \n\nBEWEEGMETER\nGenoeg bewegen hoort bij een gezonde leefstijl, net als gezond eten. Als je wilt kun je daarom ook bijhouden hoeveel je beweegt en of dit genoeg is om de norm voor beweging te halen.\n\nMIJN VOEDINGSCENTRUM\nMijn Eetmeter wisselt gegevens uit met de website www.mijnvoedingscentrum.nl. Op deze website kun je met dezelfde gegevens inloggen als met Mijn Eetmeter. Je vindt daar nog meer handige tools. Ook kun je je dagboek en de resultaten downloaden en printen.\n\nSUCCES\nOndertussen is de app al ruim een miljoen keer gedownload en kent vele enthousiaste gebruikers, zoals Elly: “Het gaf inzicht. Bij sommige dingen dacht ik: jee, zoveel calorieën, of zoveel suiker of vet. Je weet het wel, maar je schrikt toch als je die getallen ziet.”"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Je ontwikkelt zo gezonde gewoontes die passen bij jouw dagelijkse routine. De Actify-app zit vol recepten, workouts en meditaties die je helpen bij het werken aan je gezondheid en vitaliteit. Je voelt je gezonder en energieker door meer te ontspannen en beter te slapen, gezonder te eten of meer te bewegen. Zonder dat je op dieet of naar de sportschool hoeft!  \r\nDoor kleine stappen regelmatig te herhalen leert Actify je wennen aan nieuwe gewoontes, zodat ze net als tandenpoetsen vanzelf een onderdeel worden van je dagelijkse routine. En met Actify als coach heb je alles wat je nodig hebt binnen handbereik. Dankzij de praktische tips, workouts, recepten, coachsessies en mindfulness meditaties ontwikkel je een gezonde leefstijl die bij jou past.  \r\nGa met Actify op je eigen tempo aan de slag met jouw doel. Wil je ontspannen en beter slapen, meer bewegen of gezonder eten? Na de keuze voor een doel geeft jouw coach je suggesties voor nieuwe gewoontes. Alle gewoontes in de Actify-app zijn ontwikkeld op basis van wetenschappelijke inzichten. Wist je dat uit onderzoek blijkt dat gezonder leven makkelijker en leuker wordt als je kleine stappen zet? De kracht zit daarnaast in de herhaling. Hoe vaker je iets doet, hoe meer het vanzelf gaat. En een gezonde leefstijl die past in jouw dagelijkse routine werkt beter dan het volgen van een dieet of af en toe een sportschoolbezoek. In kleine stappen naar je gezonde gewoontes levert bovendien een duurzaam resultaat op!  "

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

In twaalf duidelijke stappen begeleidt de app je bij het reanimeren. Hiermee kun je in een stressvolle situatie correct medisch handelen. De instructie kan op elk moment gepauzeerd wordt.

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved.

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "Met de ‘Kies Ik Gezond?’-app van het Voedingscentrum scan, zoek en vergelijk je eenvoudig producten. In de supermarkt óf thuis op de bank.\n\nMET DE APP: \n1. Vind je gezondere keuzes \n2. Zie je of producten in de Schijf van Vijf staan \n3. Vergelijk je makkelijk producten op voedingswaarden, zoals suiker, vet of zout \n4. Kun je een ingrediënt of allergeen instellen waar je op wilt letten\n5. Kun je letten op vlees of vis\n6. Voeg je producten toe aan Mijn Eetmeter\n\nBARCODE SCANNEN EN ZOEKEN: MAKKELIJK HET ETIKET LEZEN OP JE TELEFOON\nDe kleine lettertjes op het etiket beu? In de app krijg je de voedingswaarden en ingrediënten te zien wanneer je de streepjescode van een product scant. Je kunt ook een product zoeken.\n\nGEZONDER KIEZEN: ALTERNATIEVEN OP EEN RIJ\nStandaard zie je of een product past in de Schijf van Vijf of niet. Bij producten die niet in de Schijf van Vijf passen krijg je gezondere alternatieven te zien. \n\nINGREDIËNTENCHECKER: ALLERGEEN OF INGREDIËNT INSTELLEN\nHeb je een allergie of intolerantie waar je rekening mee wilt houden? Je selecteert eenvoudig dat je wilt letten op gluten, melk, noten, vis of een andere allergeen. \n\nJe kunt ook andere ingrediënten instellen waar je op wilt letten. Denk aan palmolie vanwege het milieu. Of alcohol vanwege je gezondheid of zwangerschap. Je kunt toegevoegde suikers en zout selecteren, handig als je minder suiker of zout wilt eten. Ook als je iets niet lust kun je de checker gebruiken.\n\nLETTEN OP VLEES OF VIS\nWil jij zien of er vlees of vis in een product zit? Of dat het volledig vegetarisch is? Je kunt dit aangeven in je profiel.\n\nJE EIGEN SUPERMARKT: RELEVANTE PRODUCTEN ZIEN\nJe kunt aangeven bij welke supermarkten je boodschappen doet. Dan krijg je de eigenmerken van andere supermarkten niet te zien bij het zoeken naar een product.\n\nLETTEN OP VOEDINGSWAARDEN\nJe kunt aangeven in de app op welke voedingswaarden je extra wilt letten. Het gaat om energie (calorieën), vetten, verzadigde vetten, koolhydraten, suikers, vezels, eiwitten en zout. De voedingswaarden die jij belangrijk vindt komen in de app dan altijd vooraan te staan. Ideaal dus als je bijvoorbeeld minder suiker wilt eten.\n\nPRODUCTEN VERGELIJKEN: EENVOUDIG BEOORDELEN\nMet de Vergelijker in de app kun je eigenschappen van maximaal 3 producten met elkaar vergelijken. Je kunt de voedingswaarden met elkaar vergelijken, bijvoorbeeld de hoeveelheid suiker, zout of vet. Ook kun je zien of de producten in de Schijf van Vijf staan.\n\nSORTEREN: DE GEZONDERE KEUZE BOVENAAN\nAls je een product zoekt, kun je de zoekresultaten sorteren op voedingswaarden. Zo zie je makkelijk in welk product bijvoorbeeld het minste suiker zit. Daarnaast kun je ook sorteren op alfabet of relevantie.\n\nFILTEREN: ALLEEN ZIEN WAT JIJ ZOEKT\nAls je een product zoekt, kun je de zoekresultaten filteren. Je kunt filteren op Schijf van Vijf, supermarkten, merken, productcategorieën en ingrediënten. Als je bijvoorbeeld op Schijf van Vijf filtert, dan krijg je alleen de producten te zien die in de Schijf van Vijf staan.\n\nFAVORIETEN MAKEN\nZoek je sommige producten wel erg vaak op? Maak ze favoriet en je vindt ze altijd snel weer terug.\n\nKOPPELING MET MIJN EETMETER: PRODUCTEN TOEVOEGEN\nGebruik je Mijn Eetmeter en heb je deze als app op je telefoon, dan kun je heel gemakkelijk jouw product toevoegen aan je eetdagboek."

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

Zo helpen we jou om je goede gewoontes vast te houden.\n\nJe persoonlijke voedingsschema wordt voor je klaar gezet en daarnaast vind je alle tools om hier op een makkelijke manier aan de slag. Zo zijn er 1800+ recepten beschikbaar, kun je eigen maaltijden samenstellen, maaltijden wisselen en direct alle ingrediënten terugvinden op je boodschappenlijst. Zo word jij totaal ontzorgd!\n\nDe aangesloten coaches zorgen ervoor dat jij effectief aan je doelstelling kunt werken op het gebied van afvallen, aankomen en een gezondere levensstijl, zonder dat je een voedingslogboek hoeft bij te houden, calorieën hoeft te tellen of zelf moet bedenken wat er op het menu moet staan.\n\nJouw coach stelt het voedingsschema en je sportprogramma met je in, rekening houdend met jouw doelstelling en voorkeuren. Daarbij kan bijvoorbeeld rekening worden gehouden met het aantal eetmomenten, de macronutriënten verdeling, allergieën, voedingsvoorkeuren, maximale bereidingstijd en koken voor het hele gezin.\n\nVanuit de app kun je overzichtelijk je voortgang volgen in de statistieken en chatten met je coach om vragen te stellen.\n\nProbeer de app en wordt de fitste versie van jezelf met VYTAL!\n\nJe kunt een coach uitkiezen en vrijblijvend een coachverzoek sturen via je profiel bij ‘mijn coach’. De coach zal dan contact met je opnemen om de mogelijkheden te bespreken. Let op: de coach zal een vergoeding vragen voor jouw gebruik van de app en zijn of haar coaching. Deze vergoeding zal per coach verschillen en is afhankelijk van de begeleidingsintensiteit. Vaak biedt een coach meerdere trajecten aan. Overleg dus goed met de coach over waar je naar op zoek bent en wat je van de coach verwacht.\n\nLees meer over onze voorwaarden: https://www.vytal.nl/algemenevoorwaarden.pdf\nLees ons privacybeleid hier: https://www.vytal.nl/privacypolicy.pdf"

      "label": "Mijn Eetmeter is een online eetdagboek dat mensen helpt om gezonder te eten. Je krijgt inzicht in je eetpatroon en in de hoeveelheid energie en voedingsstoffen die je binnenkrijgt. Ook krijg je concrete tips hoe je gezonder kan kiezen en volgens de Schijf van Vijf kan eten. Dat kan allemaal ook helpen om af te vallen. \n\nSNEL JE DAGBOEK INVULLEN MET DE BARCODE-SCANNER \nIn de app Mijn Eetmeter kun je de barcodes van producten scannen. Zo voeg je makkelijk en snel producten toe aan jouw dagboek.\n\n90.000 MERKPRODUCTEN \nIn Mijn Eetmeter zitten ruim 90.000 (huis)merkartikelen. \n\nWAT MAAKT MIJN EETMETER UNIEK?\n\n1. Helemaal gratis en zonder commercieel belang\n\nMijn Eetmeter is en blijft gratis. Het Voedingscentrum kan deze app gratis aanbieden omdat wij 100% door de overheid gefinancierd worden om mensen te helpen gezonder te eten. Omdat we geen commercieel belang hebben is onze informatie onafhankelijk en betrouwbaar. We zullen ook nooit je persoonlijke informatie delen met derden.\n\n2. Altijd actueel \n\nMijn Eetmeter is de enige app die de productinformatie direct haalt uit de databanken van fabrikanten. Passen de fabrikanten het etiket aan, dan krijgen wij dus automatisch de meest actuele productgegevens. \n\n3. Voedingswaarde zoals je het eet\n\nScan of selecteer je bijvoorbeeld een pasta, dan wil je natuurlijk de voedingswaarden toevoegen van de gekookte pasta; zo eet je het immers. Staan op het etiket de waarden van de rauwe pasta, dan rekenen wij dit in Mijn Eetmeter voor je om. Of als je groente eet, dan kun je kiezen of je dit rauw of gewokt eet bijvoorbeeld.\n\n4. Advies ook op vitamines en mineralen.\n\nOp het etiket staat hoeveel energie, vet, verzadigd vet, eiwit, koolhydraten, vezels en zout er in het product zit. In Mijn Eetmeter krijg je voor deze voedingsstoffen direct een advies op maat. Maar je kunt in Mijn Eetmeter ook letten op vitamines en mineralen. Wij koppelen namelijk alle producten aan algemene voedingswaarden. Zo kunnen wij je inzicht geven in alle voedingstoffen. \n\n5. Volgens de Schijf van Vijf \n\nMensen die graag meer volgens de Schijf van Vijf willen eten, bieden we een Schijf van Vijf-advies aan. Daarin krijg je te zien hoeveel jij al eet volgens de Schijf van Vijf en krijg je tips hoe je gezonder kunt kiezen.\n\n6. Link met de app ‘Kies ik Gezond?’\n\nGebruikers van onze ‘Kies ik Gezond?’-app kunnen producten vanuit die app favoriet maken in Mijn Eetmeter. In deze app zie je per product of het gezond is.\n\nAFVALLEN\nVeel van de gebruikers van Mijn Eetmeter gebruiken het als hulp bij afvallen. Mijn Eetmeter helpt je bewust te maken welke producten veel calorieën leveren en je kunt eenvoudig bijhouden hoeveel je eet.\n\nBMI BIJHOUDEN\nIn Mijn Eetmeter kun je bijhouden hoe je gewicht zich ontwikkelt. Daarvoor vul je regelmatig je gewicht in. Je ziet dan in een grafiek hoeveel je aankomt of afvalt. \n\nBEWEEGMETER\nGenoeg bewegen hoort bij een gezonde leefstijl, net als gezond eten. Als je wilt kun je daarom ook bijhouden hoeveel je beweegt en of dit genoeg is om de norm voor beweging te halen.\n\nMIJN VOEDINGSCENTRUM\nMijn Eetmeter wisselt gegevens uit met de website www.mijnvoedingscentrum.nl. Op deze website kun je met dezelfde gegevens inloggen als met Mijn Eetmeter. Je vindt daar nog meer handige tools. Ook kun je je dagboek en de resultaten downloaden en printen.\n\nSUCCES\nOndertussen is de app al ruim een miljoen keer gedownload en kent vele enthousiaste gebruikers, zoals Elly: “Het gaf inzicht. Bij sommige dingen dacht ik: jee, zoveel calorieën, of zoveel suiker of vet. Je weet het wel, maar je schrikt toch als je die getallen ziet.”"

We support plans for many goals: weight loss, maintaining weight, weight gain and building muscle. Eat what you want, but keep an eye on those calories, carbs and fats!\n\nFEATURES\n* Food Database Validated by Expert Nutritionists\n* Add your own foods\n* Save meals and add them instantly next time\n* Nutrition tracking for several goals (e.g. weight loss & muscle building)\n* More than a calorie counter: keep an eye on those carbs, proteins and fats as well\n* Integrated with Virtuagym Fitness for home & gym workouts\n* Health app integration: Sync workouts from other apps, and save your eaten calories, carbs, proteins and fat in the Health app, so other apps can use this data\n\nWHY VIRTUAGYM IS THE BEST\n- Many other nutrition apps or calorie counters don’t have a lot of knowledge about fitness. Therefore, mistakes are being made with calorie tracking. Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises.

Er zijn gesproken instructies bij noodgevallen zoals bewusteloosheid, brandwonden en reanimeren. Daarnaast vind je geschreven instructies over meer dan 80 situaties waarbij EHBO noodzakelijk is, zoals hyperventilatie, wespensteken of een bloedneus.\n\n\nGeen ziekenhuis, wel EHBO\nDe app is vooral bedoeld voor noodgevallen waarbij niet direct medische hulp van een arts nodig is, maar waarbij EHBO nodig is. Per ongeval of situatie geven we aan hoe je de situatie herkent. Daarna leggen we in overzichtelijke stappen uit wat je zelf kan doen. Uiteraard geven we ook aan wanneer het verstandig is om toch contact op te nemen met de huisarts of de huisartsenpost, of om 112 te bellen. \n\n\nGesproken instructies: reanimeren \nVoor reanimeren biedt de app een gesproken instructie. In twaalf duidelijke stappen begeleidt de app je bij het reanimeren. Hiermee kun je in een stressvolle situatie correct medisch handelen. De instructie kan op elk moment gepauzeerd wordt. Ook is het mogelijk om vanuit het instructiemenu direct 112 te bellen. \n\nLet op: De app geeft niet aan waar AED’s hangen.\n\n\nGesproken instructies: brandwonden\nBij brandwonden begeleiden we je in vier eenvoudige stappen rondom koelen, het verwijderen van kleding en het afdekken van de brandwonden. We geven aan wanneer 112 gebeld moet worden bij brandwonden en bieden je de mogelijkheid om dat meteen vanuit de app te doen. Ook voor bewusteloosheid, hevige bloedingen vergiftiging en ernstige verslikking is er een gesproken instructie.\n\n\nMeer voor je gezondheid: EHBO-producten en -cursussen\nIn de app vind je een link naar de webshop van het Nederlandse Rode Kruis. Hier vind je verschillende EHBO-producten en cursussen. De EHBO-cursussen zijn gericht op verschillende situaties (sport, outdoor, in- en om het huis) en/of verschillende doelgroepen (baby’s, kinderen of volwassen).\n\n\nHet Nederlandse Rode Kruis\nHet Rode Kruis staat voor hulp aan mensen in nood. Dichtbij als je je enkel verzwikt tijdens een hardloopwedstrijd, maar ook ver weg. Via 197 afdelingen bieden we hulp, bijvoorbeeld bij evenementen en bij rampen. Het Nederlandse Rode Kruis maakt deel uit van het Internationale Rode Kruis- en de Rode Halve Maanbeweging. Met de EHBO-app willen wij bijdragen aan ons doel: hulp bieden aan mensen in nood."

      "label": "Met de ‘Kies Ik Gezond?’-app van het Voedingscentrum scan, zoek en vergelijk je eenvoudig producten. In de supermarkt óf thuis op de bank.\n\nMET DE APP: \n1. Vind je gezondere keuzes \n2. Zie je of producten in de Schijf van Vijf staan \n3. Vergelijk je makkelijk producten op voedingswaarden, zoals suiker, vet of zout \n4. Kun je een ingrediënt of allergeen instellen waar je op wilt letten\n5. Kun je letten op vlees of vis\n6. Voeg je producten toe aan Mijn Eetmeter\n\nBARCODE SCANNEN EN ZOEKEN: MAKKELIJK HET ETIKET LEZEN OP JE TELEFOON\nDe kleine lettertjes op het etiket beu? In de app krijg je de voedingswaarden en ingrediënten te zien wanneer je de streepjescode van een product scant. Je kunt ook een product zoeken.\n\nGEZONDER KIEZEN: ALTERNATIEVEN OP EEN RIJ\nStandaard zie je of een product past in de Schijf van Vijf of niet. Bij producten die niet in de Schijf van Vijf passen krijg je gezondere alternatieven te zien. \n\nINGREDIËNTENCHECKER: ALLERGEEN OF INGREDIËNT INSTELLEN\nHeb je een allergie of intolerantie waar je rekening mee wilt houden? Je selecteert eenvoudig dat je wilt letten op gluten, melk, noten, vis of een andere allergeen. \n\nJe kunt ook andere ingrediënten instellen waar je op wilt letten. Denk aan palmolie vanwege het milieu. Of alcohol vanwege je gezondheid of zwangerschap. Je kunt toegevoegde suikers en zout selecteren, handig als je minder suiker of zout wilt eten. Ook als je iets niet lust kun je de checker gebruiken.\n\nLETTEN OP VLEES OF VIS\nWil jij zien of er vlees of vis in een product zit? Of dat het volledig vegetarisch is? Je kunt dit aangeven in je profiel.\n\nJE EIGEN SUPERMARKT: RELEVANTE PRODUCTEN ZIEN\nJe kunt aangeven bij welke supermarkten je boodschappen doet. Dan krijg je de eigenmerken van andere supermarkten niet te zien bij het zoeken naar een product.\n\nLETTEN OP VOEDINGSWAARDEN\nJe kunt aangeven in de app op welke voedingswaarden je extra wilt letten. Het gaat om energie (calorieën), vetten, verzadigde vetten, koolhydraten, suikers, vezels, eiwitten en zout. De voedingswaarden die jij belangrijk vindt komen in de app dan altijd vooraan te staan. Ideaal dus als je bijvoorbeeld minder suiker wilt eten.\n\nPRODUCTEN VERGELIJKEN: EENVOUDIG BEOORDELEN\nMet de Vergelijker in de app kun je eigenschappen van maximaal 3 producten met elkaar vergelijken. Je kunt de voedingswaarden met elkaar vergelijken, bijvoorbeeld de hoeveelheid suiker, zout of vet. Ook kun je zien of de producten in de Schijf van Vijf staan.\n\nSORTEREN: DE GEZONDERE KEUZE BOVENAAN\nAls je een product zoekt, kun je de zoekresultaten sorteren op voedingswaarden. Zo zie je makkelijk in welk product bijvoorbeeld het minste suiker zit. Daarnaast kun je ook sorteren op alfabet of relevantie.\n\nFILTEREN: ALLEEN ZIEN WAT JIJ ZOEKT\nAls je een product zoekt, kun je de zoekresultaten filteren. Je kunt filteren op Schijf van Vijf, supermarkten, merken, productcategorieën en ingrediënten. Als je bijvoorbeeld op Schijf van Vijf filtert, dan krijg je alleen de producten te zien die in de Schijf van Vijf staan.\n\nFAVORIETEN MAKEN\nZoek je sommige producten wel erg vaak op? Maak ze favoriet en je vindt ze altijd snel weer terug.\n\nKOPPELING MET MIJN EETMETER: PRODUCTEN TOEVOEGEN\nGebruik je Mijn Eetmeter en heb je deze als app op je telefoon, dan kun je heel gemakkelijk jouw product toevoegen aan je eetdagboek."

Je staat er dus niet alleen voor!\n\nDoelen\nAfhankelijk van jouw persoonlijke motivatie, kies je doelen om aan te werken. Bijvoorbeeld meer gaan bewegen, gezonder eten of vaker ontspannen. Vervolgens kies je een bijpassende challenge, een mini-veranderprogramma: in korte tijd ga je intensief aan de slag om een bepaald deel van jouw leefstijl te verbeteren. Kies bijvoorbeeld voor een week lang gezonder snacken, een cursus cardioboksen (op jouw niveau) of een tweeweekse meditatiecursus.\n\nEr is voor ieder wat wils en we voegen regelmatig nieuwe challenges toe die je helpen jouw doelen te behalen.\n\nStap voor stap\nTijdens een challenge helpen we je stap voor stap om jouw doel te bereiken. Want de gedragswetenschap laat zien dat kleine stapjes de grootste kans op blijvend succes geven. Elke dag krijg je een korte opdracht om die dag op te focussen. Dit maken we zo makkelijk mogelijk met handige filmpjes en artikelen vol tips en inspiratie. Daarnaast sturen we je, als je dat wilt, e-mails en pushberichten om je te motiveren. En bij de challenges rond voeding krijg je iedere dag receptinspiratie om jouw doel te halen.\n\nZo maken we gezond leven voor jou leuker, lekkerder en gemakkelijker!"

In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Hier vind je blogs, doelstellingen, wat je die dag gaat eten en welke activiteiten er gepland staan.\n\nOp de Beweging pagina vind je workouts, lessen en activiteiten. Workouts voer je thuis uit of in de gym. Alles is eenvoudig te casten naar je televisie zodat je vanuit je huiskamer mee kunt doen. Ook kun je je sportactiviteiten bijhouden door ze te loggen. \n\nNaast inspanning is ook ontspanning en een postieve mindset erg belangrijk! Daarom vind je op de Mindset pagina meditaties, ontspannende muziek en leerzame blogs over gedragsverandering. Zo helpen we jou om je goede gewoontes vast te houden.\n\nJe persoonlijke voedingsschema wordt voor je klaar gezet en daarnaast vind je alle tools om hier op een makkelijke manier aan de slag. Zo zijn er 1800+ recepten beschikbaar, kun je eigen maaltijden samenstellen, maaltijden wisselen en direct alle ingrediënten terugvinden op je boodschappenlijst. Zo word jij totaal ontzorgd!\n\nDe aangesloten coaches zorgen ervoor dat jij effectief aan je doelstelling kunt werken op het gebied van afvallen, aankomen en een gezondere levensstijl, zonder dat je een voedingslogboek hoeft bij te houden, calorieën hoeft te tellen of zelf moet bedenken wat er op het menu moet staan.\n\nJouw coach stelt het voedingsschema en je sportprogramma met je in, rekening houdend met jouw doelstelling en voorkeuren. Daarbij kan bijvoorbeeld rekening worden gehouden met het aantal eetmomenten, de macronutriënten verdeling, allergieën, voedingsvoorkeuren, maximale bereidingstijd en koken voor het hele gezin.\n\nVanuit de app kun je overzichtelijk je voortgang volgen in de statistieken en chatten met je coach om vragen te stellen.\n\nProbeer de app en wordt de fitste versie van jezelf met VYTAL!\n\nJe kunt een coach uitkiezen en vrijblijvend een coachverzoek sturen via je profiel bij ‘mijn coach’. De coach zal dan contact met je opnemen om de mogelijkheden te bespreken. Let op: de coach zal een vergoeding vragen voor jouw gebruik van de app en zijn of haar coaching. Deze vergoeding zal per coach verschillen en is afhankelijk van de begeleidingsintensiteit. Vaak biedt een coach meerdere trajecten aan. Overleg dus goed met de coach over waar je naar op zoek bent en wat je van de coach verwacht.\n\nLees meer over onze voorwaarden: https://www.vytal.nl/algemenevoorwaarden.pdf\nLees ons privacybeleid hier: https://www.vytal.nl/privacypolicy.pdf"

      "label": "Are you trying to quit smoking? If you are finding it hard to stop smoking, QuitNow is made for you.\n\nFirst things first: you know smoking is bad for your body. Even so, lots of people keep smoking. So why should you quit? When you quit smoking, you improve the quality and length of your life and the lives of the people around you. One way to prepare to successfully launch your smoke-free life is to power up your phone with QuitNow.\n\nQuitNow is a proven app that engages you to quit smoking. It aims to avoid tobacco just by giving you a picture of yourself. Quitting smoking is easier when you focus your effort on these four sections:\n\n- Your ex-smoker status: When you quit smoking, the focus has to be on you. Remember the day you quitted and get the maths: how many days are you free of smoke, how much money you saved, and how many cigarettes you avoided.\n\n- Achievements: your quit smoking motivations: As with all tasks in life, quitting smoking is easier when you divide the task into small and easy ones. So, QuitNow offers you 70 goals based on the cigarettes you avoided, the days since your last cigarette, and the money saved. So, you will start celebrating achievements from the first day.\n\n- Community: the ex-smokers chat: When you quit smoking, you need to stay within the non-smoking areas. QuitNow offers a chat full of people that, like you, said goodbye to tobacco. Spending time with nonsmokers will make your way easier.\n\n- Your ex-smoker health: QuitNow offers a list of health indicators to explain how your body improves day by day. They are based in the World Health Organization ones, and we update them as soon as the W.H.O. does.\n\n\nIn addition, there are more sections in the preferences screen that could help you in your way to quitting smoking.\n\n- Frequent Asked Questions: there are some tips to quit smoking, and honestly, we don’t know where to put them. Most quitters look for tips on the internet, and there are lots of fake tips there. We researched in the World Health Organization archives to find the investigations they made and the conclusions they had. In the Frequent Asked Questions, you will find all the answers to those questions you have about quitting smoking.\n\n- The QuitNow bot: sometimes, you have strange questions that don’t appear in the F.A.Q. In those cases, you can ask the bot: we train her to answer those strange ones. If she doesn’t have a good answer, she will contact the QuitNow crew and they will update their knowledge base, so she will learn the best answers to your questions. By the way, yes: all the bot answers are extracted from the W.H.O. archives, as the F.A.Q. tips.\n\n- Books to quit smoking: knowing some techniques about quitting smoking makes the task easier. There's always someone talking about books in the chat, so we made an investigation to know which are the most popular, and which ones can actually help you to quit smoking for good.\n\n\nDo you have any idea to make QuitNow even better? If so, please do write to us at ios@fewlaps.com\n\nTerms of Service: https://tos.quitnow.app/eula\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://tos.quitnow.app/privacypolicy"

Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

Wandel alleen of samen met vrienden, familie en collega’s. Verdien XP, medailles, badges en spaar de hersenweetjes van hoogleraar neuropsycholoog Erik Scherder. \n  \nOmmetje is ontwikkelt door de Hersenstichting in nauwe samenwerking met Erik Scherder. Laat je door hem inspireren en start vandaag nog met (een) Ommetje!\n \nDit vind en kun je allemaal met de app:\n \nOMMETJE STARTEN EN STOPPEN\nStart en stop je Ommetje met één klik. Je Ommetjes blijven bewaard. Handig, want zo weet je altijd waar, wanneer en hoe ver je hebt gelopen.\n \nLet op: een Ommetje wordt pas geregistreerd als je meer dan 10 minuten wandelt. Bij minimaal 20 minuten wandelen hebben je hersenen er ook iets aan en verdien je punten.\n \nOMMETJE LEVELS\nBij Ommetje Levels kun je iedere 2 weken een level stijgen - als je tenminste genoeg XP punten verdient. Er zijn in totaal 8 levels. Iedere 2 weken loop je samen met 99 willekeurige gebruikers in een level. Iedere 2 weken promoveert de top 30% naar een nieuw level. De laatste 10% van de gebruikers zakken een level. De rest blijft in hetzelfde level. Na verloop van tijd ‘leert’ de app op welk niveau je zit en kom je in een level met mensen van jouw niveau.\n \nHierdoor ontstaat een gezonde competitie die supermotiverend werkt. Dan loop je met plezier dat extra rondje!\n \nWANDELEN IN JE EIGEN TEAM \nWil je liever in een competitie met vrienden of juist rustig samen wandelen met familie, buren of collega's? Dat kan ook! Start je eigen team of sluit aan bij een bestaand team en help, steun en motiveer elkaar.\n \nMEDAILLES\nIn Ommetje zijn de volgende medailles te verdienen:\n \n• Hiker medaille - Loop dagelijks minimaal twintig minuten en verdien punten voor deze medaille.\n• Reeks medaille - Loop een reeks aaneengesloten dagen en verdien punten voor deze medaille\n• Hart medaille - Deel de app met je vrienden en familie via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter of LinkedIn, na ieder gelopen Ommetje en verdien punten voor deze medaille. \n• Vroege vogel medaille - Start de dag goed en loop een Ommetje voor 9.00 uur ‘s ochtends om punten te verdienen voor deze medaille.\n• Lunch medaille - Loop elke werkdag tussen 11.30 uur en 14.00 uur een Ommetje en verdien punten voor deze medaille. \n• Blijf actief medaille - Laat Ommetje je locatie volgen en loop minimaal 750 meter om punten te verdienen voor deze medaille.\n• Weetjes medaille - Na ieder Ommetje krijg je een Hersenweetje van Erik Scherder. Spaar er zoveel mogelijk voor deze medaille.\n \nIn de app en op de website van de Hersenstichting leggen we uitgebreid uit hoe je deze medailles kunt verdienen.\n \n----\n \nOVERIGE FUNCTIONALITEITEN\n• Bekijk de statistieken van je:\naantal gelopen Ommetjes;\ntotaal gelopen tijd;\nreeks achtereen gelopen dagen;\nlangste reeks.\n• Bekijk je Ommetjes - met een dagelijkse overzicht van je gelopen Ommetjes, behaalde XP en medailles.\n• Accountinstellingen - Pas je gebruikersnaam aan, verwijder je account, start een nieuw team starten of wissel van team.\n• Uitloggen - We weten niet waarom je dit zou willen, maar hier kan je jezelf uitloggen.\n• Feedback - Geef je mening en help ons de app te verbeteren!

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

They already know how to lower their stress level and get sound and restful sleep.\n\nMost psychologists and therapists agree that regular meditation helps and recommend our courses. The programmes are made with mentality specifics in mind and without any kind of esoteric practices. \n\nMo is perfect for beginners. The first lessons last just 4 minutes. Indeed, it is more important to meditate daily, even for a short time. And after some practice, you will be able to switch to longer sessions for experienced users.\n\nAnd who said adults cannot enjoy bedtime stories? We prove them wrong. Start listening to one of our stories and fall asleep gently and deeply. Our narrators will lead you into sweet dreams and restful sleep. It works like magic!\n\nOur library contains 200+ lessons and gets bigger day by day. You will find new items every week. Moreover, you will also be able to record your progress on Apple Health. The most loved meditations are:\n– Antistress\n– Concentration and productivity\n– Sleep meditation\n– Personal relationships\n– Happiness and gratitude\n– Self-esteem\n\nThe free basic course will introduce you to the theoretical principles of meditation and will propose some practical exercises. You will feel the first results just after one week (that’s guaranteed). Download the app now!\n\n“Sound and restful sleep with Mo” — Anne, 36 years old, kindergartener\n\n“Meditation and antistress methods are fundamental in times of crisis” — Alexander, 40 years old, director\n\n“This app is similar to Calm or Headspace but in my mother language, I love it!” — Kate, 19 years old, psychology student\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://momeditation.app/privacy-policy\n\nTerms of Use:\nhttps://momeditation.app/terms-of-use"

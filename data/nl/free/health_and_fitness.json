Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises.

      "label": "Mijn Eetmeter is een online eetdagboek dat mensen helpt om gezonder te eten. Je krijgt inzicht in je eetpatroon en in de hoeveelheid energie en voedingsstoffen die je binnenkrijgt. Ook krijg je concrete tips hoe je gezonder kan kiezen en volgens de Schijf van Vijf kan eten. Wil je afvallen? Met het onderdeel Mijn nieuwe balans ondersteunen we je bij het zetten van kleine maar uitdagende stappen richting een gezonder gewicht. \r\n\r\n\nSNEL JE DAGBOEK INVULLEN MET DE BARCODE-SCANNER \r\nIn de app Mijn Eetmeter kun je de barcodes van producten scannen. Zo voeg je makkelijk en snel producten toe aan jouw dagboek.\r\n\r\n\n120.000 MERKPRODUCTEN \r\nIn Mijn Eetmeter zitten ruim 120.000 (huis)merkartikelen. \r\n\r\n\nAFVALLEN\r\nVeel van de gebruikers van Mijn Eetmeter gebruiken het als hulp bij afvallen. Mijn nieuwe balans helpt daarbij. Je ziet wekelijks:\r\n1. Hoeveel je bent afgevallen en feedback op je gewichtsverloop.  \r\n2. Hoeveel je meer bent gaan eten binnen de Schijf van Vijf. Want gezond eten is de basis tijdens het afvallen én om later je goede veranderingen vast te houden. \r\n3. Hoeveel snacks, dranken en sauzen je neemt. Dit overzicht kan je helpen om een volgende stap uit te zoeken. Bijvoorbeeld het vervangen van frisdrank door een light-variant of water.\r\n4. Hoe goed je (vooruit) gaat qua beweging. Dat kan sport zijn maar ook stevig wandelen en fietsen.  \r\nEn elke week krijg je nieuwe tips die helpen bij het afvallen.\r\n\r\n\nBMI BIJHOUDEN\r\nIn Mijn Eetmeter kun je bijhouden hoe je gewicht zich ontwikkelt. Daarvoor vul je regelmatig je gewicht in. Je ziet dan in een grafiek hoeveel je aankomt of afvalt en of je BMI al gezond is. \r\n\r\n\nBEWEEGMETER\r\nGenoeg bewegen hoort bij een gezonde leefstijl, net als gezond eten. Als je wilt kun je daarom ook bijhouden hoeveel je beweegt en of dit genoeg is om de beweegrichtlijn te halen.\r\n\r\n\nWAT MAAKT MIJN EETMETER UNIEK?\r\n1. Helemaal gratis en zonder commercieel belang\r\nMijn Eetmeter is en blijft gratis. Het Voedingscentrum kan deze app gratis aanbieden omdat wij 100% door de overheid gefinancierd worden om mensen te helpen gezonder te eten. Omdat we geen commercieel belang hebben is onze informatie onafhankelijk en betrouwbaar. We zullen ook nooit je persoonlijke informatie delen met derden.\r\n2. Altijd actueel \r\nIn Mijn Eetmeter vind je algemene voedingsmiddelen, maar ook veel merkproducten. Mijn Eetmeter haalt de productinformatie uit de Levensmiddelendatabank. De productinformatie van merkproducten in deze databank krijgen we direct van fabrikanten. \r\n3. Voedingswaarde zoals je het eet\r\nStaan op het etiket de waarden van de rauwe pasta, dan rekenen wij dit in Mijn Eetmeter voor je om. \r\n4. Advies ook op vitamines en mineralen.\r\nOp het etiket staat hoeveel energie, vet, verzadigd vet, eiwit, koolhydraten zout en soms ook vezels er in het product zit. In Mijn Eetmeter krijg je voor deze voedingsstoffen direct een advies op maat. Maar je kunt in Mijn Eetmeter ook letten op vitamines en mineralen.\r\n5. Volgens de Schijf van Vijf \r\nMensen die graag meer volgens de Schijf van Vijf willen eten, bieden we een Schijf van Vijf-advies aan. Daarin krijg je te zien hoeveel jij al eet volgens de Schijf van Vijf en krijg je tips hoe je gezonder kunt kiezen.\r\n6. Link met de app ‘Kies ik Gezond?’\r\nGebruikers van onze ‘Kies ik Gezond?’-app kunnen producten vanuit die app favoriet maken in Mijn Eetmeter. In deze app zie je per product of het gezond is.\r\n\r\n\nMIJN VOEDINGSCENTRUM\r\nMijn Eetmeter wisselt gegevens uit met de website www.mijnvoedingscentrum.nl. Op deze website kun je met dezelfde gegevens inloggen als met Mijn Eetmeter. Je vindt daar nog meer handige tools. Ook kun je je dagboek en de resultaten downloaden en printen.\r\n\r\n\nSUCCES\n\rOndertussen is de app al ruim 2,5 miljoen keer gedownload en kent vele enthousiaste gebruikers, zoals Elly: “Het gaf inzicht. Bij sommige dingen dacht ik: jee, zoveel calorieën, of zoveel suiker of vet. Je weet het wel, maar je schrikt toch als je die getallen ziet.”"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Met de ‘Kies Ik Gezond?’-app van het Voedingscentrum scan, zoek en vergelijk je eenvoudig producten. In de supermarkt óf thuis op de bank.\n\nMET DE APP: \n1. Vind je gezondere keuzes \n2. Zie je of producten in de Schijf van Vijf staan \n3. Vergelijk je makkelijk producten op voedingswaarden, zoals suiker, vet of zout \n4. Kun je een ingrediënt of allergeen instellen waar je op wilt letten\n5. Kun je letten op vlees of vis\n6. Voeg je producten toe aan Mijn Eetmeter\n\nBARCODE SCANNEN EN ZOEKEN: MAKKELIJK HET ETIKET LEZEN OP JE TELEFOON\nDe kleine lettertjes op het etiket beu? In de app krijg je de voedingswaarden en ingrediënten te zien wanneer je de streepjescode van een product scant. Je kunt ook een product zoeken.\n\nGEZONDER KIEZEN: ALTERNATIEVEN OP EEN RIJ\nStandaard zie je of een product past in de Schijf van Vijf of niet. Bij producten die niet in de Schijf van Vijf passen krijg je gezondere alternatieven te zien. \n\nINGREDIËNTENCHECKER: ALLERGEEN OF INGREDIËNT INSTELLEN\nHeb je een allergie of intolerantie waar je rekening mee wilt houden? Je selecteert eenvoudig dat je wilt letten op gluten, melk, noten, vis of een andere allergeen. \n\nJe kunt ook andere ingrediënten instellen waar je op wilt letten. Denk aan palmolie vanwege het milieu. Of alcohol vanwege je gezondheid of zwangerschap. Je kunt toegevoegde suikers en zout selecteren, handig als je minder suiker of zout wilt eten. Ook als je iets niet lust kun je de checker gebruiken.\n\nLETTEN OP VLEES OF VIS\nWil jij zien of er vlees of vis in een product zit? Of dat het volledig vegetarisch is? Je kunt dit aangeven in je profiel.\n\nJE EIGEN SUPERMARKT: RELEVANTE PRODUCTEN ZIEN\nJe kunt aangeven bij welke supermarkten je boodschappen doet. Dan krijg je de eigenmerken van andere supermarkten niet te zien bij het zoeken naar een product.\n\nLETTEN OP VOEDINGSWAARDEN\nJe kunt aangeven in de app op welke voedingswaarden je extra wilt letten. Het gaat om energie (calorieën), vetten, verzadigde vetten, koolhydraten, suikers, vezels, eiwitten en zout. De voedingswaarden die jij belangrijk vindt komen in de app dan altijd vooraan te staan. Ideaal dus als je bijvoorbeeld minder suiker wilt eten.\n\nPRODUCTEN VERGELIJKEN: EENVOUDIG BEOORDELEN\nMet de Vergelijker in de app kun je eigenschappen van maximaal 3 producten met elkaar vergelijken. Je kunt de voedingswaarden met elkaar vergelijken, bijvoorbeeld de hoeveelheid suiker, zout of vet. Ook kun je zien of de producten in de Schijf van Vijf staan.\n\nSORTEREN: DE GEZONDERE KEUZE BOVENAAN\nAls je een product zoekt, kun je de zoekresultaten sorteren op voedingswaarden. Zo zie je makkelijk in welk product bijvoorbeeld het minste suiker zit. Daarnaast kun je ook sorteren op alfabet of relevantie.\n\nFILTEREN: ALLEEN ZIEN WAT JIJ ZOEKT\nAls je een product zoekt, kun je de zoekresultaten filteren. Je kunt filteren op Schijf van Vijf, supermarkten, merken, productcategorieën en ingrediënten. Als je bijvoorbeeld op Schijf van Vijf filtert, dan krijg je alleen de producten te zien die in de Schijf van Vijf staan.\n\nFAVORIETEN MAKEN\nZoek je sommige producten wel erg vaak op? Maak ze favoriet en je vindt ze altijd snel weer terug.\n\nKOPPELING MET MIJN EETMETER: PRODUCTEN TOEVOEGEN\nGebruik je Mijn Eetmeter en heb je deze als app op je telefoon, dan kun je heel gemakkelijk jouw product toevoegen aan je eetdagboek."

Hier vind je blogs, doelstellingen, wat je die dag gaat eten en welke activiteiten er gepland staan.\n\nOp de Beweging pagina vind je workouts, lessen en activiteiten. Workouts voer je thuis uit of in de gym. Alles is eenvoudig te casten naar je televisie zodat je vanuit je huiskamer mee kunt doen. Ook kun je je sportactiviteiten bijhouden door ze te loggen. \n\nNaast inspanning is ook ontspanning en een postieve mindset erg belangrijk! Daarom vind je op de Mindset pagina meditaties, ontspannende muziek en leerzame blogs over gedragsverandering. Zo helpen we jou om je goede gewoontes vast te houden.\n\nJe persoonlijke voedingsschema wordt voor je klaar gezet en daarnaast vind je alle tools om hier op een makkelijke manier aan de slag. Zo zijn er 1800+ recepten beschikbaar, kun je eigen maaltijden samenstellen, maaltijden wisselen en direct alle ingrediënten terugvinden op je boodschappenlijst. Zo word jij totaal ontzorgd!\n\nDe aangesloten coaches zorgen ervoor dat jij effectief aan je doelstelling kunt werken op het gebied van afvallen, aankomen en een gezondere levensstijl, zonder dat je een voedingslogboek hoeft bij te houden, calorieën hoeft te tellen of zelf moet bedenken wat er op het menu moet staan.\n\nJouw coach stelt het voedingsschema en je sportprogramma met je in, rekening houdend met jouw doelstelling en voorkeuren. Daarbij kan bijvoorbeeld rekening worden gehouden met het aantal eetmomenten, de macronutriënten verdeling, allergieën, voedingsvoorkeuren, maximale bereidingstijd en koken voor het hele gezin.\n\nVanuit de app kun je overzichtelijk je voortgang volgen in de statistieken en chatten met je coach om vragen te stellen.\n\nProbeer de app en wordt de fitste versie van jezelf met VYTAL!\n\nJe kunt een coach uitkiezen en vrijblijvend een coachverzoek sturen via je profiel bij ‘mijn coach’. De coach zal dan contact met je opnemen om de mogelijkheden te bespreken. Let op: de coach zal een vergoeding vragen voor jouw gebruik van de app en zijn of haar coaching. Deze vergoeding zal per coach verschillen en is afhankelijk van de begeleidingsintensiteit. Vaak biedt een coach meerdere trajecten aan. Overleg dus goed met de coach over waar je naar op zoek bent en wat je van de coach verwacht.\n\nLees meer over onze voorwaarden: https://www.vytal.nl/algemenevoorwaarden.pdf\nLees ons privacybeleid hier: https://www.vytal.nl/privacypolicy.pdf"

Volg de instructies van Coach Evy Gruyaert en voor je het weet, loop ook jij 5 km aan één stuk. \n\nWe starten de eerste les met 1 tot 2 minuten joggen afgewisseld met 1 tot 2 minuten wandelen. Je eerste lessen duren 20 minuten en bouwen stelselmatig op naar maximaal 40 minuten in het eerste schema. \n\nHonderdduizenden lopers gingen je voor. Ontdek hun verhalen op onze website www.start2run.app en laat je inspireren. \n\n\n25 TRAININGSSCHEMA'S\n\n\nWe staan voor je klaar om je te begeleiden naar (jouw eerste) 5km, 10 km,  10 miles of misschien wel een (halve) marathon. Wij zorgen ervoor dat jij jouw doel bereikt. De trainingsschema’s in de app zijn opgesteld door ervaren sportcoaches bij Energy Lab. Kies het schema dat bij je past, en coach Evy zal je vertellen wanneer je mag versnellen of vertragen. Het volgen van een schema helpt je om verantwoord op te bouwen waardoor je kans op blessures verkleint. De extra tips die je tijdens de training te horen krijgt, helpen om je loophouding te verbeteren en de juiste keuzes te maken op vlak van voeding & drinken voor, tijdens en na je training. Coach Evy is jouw persoonlijke trainer, jouw digitale loopvriendin die altijd voor je klaar staat om samen te gaan trainen. \n\n\nPERSOONLIJKE AANMOEDIGINGEN\n\nWist je dat coach Evy ook duizenden voornamen insprak, zodat je tijdens de training ook gepersonaliseerde aanmoedigingen kan horen. “Komaan, Sarah, nog even volhouden” of “Ik ben fier op je, Chris”. Ontdek zelf of jouw naam ook reeds beschikbaar is. \n\n\n+500.000 HARDLOPERS\n\nJe staat er niet alleen voor, naast de Hardlopen met Evy app is er ook een actieve Hardlopen met Evy community op facebook en instagram. Wissel ervaringen uit, motiveer elkaar, of vind er het antwoord op al jouw loopvragen.\n\n\nJOUW MUZIEK OF ONZE PLAYLISTS\n\nCombineer jouw trainingen met je favoriete muziek, of laat mij je inspireren via mijn Spotify afspeellijsten. Laat je door de muziek meeslepen en geniet van jouw sportmoment. Misschien ervaar je wel een runner’s high, als je geluk hebt!\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH VERSIE\n\nOok is de Hardlopen met Evy app beschikbaar op Apple Watch en kan de koppeling gemaakt worden met de Gezondheid app van Apple. \nJouw Hardlopen met Evy trainingen kunnen dan ook gesynchroniseerd worden met Apple Gezondheid.\n\n\nABONNEMENT MET GRATIS PROEFPERIODE\n\n\nKrijg toegang tot alle trainingsschema’s via een maand- of jaarabonnement. Als nieuwe klant krijg je een gratis proefversie van 1 week om de app uit te proberen. Je kan dit abonnement starten en beheren via jouw iTunes-account. Je abonnement wordt automatisch verlengd tenzij je het minstens 24u voor het einde van de lopende abonnementsperiode opzegt. De verlenging wordt tijdens deze laatste 24u in rekening gebracht op je account.\n\nOf gebruik de gratis versie van de app om vrije trainingen te registreren en bij te houden in je trainingsdagboek. \n\n\nKIES UIT DEZE STEMMEN \n\n\nBeschikbare stemmen:\n- Evy Gruyaert (NL)\n- Loïc Nottet (FR)\n- Melissa Satta (IT)\n- Sylwina Spiess (DE / GSW) \n\n\n\nZullen we er samen invliegen?\n\n\nHardlopen met Evy voorwaarden: \nhttps://www.hardlopenmetevy.nl/disclaimer/\nHardlopen met Evy website: https://www.hardlopenmetevy.nl"

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

Er zijn gesproken instructies bij noodgevallen zoals bewusteloosheid, brandwonden en reanimeren. Daarnaast vind je geschreven instructies over meer dan 80 situaties waarbij EHBO noodzakelijk is, zoals hyperventilatie, wespensteken of een bloedneus.\n\n\nGeen ziekenhuis, wel EHBO\nDe app is vooral bedoeld voor noodgevallen waarbij niet direct medische hulp van een arts nodig is, maar waarbij EHBO nodig is. Per ongeval of situatie geven we aan hoe je de situatie herkent. Daarna leggen we in overzichtelijke stappen uit wat je zelf kan doen. Uiteraard geven we ook aan wanneer het verstandig is om toch contact op te nemen met de huisarts of de huisartsenpost, of om 112 te bellen. \n\n\nGesproken instructies: reanimeren \nVoor reanimeren biedt de app een gesproken instructie. In twaalf duidelijke stappen begeleidt de app je bij het reanimeren. Hiermee kun je in een stressvolle situatie correct medisch handelen. De instructie kan op elk moment gepauzeerd wordt. Ook is het mogelijk om vanuit het instructiemenu direct 112 te bellen. \n\nLet op: De app geeft niet aan waar AED’s hangen.\n\n\nGesproken instructies: brandwonden\nBij brandwonden begeleiden we je in vier eenvoudige stappen rondom koelen, het verwijderen van kleding en het afdekken van de brandwonden. We geven aan wanneer 112 gebeld moet worden bij brandwonden en bieden je de mogelijkheid om dat meteen vanuit de app te doen. Ook voor bewusteloosheid, hevige bloedingen vergiftiging en ernstige verslikking is er een gesproken instructie.\n\n\nMeer voor je gezondheid: EHBO-producten en -cursussen\nIn de app vind je een link naar de webshop van het Nederlandse Rode Kruis. Hier vind je verschillende EHBO-producten en cursussen. De EHBO-cursussen zijn gericht op verschillende situaties (sport, outdoor, in- en om het huis) en/of verschillende doelgroepen (baby’s, kinderen of volwassen).\n\n\nHet Nederlandse Rode Kruis\nHet Rode Kruis staat voor hulp aan mensen in nood. Dichtbij als je je enkel verzwikt tijdens een hardloopwedstrijd, maar ook ver weg. Via 197 afdelingen bieden we hulp, bijvoorbeeld bij evenementen en bij rampen. Het Nederlandse Rode Kruis maakt deel uit van het Internationale Rode Kruis- en de Rode Halve Maanbeweging. Met de EHBO-app willen wij bijdragen aan ons doel: hulp bieden aan mensen in nood."

      "label": "The Beat the Microbead app is the fastest way to learn if your cosmetics and personal care products contain plastic ingredients. This app uses state-of-the-art text recognition technology. Just scan the ingredients of your products and check them for microplastics. Not only that, but you can also get to know microplastic-free brands certified by us.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIt’s straightforward: you can scan products with four easy steps:\n- Find the ingredients list on your product.\n- Position the full list within your camera frame.\n- Make sure the ingredients are clear to read.\n- Take a picture to scan!\n\nA traffic light rating system\n\n- RED: Products that contain microplastics.\n- ORANGE: Products that contain what we call “sceptical” microplastics. With this, we mean synthetic polymers for which there is not enough information available.\n- GREEN: Products that do not contain microplastics.\n\nHelp us enrich our database!\n\nEvery time you add a product to our database, you help us build a case against microplastics. With every product information, we can create evidence and convince authorities about the extensive use of plastic ingredients. A bit of extra effort on your side makes you a part of the fight against microplastics in cosmetics and care products. So, go ahead, scan the barcode of your product and help us get some more information!\n\nBy adding the products to our database, you can also discover our certified microplastic-free brands. These brands have their entire range of products free of all known microplastic ingredients.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nPlastic in cosmetics is a global problem! Microplastics are hardly visible ingredients that pollute our planet & may pose health risks. These microplastics, hardly visible to the naked eye, flow straight from the bathroom drain into the sewer system. Microplastics are not biodegradable, and once they enter the (marine) environment, they are almost impossible to remove.\n\nSea animals absorb or eat microplastics; these particles are passed along the marine food chain. Since humans are ultimately at the top of this food chain, it is likely that we also ingest microplastics.\n\nUsing body washes or cosmetics that contain microplastics can put the ocean, ourselves, and our children at risk! With this app, you can get aware of this issue and make environmentally friendly choices.\n\nWho is behind this app?\n\nThe collaborators behind this app include the following partners:\n\nPlastic Soup Foundation: NGO based in Amsterdam, initiators of the worldwide campaign “Beat the Microbead”. Their mission: No plastic in our water or our bodies!\n\nPINCH: a renowned mobile development agency from Amsterdam that is proud of their work for the Plastic Soup Foundation."

Even so, lots of people keep smoking. So why should you quit? When you quit smoking, you improve the quality and length of your life and the lives of the people around you. One way to prepare to successfully launch your smoke-free life is to power up your phone with QuitNow.\n\nQuitNow is a proven app that engages you to quit smoking. It aims to avoid tobacco just by giving you a picture of yourself. Quitting smoking is easier when you focus your effort on these four sections:\n\n- Your ex-smoker status: When you quit smoking, the focus has to be on you. Remember the day you quitted and get the maths: how many days are you free of smoke, how much money you saved, and how many cigarettes you avoided.\n\n- Achievements: your quit smoking motivations: As with all tasks in life, quitting smoking is easier when you divide the task into small and easy ones. So, QuitNow offers you 70 goals based on the cigarettes you avoided, the days since your last cigarette, and the money saved. So, you will start celebrating achievements from the first day.\n\n- Community: the ex-smokers chat: When you quit smoking, you need to stay within the non-smoking areas. QuitNow offers a chat full of people that, like you, said goodbye to tobacco. Spending time with nonsmokers will make your way easier.\n\n- Your ex-smoker health: QuitNow offers a list of health indicators to explain how your body improves day by day. They are based in the World Health Organization ones, and we update them as soon as the W.H.O. does.\n\n\nIn addition, there are more sections in the preferences screen that could help you in your way to quitting smoking.\n\n- Frequent Asked Questions: there are some tips to quit smoking, and honestly, we don’t know where to put them. Most quitters look for tips on the internet, and there are lots of fake tips there. We researched in the World Health Organization archives to find the investigations they made and the conclusions they had. In the Frequent Asked Questions, you will find all the answers to those questions you have about quitting smoking.\n\n- The QuitNow bot: sometimes, you have strange questions that don’t appear in the F.A.Q. In those cases, you can ask the bot: we train her to answer those strange ones. If she doesn’t have a good answer, she will contact the QuitNow crew and they will update their knowledge base, so she will learn the best answers to your questions. By the way, yes: all the bot answers are extracted from the W.H.O. archives, as the F.A.Q. tips.\n\n- Books to quit smoking: knowing some techniques about quitting smoking makes the task easier. There's always someone talking about books in the chat, so we made an investigation to know which are the most popular, and which ones can actually help you to quit smoking for good.\n\n\nDo you have any idea to make QuitNow even better? If so, please do write to us at ios@fewlaps.com\n\nTerms of Service: https://tos.quitnow.app/eula\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://tos.quitnow.app/privacypolicy"

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I.

You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "Virtuagym Food: Helping you to live healthy and feel great. Get a free personalized nutrition plan by answering a few questions about your lifestyle and goals. We support plans for many goals: weight loss, maintaining weight, weight gain and building muscle. Eat what you want, but keep an eye on those calories, carbs and fats!\n\nFEATURES\n* Food Database Validated by Expert Nutritionists\n* Add your own foods\n* Save meals and add them instantly next time\n* Nutrition tracking for several goals (e.g. weight loss & muscle building)\n* More than a calorie counter: keep an eye on those carbs, proteins and fats as well\n* Integrated with Virtuagym Fitness for home & gym workouts\n* Health app integration: Sync workouts from other apps, and save your eaten calories, carbs, proteins and fat in the Health app, so other apps can use this data\n\nWHY VIRTUAGYM IS THE BEST\n- Many other nutrition apps or calorie counters don’t have a lot of knowledge about fitness. Therefore, mistakes are being made with calorie tracking. Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises. If you have any suggestions, let us know. If you want to stay updated, get useful fitness tips or if you need motivation: follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPRO SUBSCRIPTION\nTo unlock the full app you can subscribe to our PRO membership.

      "label": "Mijn Eetmeter is een online eetdagboek dat mensen helpt om gezonder te eten. Je krijgt inzicht in je eetpatroon en in de hoeveelheid energie en voedingsstoffen die je binnenkrijgt. Ook krijg je concrete tips hoe je gezonder kan kiezen en volgens de Schijf van Vijf kan eten. Dat kan allemaal ook helpen om af te vallen. \n\nSNEL JE DAGBOEK INVULLEN MET DE BARCODE-SCANNER \nIn de app Mijn Eetmeter kun je de barcodes van producten scannen. Zo voeg je makkelijk en snel producten toe aan jouw dagboek.\n\n90.000 MERKPRODUCTEN \nIn Mijn Eetmeter zitten ruim 90.000 (huis)merkartikelen. \n\nWAT MAAKT MIJN EETMETER UNIEK?\n\n1. Helemaal gratis en zonder commercieel belang\n\nMijn Eetmeter is en blijft gratis. Het Voedingscentrum kan deze app gratis aanbieden omdat wij 100% door de overheid gefinancierd worden om mensen te helpen gezonder te eten. Omdat we geen commercieel belang hebben is onze informatie onafhankelijk en betrouwbaar. We zullen ook nooit je persoonlijke informatie delen met derden.\n\n2. Altijd actueel \n\nMijn Eetmeter is de enige app die de productinformatie direct haalt uit de databanken van fabrikanten. Passen de fabrikanten het etiket aan, dan krijgen wij dus automatisch de meest actuele productgegevens. \n\n3. Voedingswaarde zoals je het eet\n\nScan of selecteer je bijvoorbeeld een pasta, dan wil je natuurlijk de voedingswaarden toevoegen van de gekookte pasta; zo eet je het immers. Staan op het etiket de waarden van de rauwe pasta, dan rekenen wij dit in Mijn Eetmeter voor je om. Of als je groente eet, dan kun je kiezen of je dit rauw of gewokt eet bijvoorbeeld.\n\n4. Advies ook op vitamines en mineralen.\n\nOp het etiket staat hoeveel energie, vet, verzadigd vet, eiwit, koolhydraten, vezels en zout er in het product zit. In Mijn Eetmeter krijg je voor deze voedingsstoffen direct een advies op maat. Maar je kunt in Mijn Eetmeter ook letten op vitamines en mineralen. Wij koppelen namelijk alle producten aan algemene voedingswaarden. Zo kunnen wij je inzicht geven in alle voedingstoffen. \n\n5. Volgens de Schijf van Vijf \n\nMensen die graag meer volgens de Schijf van Vijf willen eten, bieden we een Schijf van Vijf-advies aan. Daarin krijg je te zien hoeveel jij al eet volgens de Schijf van Vijf en krijg je tips hoe je gezonder kunt kiezen.\n\n6. Link met de app ‘Kies ik Gezond?’\n\nGebruikers van onze ‘Kies ik Gezond?’-app kunnen producten vanuit die app favoriet maken in Mijn Eetmeter. In deze app zie je per product of het gezond is.\n\nAFVALLEN\nVeel van de gebruikers van Mijn Eetmeter gebruiken het als hulp bij afvallen. Mijn Eetmeter helpt je bewust te maken welke producten veel calorieën leveren en je kunt eenvoudig bijhouden hoeveel je eet.\n\nBMI BIJHOUDEN\nIn Mijn Eetmeter kun je bijhouden hoe je gewicht zich ontwikkelt. Daarvoor vul je regelmatig je gewicht in. Je ziet dan in een grafiek hoeveel je aankomt of afvalt. \n\nBEWEEGMETER\nGenoeg bewegen hoort bij een gezonde leefstijl, net als gezond eten. Als je wilt kun je daarom ook bijhouden hoeveel je beweegt en of dit genoeg is om de norm voor beweging te halen.\n\nMIJN VOEDINGSCENTRUM\nMijn Eetmeter wisselt gegevens uit met de website www.mijnvoedingscentrum.nl. Op deze website kun je met dezelfde gegevens inloggen als met Mijn Eetmeter. Je vindt daar nog meer handige tools. Ook kun je je dagboek en de resultaten downloaden en printen.\n\nSUCCES\nOndertussen is de app al ruim een miljoen keer gedownload en kent vele enthousiaste gebruikers, zoals Elly: “Het gaf inzicht. Bij sommige dingen dacht ik: jee, zoveel calorieën, of zoveel suiker of vet. Je weet het wel, maar je schrikt toch als je die getallen ziet.”"

It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science.

Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Dat is wetenschappelijk bewezen! Actify helpt je met kleine oefeningen in de vorm van mini’s stap voor stap naar een gezonde leefstijl. Je ontwikkelt zo gezonde gewoontes die passen bij jouw dagelijkse routine. De Actify-app zit vol recepten, workouts en meditaties die je helpen bij het werken aan je gezondheid en vitaliteit. Je voelt je gezonder en energieker door meer te ontspannen en beter te slapen, gezonder te eten of meer te bewegen. Zonder dat je op dieet of naar de sportschool hoeft!  \r\nDoor kleine stappen regelmatig te herhalen leert Actify je wennen aan nieuwe gewoontes, zodat ze net als tandenpoetsen vanzelf een onderdeel worden van je dagelijkse routine. En met Actify als coach heb je alles wat je nodig hebt binnen handbereik. Dankzij de praktische tips, workouts, recepten, coachsessies en mindfulness meditaties ontwikkel je een gezonde leefstijl die bij jou past.  \r\nGa met Actify op je eigen tempo aan de slag met jouw doel. Wil je ontspannen en beter slapen, meer bewegen of gezonder eten? Na de keuze voor een doel geeft jouw coach je suggesties voor nieuwe gewoontes. Alle gewoontes in de Actify-app zijn ontwikkeld op basis van wetenschappelijke inzichten. Wist je dat uit onderzoek blijkt dat gezonder leven makkelijker en leuker wordt als je kleine stappen zet? De kracht zit daarnaast in de herhaling. Hoe vaker je iets doet, hoe meer het vanzelf gaat. En een gezonde leefstijl die past in jouw dagelijkse routine werkt beter dan het volgen van een dieet of af en toe een sportschoolbezoek. In kleine stappen naar je gezonde gewoontes levert bovendien een duurzaam resultaat op!  "

Hier vind je blogs, doelstellingen, wat je die dag gaat eten en welke activiteiten er gepland staan.\n\nOp de Beweging pagina vind je workouts, lessen en activiteiten. Workouts voer je thuis uit of in de gym. Alles is eenvoudig te casten naar je televisie zodat je vanuit je huiskamer mee kunt doen. Ook kun je je sportactiviteiten bijhouden door ze te loggen. \n\nNaast inspanning is ook ontspanning en een postieve mindset erg belangrijk! Daarom vind je op de Mindset pagina meditaties, ontspannende muziek en leerzame blogs over gedragsverandering. Zo helpen we jou om je goede gewoontes vast te houden.\n\nJe persoonlijke voedingsschema wordt voor je klaar gezet en daarnaast vind je alle tools om hier op een makkelijke manier aan de slag. Zo zijn er 1800+ recepten beschikbaar, kun je eigen maaltijden samenstellen, maaltijden wisselen en direct alle ingrediënten terugvinden op je boodschappenlijst. Zo word jij totaal ontzorgd!\n\nDe aangesloten coaches zorgen ervoor dat jij effectief aan je doelstelling kunt werken op het gebied van afvallen, aankomen en een gezondere levensstijl, zonder dat je een voedingslogboek hoeft bij te houden, calorieën hoeft te tellen of zelf moet bedenken wat er op het menu moet staan.\n\nJouw coach stelt het voedingsschema en je sportprogramma met je in, rekening houdend met jouw doelstelling en voorkeuren. Daarbij kan bijvoorbeeld rekening worden gehouden met het aantal eetmomenten, de macronutriënten verdeling, allergieën, voedingsvoorkeuren, maximale bereidingstijd en koken voor het hele gezin.\n\nVanuit de app kun je overzichtelijk je voortgang volgen in de statistieken en chatten met je coach om vragen te stellen.\n\nProbeer de app en wordt de fitste versie van jezelf met VYTAL!\n\nJe kunt een coach uitkiezen en vrijblijvend een coachverzoek sturen via je profiel bij ‘mijn coach’. De coach zal dan contact met je opnemen om de mogelijkheden te bespreken. Let op: de coach zal een vergoeding vragen voor jouw gebruik van de app en zijn of haar coaching. Deze vergoeding zal per coach verschillen en is afhankelijk van de begeleidingsintensiteit. Vaak biedt een coach meerdere trajecten aan. Overleg dus goed met de coach over waar je naar op zoek bent en wat je van de coach verwacht.\n\nLees meer over onze voorwaarden: https://www.vytal.nl/algemenevoorwaarden.pdf\nLees ons privacybeleid hier: https://www.vytal.nl/privacypolicy.pdf"

Lose weight and keep it off with the science, support, simplicity, and sustainability of our award-winning program.  \n\nOur customized plans are like a nutritionist in your pocket. Unlike some other weight-loss programs, we take a beyond-calorie approach, guiding you toward the most nutritious foods and healthier patterns of eating. \n\n\n\nHow WeightWatchers Works\nQuick fixes don’t last. WeightWatchers does. Our nutrition and behavior change experts have designed a program that ensures:\n\n\nNutrition with no guesswork.

When you sign up, you’ll get a customized nutrition plan, which includes a number of Points to spend (and track) each day. There are no rules, restrictions, or red-flag foods—just learning how to eat and get to your goals. \n\n\nA strong support system. A private members-only social community, 24/7 live coach chat, 5-Minute Coaching audios—we've got it all. \n\n\nMotivation to get moving. More activity means more weight loss. Ease into exercise with fun on-demand classes from obé Fitness and simple ways to move more (housework counts!). Plus, you can sync your fitness tracker and Apple Health. \n\n\nBetter sleep. Science shows people who get consistently less sleep are hungrier throughout the day. Learn to get better shut-eye, track your sleep, relax with Breethe meditations, and get 5-Minute Coaching audios to help you de-stress.  \n\n\nGet the results you want with easy-to-use features on your mobile phone.\n- Customized food plan and Points Budget \n- Food, activity, water, sleep, and weight trackers\n- Barcode scanner for packaged foods, recipe database, and restaurant finder\n- Meditations and all-level workouts\n- Progress reports\n- 24/7 live coach chat\n- 12,000+ recipes \n- Blood sugar tracker (with the WeightWatchers Diabetes-Tailored Plan)\n\nDownload the WW app now and get a free trial today! After your free trial, your plan auto-renews monthly unless you cancel before the trial ends.\n\n\nMEMBERSHIP TERMS\n\nFor auto-renewing membership plans, your iTunes account will be charged at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the previously selected rate. Your payment will continue to automatically renew unless you turn off auto-renewal at least 24 hours prior to your next renewal date. Your WeightWatchers Core membership can be managed or canceled in your Apple ID account settings.

      "label": "OOK JIJ KAN HET!\nTrain naar jouw eerste 5km via Hardlopen met Evy\n\nHet enige wat jij hoeft te doen, is je veters strikken. Volg de instructies van Coach Evy Gruyaert en voor je het weet, loop ook jij 5 km aan één stuk. \n\nWe starten de eerste les met 1 tot 2 minuten joggen afgewisseld met 1 tot 2 minuten wandelen. Je eerste lessen duren 20 minuten en bouwen stelselmatig op naar maximaal 40 minuten in het eerste schema. \n\nHonderdduizenden lopers gingen je voor. Ontdek hun verhalen op onze website www.start2run.app en laat je inspireren. \n\n\n25 TRAININGSSCHEMA'S\n\n\nWe staan voor je klaar om je te begeleiden naar (jouw eerste) 5km, 10 km,  10 miles of misschien wel een (halve) marathon. Wij zorgen ervoor dat jij jouw doel bereikt. De trainingsschema’s in de app zijn opgesteld door ervaren sportcoaches bij Energy Lab. Kies het schema dat bij je past, en coach Evy zal je vertellen wanneer je mag versnellen of vertragen. Het volgen van een schema helpt je om verantwoord op te bouwen waardoor je kans op blessures verkleint. De extra tips die je tijdens de training te horen krijgt, helpen om je loophouding te verbeteren en de juiste keuzes te maken op vlak van voeding & drinken voor, tijdens en na je training. Coach Evy is jouw persoonlijke trainer, jouw digitale loopvriendin die altijd voor je klaar staat om samen te gaan trainen. \n\n\nPERSOONLIJKE AANMOEDIGINGEN\n\nWist je dat coach Evy ook duizenden voornamen insprak, zodat je tijdens de training ook gepersonaliseerde aanmoedigingen kan horen. “Komaan, Sarah, nog even volhouden” of “Ik ben fier op je, Chris”. Ontdek zelf of jouw naam ook reeds beschikbaar is. \n\n\n+500.000 HARDLOPERS\n\nJe staat er niet alleen voor, naast de Hardlopen met Evy app is er ook een actieve Hardlopen met Evy community op facebook en instagram. Wissel ervaringen uit, motiveer elkaar, of vind er het antwoord op al jouw loopvragen.\n\n\nJOUW MUZIEK OF ONZE PLAYLISTS\n\nCombineer jouw trainingen met je favoriete muziek, of laat mij je inspireren via mijn Spotify afspeellijsten. Laat je door de muziek meeslepen en geniet van jouw sportmoment. Misschien ervaar je wel een runner’s high, als je geluk hebt!\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH VERSIE\n\nOok is de Hardlopen met Evy app beschikbaar op Apple Watch en kan de koppeling gemaakt worden met de Gezondheid app van Apple. \nJouw Hardlopen met Evy trainingen kunnen dan ook gesynchroniseerd worden met Apple Gezondheid.\n\n\nABONNEMENT MET GRATIS PROEFPERIODE\n\n\nKrijg toegang tot alle trainingsschema’s via een maand- of jaarabonnement. Als nieuwe klant krijg je een gratis proefversie van 1 week om de app uit te proberen. Je kan dit abonnement starten en beheren via jouw iTunes-account. Je abonnement wordt automatisch verlengd tenzij je het minstens 24u voor het einde van de lopende abonnementsperiode opzegt. De verlenging wordt tijdens deze laatste 24u in rekening gebracht op je account.\n\nOf gebruik de gratis versie van de app om vrije trainingen te registreren en bij te houden in je trainingsdagboek. \n\n\nKIES UIT DEZE STEMMEN \n\n\nBeschikbare stemmen:\n- Evy Gruyaert (NL)\n- Loïc Nottet (FR)\n- Melissa Satta (IT)\n- Sylwina Spiess (DE / GSW) \n\n\n\nZullen we er samen invliegen?\n\n\nHardlopen met Evy voorwaarden: \nhttps://www.hardlopenmetevy.nl/disclaimer/\nHardlopen met Evy website: https://www.hardlopenmetevy.nl"

No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "Met de ‘Kies Ik Gezond?’-app van het Voedingscentrum scan, zoek en vergelijk je eenvoudig producten. In de supermarkt óf thuis op de bank.\n\nMET DE APP: \n1. Vind je gezondere keuzes \n2. Zie je of producten in de Schijf van Vijf staan \n3. Vergelijk je makkelijk producten op voedingswaarden, zoals suiker, vet of zout \n4. Kun je een ingrediënt of allergeen instellen waar je op wilt letten\n5. Kun je letten op vlees of vis\n6. Voeg je producten toe aan Mijn Eetmeter\n\nBARCODE SCANNEN EN ZOEKEN: MAKKELIJK HET ETIKET LEZEN OP JE TELEFOON\nDe kleine lettertjes op het etiket beu? In de app krijg je de voedingswaarden en ingrediënten te zien wanneer je de streepjescode van een product scant. Je kunt ook een product zoeken.\n\nGEZONDER KIEZEN: ALTERNATIEVEN OP EEN RIJ\nStandaard zie je of een product past in de Schijf van Vijf of niet. Bij producten die niet in de Schijf van Vijf passen krijg je gezondere alternatieven te zien. \n\nINGREDIËNTENCHECKER: ALLERGEEN OF INGREDIËNT INSTELLEN\nHeb je een allergie of intolerantie waar je rekening mee wilt houden? Je selecteert eenvoudig dat je wilt letten op gluten, melk, noten, vis of een andere allergeen. \n\nJe kunt ook andere ingrediënten instellen waar je op wilt letten. Denk aan palmolie vanwege het milieu. Of alcohol vanwege je gezondheid of zwangerschap. Je kunt toegevoegde suikers en zout selecteren, handig als je minder suiker of zout wilt eten. Ook als je iets niet lust kun je de checker gebruiken.\n\nLETTEN OP VLEES OF VIS\nWil jij zien of er vlees of vis in een product zit? Of dat het volledig vegetarisch is? Je kunt dit aangeven in je profiel.\n\nJE EIGEN SUPERMARKT: RELEVANTE PRODUCTEN ZIEN\nJe kunt aangeven bij welke supermarkten je boodschappen doet. Dan krijg je de eigenmerken van andere supermarkten niet te zien bij het zoeken naar een product.\n\nLETTEN OP VOEDINGSWAARDEN\nJe kunt aangeven in de app op welke voedingswaarden je extra wilt letten. Het gaat om energie (calorieën), vetten, verzadigde vetten, koolhydraten, suikers, vezels, eiwitten en zout. De voedingswaarden die jij belangrijk vindt komen in de app dan altijd vooraan te staan. Ideaal dus als je bijvoorbeeld minder suiker wilt eten.\n\nPRODUCTEN VERGELIJKEN: EENVOUDIG BEOORDELEN\nMet de Vergelijker in de app kun je eigenschappen van maximaal 3 producten met elkaar vergelijken. Je kunt de voedingswaarden met elkaar vergelijken, bijvoorbeeld de hoeveelheid suiker, zout of vet. Ook kun je zien of de producten in de Schijf van Vijf staan.\n\nSORTEREN: DE GEZONDERE KEUZE BOVENAAN\nAls je een product zoekt, kun je de zoekresultaten sorteren op voedingswaarden. Zo zie je makkelijk in welk product bijvoorbeeld het minste suiker zit. Daarnaast kun je ook sorteren op alfabet of relevantie.\n\nFILTEREN: ALLEEN ZIEN WAT JIJ ZOEKT\nAls je een product zoekt, kun je de zoekresultaten filteren. Je kunt filteren op Schijf van Vijf, supermarkten, merken, productcategorieën en ingrediënten. Als je bijvoorbeeld op Schijf van Vijf filtert, dan krijg je alleen de producten te zien die in de Schijf van Vijf staan.\n\nFAVORIETEN MAKEN\nZoek je sommige producten wel erg vaak op? Maak ze favoriet en je vindt ze altijd snel weer terug.\n\nKOPPELING MET MIJN EETMETER: PRODUCTEN TOEVOEGEN\nGebruik je Mijn Eetmeter en heb je deze als app op je telefoon, dan kun je heel gemakkelijk jouw product toevoegen aan je eetdagboek."

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

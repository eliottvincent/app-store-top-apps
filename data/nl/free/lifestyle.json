      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Dat maakt het een stuk makkelijker om te zien welke woningen er nieuw bij zijn gekomen!\n\nJe zoekopdracht instellen\nJe kunt al je persoonlijke voorkeuren instellen in je zoekopdracht, zodat je in de lijst of op de kaart alleen huizen ziet die écht bij jouw woonwensen passen. \n\nWe zijn continu bezig om de app nog beter te maken, door het toevoegen van nieuwe functies of door het verbeteren van bestaande.

With Breeze, it’s effortless to go on a spontaneous date.\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n1) Our algorithm makes a limited selection of profiles each day. You choose if you’d like to meet someone. \n2) If there’s a match, you cannot chat. Instead, you both share your availability with a date picker.\n3) We organize the date and let you know where to be at what time, the rest is up to you!\n\nBreeze doesn’t show you ads and doesn’t sell data or premium subscriptions like other dating apps. You only pay for the actual date activity, that’s where Breeze takes a small margin. This aligns the intention of the app and the user: getting you on an actual date!\n\nGo on offline dates, with Breeze!"

Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only."

Purchased name sets will also be available for your partner. \n\nKinder has over 18.000 names in the library with a grand variety in origins so you can find that unique name that your child will write history with!\n \nFAQ’s\nI can’t connect to my partner, please help!\nIf you can’t connect it might be that the connection code is expired. Please try to invite each other once more. If that doesn’t help it might be your time settings; those must be set to automatic, otherwise the connection mechanism can’t connect you unfortunately. \n\nI don’t see our matches!\nWe try to update matches every 30 seconds. So please bear with us! If after that time you still don’t see them, please try to restart the app. \n\nIf I purchase a name set, will my partner also get these?\n Yes! It might not show up in a split second, but if you’re connected purchases will be shared. \n\nI bought a new phone, what will happen with my Kinder likes?\nWe are very sorry, unfortunately we don’t have a feature to save your likes, dismisses and matches just yet. We are working on a solution to save these though.\n\nWho runs Kinder? \nKinder is app started by me; Krijn Haasnoot. I’m a Dutch guy who had an idea after having dinner with a couple of friends years ago. They were having their first child and my question was: ‘How do you find a name?’. Their answer was: ‘Probably some books, the internet, family’. I immediately thought, ‘that can be more fun’ and I came up with the idea of using an intuitive swipe like selection mechanism used by another app, but than with baby names! And it should be able to match likes between partners!’\n\nI don’t think Kinder is the end solution to choose the name for your child, I just hope to inspire, get the discussion going in a positive way and help out! Having a baby is a fun, sacred, but also tiring and possibly stressful time. Let’s take a small thing out and make it nicer. \n\nAs you can read, Kinder is just a small one-man company.  \n\nWant to learn more? Work together? Feel free to reach out to me through FB messenger or krijn.kinderapp@gmail.com"

      "label": "With Luna, you'll always have a baby monitor at hand when you need one. Luna converts two iPhones or iPads into one secure baby monitor with unlimited range. Receive an alarm when your baby cries, listen to the automated audio stream or look at live video footage. You can use the app when connected to Wi-Fi or with a 3G or LTE mobile connection. Luna consumes much less battery power and data than other baby monitor apps. Luna is consistently reliable, even when it's running in the background.\n\nRELIABLE, SIMPLE, SECURE\n\nBy using the latest technology, Luna offers maximum reliability and security. You'll never miss an alarm again.\n\nCLEVER DESIGN\n\nWe've invested a lot of time in creating a sophisticated and beautiful design. That is why Luna isn't just user-friendly, it's also nice to look at. Plus, while Luna is monitoring your baby, it displays all the important features.\n\nINTELLIGENT ECO MODE SAVES BATTERY LIFE AND DATA\n\nThanks to our unique Eco-Mode, the Luna app uses 4 times less battery power than any other baby monitoring app while also conserving your data usage.\n\nUNLIMITED COVERAGE\n\nWherever you are,. as long as you have an Internet connection, the Luna app consistently sends you alarms and live audio streams when your child wakes up.\n\nAUDIO AND VIDEO STREAMING\n\nYour Luna parent station automatically receives a live audio stream whenever there's noise in the children's room. Alternatively, you can check the app yourself at any time you like. The video stream will also be activated at any time - without any feedback.\n\nRUNS RELIABLY IN THE BACKGROUND\n\nLuna is a multitasker! As opposed to other baby monitor apps, Luna runs reliably without issues in the background. This frees you up to use your mobile device for other things when you need to.\n\nADJUSTABLE SENSITIVITY \n\nLuna will graphically display the background audio level of the last few minutes. The app will also help you to define the right alarm threshold.\n\nACTIVITY LOG\n\nLuna shows you how long your child has been sleeping and it provides you with a notification record.\n\nENCRYPTED DATA TRANSFER\n\nWe protect your privacy. All data transfers made by Luna are encrypted by SSL. This means that no one else will be able to access your data.\n\nINTELLIGENT CONNECTION MONITORING\n\nYou're on the road and the internet connection went down? Don't worry! Luna continuously monitors the connection between the baby station and the parent station and will notifiy you in case of any interruptions. Luna will also try to automatically restore the connection as quickly as possible.\n\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\n\nYou will need at least two iOS devices (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 2/iPad Mini or newer, iOS 9.3 or newer).\nMake sure that both devices are connected to the internet, and you're good to go!\n\nHONEST APPS, MADE IN GERMANY\n\nA baby monitor which does exactly what it says on the tin: A reliable notification whenever your child cries. \n\nWe're Uberblic Labs, a small development team based in Berlin. You might know our app, ParcelTrack, enjoyed by millions of users worldwide. We develop apps which meet their promises. We hope you like our new baby monitor.

If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

      "label": "With IKEA Home smart app and DIRIGERA hub, it's easy to create smarter everyday moments with lighting, speakers, blinds and air quality products. \r\n\r\nPicture yourself waking up as your smart lights gently rise. Your favorite songs play on the speakers and you still haven't gotten out of bed. How lovely, right? Smart products like lighting, speakers, blinds and air purifiers can make a lovely addition to your everyday life. When you improve the IQ of your home, life itself runs a bit smoother.\r\n\r\nThe magic happens when you combine two or more smart products from IKEA, tell them what to do in the app and save it as a 'Scene'.\r\n\r\nA great scene is one you will use often. Think about waking up and going to bed, cooking and eating, date night and family time, or leaving and coming home. All everyday moments when we can support you with the best lighting, sound that suits your mood, and cleaner air.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone, from young to old and even visitors. So while the app gives you total control to customize your smart home, our range of remotes make it easy for everyone to live with and use a smart home.\r\n\r\nIn control \r\n• You can control products individually or in groups. You can turn whole rooms on and off or the whole home, all at once.\r\n• Dim and change light colours, adjust blinds, speaker volume, and much more.\r\n• Set the scenes you need and trigger them with schedules, a shortcut button or use the app.\r\n\r\nEasy to use\r\n• The home screen gives a fast overview of your whole home. Quickly control products, access rooms, or start/stop scenes. This is also where you add new products, rooms, and scenes. \r\n\r\nOrganized and personal\r\n• Organizing your smart products in rooms gives fast access to the products you want to control.\r\n• Personalize the app with your choice of icons, names and colours for rooms and products\r\n• Create personal scenes, for example your own combination of cosy lighting and your favorite music. \r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n• Connect to Apple Home, Amazon Alexa or Google Home to use a voice assistant."

Find salons in your area, read reviews, book (rebook and reschedule), on the Treatwell app. Whichever treatment you’re after – haircut, wax, massage – we’ll help you sort a salon slot, 24/7. \n\nIt’s quick and easy – our app users can vouch for that – so you can book your next appointment in under 45 seconds, for real. Go for your usual, or try out a new treatment, and discover the most-loved salons in your area. No places nearby? We bring salons onto Treatwell every day, so if you can’t find a venue near you just yet, you (hopefully) will soon.  \n\nAll of that – and more great stuff below – on the Treatwell app.\n\nWhy booking online is better:\n\n- Scroll through our list of treatment categories, and book your usual, or try something new. \n\n- Filter thousands of salons, to find the best in your area. Found a keeper? Save it to ‘Your favourites’ because, well, it’s your favourite, and rebook there (easily) next time. \n\n- Read reviews - millions of them - written by our customers, so you know what to expect at every salon. \n\n- Add appointments to your calendar; life’s busy, we’ll keep track.\n\n- Find your salon easily, with our in-app map functionality. \n\n- Choose an off-peak time (like afternoons, or ‘quiet periods’) to get a better price. \n\n- Pre-pay, pre-treatment, so you can stroll in and out of the salon on the day.\n\n- Manage all your appointments in one place – rebook, reschedule or cancel if you need to. \n\n- Get push notifications straight to your home screen, so you never forget an appointment, or miss a discount, again.\n\n\nShare your thoughts with us.

Pick the layout you like best, then edit it to make it your own.\n\nLayout's smooth, intuitive process gives you complete creative control. Tap to mirror, flip or replace images, hold and drag to swap them, pinch to zoom in or out, or pull the handles to resize. You're the editor, so get creative—tell a story, show off an outfit or just splice, dice and change the look of your regular photos to convey a mood or theme. \n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Re-mix up to 9 of your photos at a time to create fun, personalized layouts.\n* Use the Faces tab to quickly find photos with people in them.  \n* Capture the moment in Photo Booth mode with quick, spontaneous shots.  \n* Save your layouts to your camera roll and share them seamlessly to Instagram or other networks.\n* Easily see the last 30 photos you've selected in the Recents tab. \n* Pair your layouts with Instagram's filters and creative tools afterwards to make them stand out even more. \n* Download and start creating immediately. No signup or account required—and no clutter breaking up your flow."

Enjoy the show on your big screen. \n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> UPGRADE FEATURES (available as in-app purchases)\n\n* Premium Edition: Unlocks all of the features listed here. Also future features are included, so you do not have to pay for them when they are released in an updated app version. \n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker: Blocks ads & popups on most websites and removes the sponsoring ads from the app. You can update and enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!!

Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here.

Enjoy the show on your big screen with the no#1 web video streamer.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast for Samsung Smart TV you can browse the web and stream any web video, online movie, livestream or live tv show you want on your Samsung Smart TV. Mp4, m3u8, hls livestreams and also video-over-https are supported.\n \nThere is no time limit at all! You can watch videos of 2 minutes or 2 hours or even more. Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for link detection and send the video with a single tap to your Samsung Smart TV. The discovered link will be shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the Samsung App Store (Smart Hub) on your TV or Blu-ray Player, search for 'TV Cast' and install the receiver app.\n\n* Please enter the ip-adress of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your Samsung TV Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and other DRM protected videos like HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* Please use the Remote Playbar for video control while browsing (see more info below)\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> UPGRADE FEATURES (available as in-app purchases)\n\n* Premium Edition: Unlocks all of the features listed here. Also future features are included, so you do not have to pay for them when they are released in an updated app version. \n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all Samsung Smart TVs and Blu-ray Players. You can also use the included TV Remote for basic video control (play, pause, stop, forward and rewind videos) and navigating in Samsung Smart Hub. The TV Remote currently works on 2010 - 2013 TVs.\n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker: Blocks ads & popups on most websites and removes the sponsoring ads from the app. You can update and enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Samsung or any other trademark mentioned here."

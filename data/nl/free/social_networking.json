      "label": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nApple Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

To offer the widest range of features and up-to-date technology the app has been updated more than 60 times in the past 3 years and we will continue to do so.\n\nYou only need to scan a QR code and then you can:\n\n- access all of your WhatsApp chats (and group chats)\n- enjoy VOICE MESSAGES (SEND + RECEIVE)\n- reply to chats via KEYBOARD, QUICK REPLIES, DICTATION and SCRIBBLE\n- use a VARIETY of different KEYBOARD LAYOUTS*\n- watch VIDEOS\n- see STATUS UPDATES (TEXT, PICTURE, VIDEO)\n- view STICKERS and HD PICTURES (and ZOOM into them in native resolution)\n- CUSTOMIZE your quick replies\n- start a new chat right from the Watch\n- set each chat's font size\n- …\n\n... all with full respect to your privacy, WatchChat does not collect any personal data.\n\n*The currently supported keyboard layouts are:\n\n- FlickType (English)\n- ABC (English, Deutsch, Español, Português, אבגדה, Ελληνικά, Suomi, русский)\n- QWERTY (English, Español, Italiano)\n- QWERTZ (Deutsch)\n- AZERTY (Français)\n- אבגדה)עברית)\n\n\n\nSetting up the app for the first time only takes 4 simple steps:\n\n- open the app on your Apple Watch\n- open WhatsApp\n- in WhatsApp, go to (Settings) > (Linked Devices / WhatsApp Web) > (Link a device)\n- scan the QR code that will appear on your Apple Watch after 10-30 seconds\n- if a popup comes up, just try again, it will work out eventually :)\n\n\nAs this is a 3rd-party-app, I would really appreciate if you had suggestions for further development so I can take your ideas into consideration. If you encounter issues while using the app, don't hesitate to contact me, I am more than happy to help.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that, as the app isn’t officially affiliated with WhatsApp, available features and functionality are subject to change. To keep up with everything, the app has been updated more than 70 times since its release in 2017 - I am always looking for ways to offer new features or improve the existing ones.\n\n\nYou can use the app for free forever, but if you want to support the app's further development, the \"Support WatchChat Development\" subscription CAN be purchased for free users to access the \"Contacts\" and \"Status\" sections and will grant access to future additions. After the free trial period, if offered, the subscription automatically renews with the price and duration given in the purchase button unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. YOU CAN MANAGE AND CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS BY GOING TO YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE APP STORE AFTER PURCHASE. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\n\nAs of January, IF you want to sign up for the subscription, the free trial period is 3 days, it is billed annually and the price is about the equivalent of 3 USD.\n\n\nTerms of use: https://watchchat.info/terms.html"

You may have millions of followers on the platform, but it is impossible to track them all, and the native Instagram app does not provide any feature that keeps track of the followers that unfollow after some time. \n\nThe easiest way to find out who unfollowed you on Instagram is to track the exact number of followers and specific users manually. If you notice that your number of followers is decreasing, you can examine those specific users' Following lists to see if they are still following you. \n\nObviously, this is impractical and very time-consuming work, especially when you have a lot of followers who are constantly changing. It's much better to use an Insta tracker tool specializing in tracking your followers and unfollowers.\n\nIf you want to use an Insta Tracker & Insta Reports app that will help you to show you who followed and unfollowed you, who liked your photos and videos, or who unfollowed you by easy analytics, you are in the right place. We are here to help you! \nDownload and enjoy."

Whether it's your closest friends planning casual get-togethers or larger groups attending public events, this is your place to plan it all. NOW is used as a tool for the everyday to remind people of the simple pleasures and what keeps us present. \n\nSome features to mention:\nCreating your clique - A clique is a group of people who come together based on common interests and the desire to hang out with one another. There are no right or wrong ideas - the clique is yours and the community will follow. \nOpening hangouts - Hangouts are events that get published in a clique, bringing everyone together in real-life. For example, create a volleyball clique and open a hangout to arrange a game. The clique will then be notified to join in. \nCreating lineups - Use lineups to share places you’ve been and discover others.  Lineups are personalized lists people create to share their favorite spots and save places to visit. \n\nAfter downloading the app, it's time to create your first clique and invite your friends to join! \n\nFeel free to reach out to us at info@nowhangouts.com with any questions, suggestions, or feedback you have! \n\nThink offline, think NOW."

      "label": "なぜ、next zenly \"whoo\"を作ったのか\n\nみなさん、こんにちは。\n今日この日にwhooを正式にローンチできて嬉しく思います。\n\nこれまでの期間、一緒にテストプレイをしてくれたみんなにも感謝がいっぱいです。\n私たちは、zenlyに似たそっくりなアプリを作っています。\n\n早速アプリが気になる子はチェックしてみてください。\n\nただ、私たちはzenlyよりも良いアプリを作るために、活動しています。\nなぜwhooを作ろうと思ったかは、私がzenlyが大好きだからです。\n\n私たちのチームはこれまで、10個以上のアプリを作ってきました。\nその中の一つは、Ninjar/ニンジャーというアプリです。\n使ってくれてる子はわかると思いますが、zenlyをリスペクトしてデザインされています。\n\n先ほど、zenlyを超えると言いましたが、そんなに簡単なことではないと思っています。\nしかしリスペクトがあるので、zenlyの真似をするなら、それを超えるものを作らないといけないと思っています。\n新時代、新世代という言葉がありますが、それはどれも先代を超えてそう呼ばれています。\n\nなので、whooはzenlyに代わり、次の位置情報共有アプリになっていくことをここに宣言します。\n\nここで少し、位置情報共有アプリの歴史を話したいと思っています。\n\n安心してください、校長先生のように話は長くないですし、物理の先生のように小難しい話をするつもりはありません。\nzenlyが誕生する前から、位置情報共有アプリは常にトレンドで、多くのアプリがありました。\n\nただ、zenly以外はどれもうまくいってはいません。\n\nそれはなぜか？\n\n答えは簡単です。\n\nストーカーアプリのように見えるからです。\n\nいま多くのzenlyに似たアプリがあります。\nどれもzenlyと同じ、友達や家族の現在地がわかるアプリになっています。ただ、そこには楽しさはありません。\n\nただ、確認するだけ、それだけのもの。\nそれではストーカーアプリと何も変わりません。\n\nzenlyが無くなったから、位置情報が確認できればなんでも良いという話ではなく、zenlyが7年かけて作ってきたものはそんな簡単で安いものではないです。\n\nzenlyを使ってて、感じることはなかったですか？\n\nなんかこのアプリ楽しいぞ。\n\nこれが大切なのです。\nそして、whooにも楽しい要素をたくさん用意しています。\n\n既にプレイしてる人は気付いていませんか？\nwhooは他のアプリと違います。\n\n他のストーカーアプリとは違います。\n\nzenlyと同いところを見ています。\n楽しさを追求しています。\n\nそれはwhooのデザインから感じませんか？\nデパートのオモチャコーナーにいるような、そんなワクワクする気持ちになれるアプリを作っています。\n\nはじめるのは今からでも遅くありません。\nアプリは非常にシンプルで、クールで優しいです。\n\nそれでは、whooで会いましょう。\nあなたにとって良い日になりますように。\n\n\n後書き…\nテストに参加してくれた皆さん。\nありがとう！\nここで改めて、お礼を言わせてください。\nあなたたちの協力があり、良いアプリができました。\nこれからも開発は続きますし、私たちはみんなのことを忘れません。\nいや、忘れたくありません。\n忘れない印に目印のようなものをアプリ内に実装しました。\nヒントは、アプリのアイコン変更ボタンの辺りです。\n色々触って、このヒントから答えを見つけてください。\n\nteam whoo"

      "label": "Tumblr. Pure effervescent enrichment. Old internet energy. Home of the Reblogs. All the art you never knew you needed. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up. \n\nOh, and influencers? Don’t even go here. Every video you find, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate, every waterfall GIF you secretly gaze at in wonder—that’s all you. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Welcome to weird. Make it yours. \n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is. \n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. Tumblr is the home of all things weird and wonderful, funny and fascinating—old-school internet vibes. We’re built a little different, just like everyone else who goes here.\n\nYour dashboard will become the place to see what you want to see: a chronological tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, reblog and add your own take, this is your universe to discover, express, and enjoy. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here.\n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world, F1 fanfic that your mutuals need to see—you have so many options. Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. You can make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. Don’t say we don’t spoil you!\n\nThe reblog starts conversations in which anyone can join. Reblogging creates jokes and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post only for a couple of your friends to engage with? All possible here). No matter who you are, where you are, or what you are (looking at you here, Pikaman), this is your space—with as much freedom or privacy as you need. \n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. Maybe you have a favorite blorbo from your show? There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3, *and* see their OC art on Tumblr, *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? You get the idea: it’s all here. Wait. Frogs. Did we mention the frogs? \n\nIt’s a whole world out here. If the prospect of reblogging, shipping, curating, and fanart feels a little daunting, or you simply require a refresher on how all this works, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart’s content. Or simply drift through the dream you’ve created for yourself—a chronological dashboard curated by you. For you. You hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service"

      "label": "Free-roam areas for dogs, dog walks, find lost dogs, get help and advice from other dog owners, the DoggyDating app is like a Swiss army knife for dog owners. DoggyDating is the largest dog community in the Benelux with more than 100.000 downloads. In 2019 we have completely redesigned the app. Based on the experience of the last 5 years, the existing functionality has been improved. In addition we have added some wonderful new functions.\n\nFree-roam areas - DoggyDating provides the most complete overview of all free-roam areas for dogs in the Netherlands. In addition to a description, photo's and characteristics of the areas you will find reviews and you can store your favorite free-roam areas.\n \nDoggyDates - Dog owners can arrange dog walks with other dog owners. Every owner can create a DoggyDate, for which other owners will receive an invitation. You can also join DoggyDates created by others that you find in a searchable list or on the map. This is an excellent way to let your dog socialize and go on a fun outing for dog and owner!\n\nDoggyAlert - A DoggyAlert is like an Amber Alert for dogs. It is the greatest fear of every dog owner to have their dog run away or get lost. In that case you can immediately create a DoggyAlert. All DoggyDating app users in the vicinity of the location where you have lost your dog will receive a notification with the information of the lost dog and the location where is has last been seen. When someone sees or catches your dog they can let you know by sending you a message with the location of the dog. A wonderful way for dog owners to help eachother out! Of course DoggyDating users will get notified when the lost dog has been found again so they can stop searching.\n\nDoggyAssist - A place for dog owners to ask others for help or advice. DoggyAssists are organized in 6 categories: Request help, Request advice, Trainingsbuddy, Dogsitter, Tips and others. A wonderful way to help and support eachother!\n \nDoggyDiscount - In this section you can find all kinds of special offers and interesting discounts.

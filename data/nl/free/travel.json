      "label": "9292 travels with 2 million travellers every month\nThanks to the travel planner of 9292, you can plan all your trips with the train, bus, metro, tram, and ferry. Need to travel by bicycle, electric bicycle / scooter or a rental bike? We can include that in your travel advice. Enter your trip from A to B and we will immediately show you up-to-date travel information for all public transport in the Netherlands. And the app is prepared for showing Flex-OV such as the watertaxi in Rotterdam. In case of any changes, we will show you an alternative travel advice automatically. The up-to-date public transport planner provides live public transport info for NS, Arriva, Connexxion, Breng, Hermes, Keolis, RRReis, Qbuzz, EBS, U-OV, RET, HTM, GVB and Waterbus.\n\nE-ticket for the entire journey\nYou can buy e-tickets straight from the travel advice in the 9292 app. The affiliated public transport services for bus, tram, metro and ferry are Breng, Connexxion, EBS, Hermes, HTM, Keolis, RET, U-OV and Waterbus. For all national trains, these are NS, Blauwnet, Qbuzz, Connexxion, Arriva and Keolis.\n\nMusic on the go\nPlan your journey in the 9292 app. At the bottom of the travel advice of your choice you will see the button \"Playlist for this trip\". This will take you to the Playlist Generator. On this page we create a playlist based on the travel time of your chosen travel advice. Log in to your Spotify account and we place the created playlist in the library of your Spotify account, so that you can easily find it and enjoy your music during your trip.\n\nOccupancy expectation\nDuring these times, it is important to take into account how crowded the train, bus, tram or metro service is for your travel plans. The 9292 app displays the expected occupancy per mode of transport for each travel advice, as communicated to us by the transport services.\n\nBicycle pre- and post-journey\nUnder ‘Options’, you can indicate if you want to walk, cycle or ride a scooter at the start or end of  your trip. This will give you the most complete advice with all relevant information for travelling from A to B. You can also opt for an electric bicycle or rental bicycle. To make it even easier, we also show you bicycle rental locations if you select bicycle. Very useful for covering the last bit to your final destination!\n\nFrom/to\nThe app has multiple options for selecting your location of departure or arrival: your ‘current location’ (via GPS), a known location (shopping mall, station or attraction), an address or bus stop, your contacts, and even your frequently or recently used locations.\n\nUnique starting screen\nEnter your favourite locations and routes on the starting screen by using the plus-sign. This turns the 9292-app into your own personal app for quickly planning your trip from A to B, without needing an account. You can also add a bus stop or station you frequently use to your starting screen this way. Now you will always have access to the up-to-date departure times of that stop.\n\nSave travel advice\nWant to save a specific travel advice? You can! Simply use the plus-sign in the top right corner of the travel advice. You can find your saved travel advice by using the menu in the app.\n\nRoute on the map\nThe travel advice shows you a map with the route of that advice. Press on this and you will see the travel advice step by step on a detailed map. Now you can swipe through your entire trip!"

      "label": "De ANWB Eropuit app is een handige gids om eropuit te gaan in Nederland. Van fiets- en wandelroutes tot uitjes, je vindt hier volop inspiratie en informatie. \n\nFiets of wandel bijvoorbeeld één van de kant-en-klare ANWB fiets- en wandelroutes in Nederland of kies één van de Leden voor Leden wandel of fietsroutes, speciaal voor en door leden. Of maak eenvoudig je eigen fiets of wandel knooppunt route.\n\nOnderweg krijg je tips voor leuke adresjes om te pauzeren.  Bovendien biedt de app exclusieve ledenvoordelen voor dagjes uit, theaterproducties, stedentrips, fiets- en wandelaccessoires en meer. Inclusief handige mogelijkheid om schade of diefstal te melden voor leden met de ANWB Blijven Fietsen Verzekering. \n\n• Kies één van de meer dan 1000 kant-en-klare wandel- en fietsroutes in Nederland. Navigeer via de app naar het beginpunt en beleef de route. In de app zie je precies waar je bent.\n\n• Exclusief ledenvoordeel. Je vindt ledenvoordelen voor dagjes uit, theaterproducties, stedentrips, fiets- en wandelaccessoires en meer.\n\n• Speciaal voor ANWB leden; het tweede kopje koffie of thee gratis bij ANWB Gastvrijpunten, *na bestelling van een kopje koffie of thee met taart of een broodje.\n\n• Maak zelf een fietsroute in de knooppuntenplanner.  Als ANWB-lid kun je de route bewaren in jouw Mijn ANWB-account voor een volgende keer.\n\n• Onderweg pauzeren? Op basis van je locatie vind je tips voor leuke adresjes en ledenvoordelen bij ANWB Gastvrijpunten in de omgeving.\n\n• Log in met je persoonlijke Mijn ANWB-account en je hebt je digitale ANWB-ledenpas altijd bij de hand. Zo hoef je geen los pasje mee te nemen en heb je snel toegang tot je gegevens.\n\n• Band lek, accu leeg? Meld eenvoudig en snel pech: de app geeft je exacte locatie door aan de Wegenwacht, zodat die snel ter plaatse kan zijn, ook als er even geen straatnaambordje in de buurt staat (alleen voor leden met Wegenwacht Fiets Service).\n\n• Blijven Fietsen verzekering. Meld diefstal van je fiets eenvoudig via de app en zet met één druk op de knop het opsporingsteam aan het werk (alleen voor leden met een ANWB Blijven Fietsen Fietsverzekering).\n\n\nOver ANWB\n\nANWB is er voor jou, onderweg en op je bestemming. Met persoonlijke hulp, advies en informatie, ledenvoordeel en belangenbehartiging. Dat zie je ook terug in onze apps! Probeer ook eens een van de andere ANWB apps.\n\n\nANWB apps in het verkeer\n\nLaat je niet afleiden in het verkeer door je smartphone. Bedien deze app dus niet terwijl je fietst, maar stap even af op een veilige plek.\n\n\nZelf fiets of wandel routes maken in de app\n\nHet is ook mogelijk om via knooppunten zelf een fiets en wandel route te maken in de app. Dat gaat heel simpel. Als je de ANWB Eropuit app opent, zie je in het scherm ‘Maak je eigen route’. Je krijgt dan alle knooppunten te zien rondom de plek waar je op dat moment bent. Als je klaar bent, kun je de route opslaan (alleen voor leden) en/of direct gaan fietsen of wandelen."

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

      "label": "The most-used e-scooter sharing app in Europe. Travel quickly whenever you want through the city on an electric shared scooter. Find a felyx e-scooter in your neighbourhood, book it and activate it through the app and off you go!  \n \n\nFelyx e-scooter sharing is now available in more than 10 cities in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Groningen, Brussels, Berlin, Hamburg and many more! \n\nThe benefits of the felyx e-scooter app: \n\n● Reserving: snag it. You can book an e-scooter for free for up to 10 minutes, after which you pay €0.15 per extended minute.  \n\n● Smart radar function: get a notification when a shared scooter becomes free in your area. \n\n● Earn free riding minutes: invite your friends and receive 15 free minutes of riding per registered friend.  \n\n● Parking mode: would you like to park the felyx e-scooter for a while, but not run the risk of someone else renting it? Use the parking mode and keep the shared scooter for €0.10/min (NL) or €0,13 p/m (DE) and €0.15 p/m (BE). \n\n● Smartphone charger: charge your smartphone while you ride. Use the USB port and your own USB cable as soon as the e-scooter is activated.  \n\n● Battery status: overview of the battery capacity of each e-scooter before you book. \n\nHow does the felyx e-scooter sharing app work? \n\n1. Register in just a few minutes \n\nSimply register with the practical driver's license verification system in the app. Add your payment information and you're ready to ride.  \n\n2. Finding & renting \n\nUse the app to find a felyx scooter near you and make a reservation at the push of a button. \n\n3. Activate & off you go! \n\nActivate the e-scooter in the app and ride anywhere within the service area quickly and carefree. We make sure batteries are full and maintenance is taken care of. \n\n4. Parking & locking \n\nArrived safe? Park properly in the service area and end the rental via the app. No-hassle payment, minutes ridden are automatically debited from your bank account.  \n\n\nFrequently asked questions about felyx e-scooter sharing: \nWhat do you do regarding the hygiene of a felyx e-scooter? \nBoth e-scooters and helmets are cleaned and disinfected on a daily basis. All e-scooters capable of going 45 km/h are equipped with helmets and hairnets.  \n\nI don't live in a city with felyx, can I hire an e-scooter? \nYes, you can! Registering is quick and easy. Just choose the city you are planning to make your first ride \n\nWhat does felyx cost? \nWith felyx, you only pay for what you use. In the Netherlands and Belgium, you pay from €0.25/min and in Germany you’re paying from €0.18/min \n\nAt the moment, you don't pay any registration fee, but we do charge unlock fee of €0.50 per ride. \n\nDo I need a driver's license and if so, what type? \nClass B (which also allows you to drive a car), class A or a moped license (class AM). \n\nCan I drive and park outside a service area? \nYou can drive the felyx e-scooter outside the green marked areas in the app. However, activating and ending the rental is only possible within those green areas. It is possible to use the parking mode outside the service area at €0.10 p/m (NL), €0,13 p/m (DE) and €0.15 p/m (BE). The service area for a given city can be found on our website and on the map in the app. Make sure you park the felyx e-scooter properly: do not block the pavement for pedestrians, wheelchairs and prams. \n \nAbout felyx e-scooter sharing \nWe are a Dutch scale-up with ambitious plans for sustainable suburban transport. Want to know more about us? Do you have suggestions or ideas? Send us an e-mail (klantenservice@felyx.nl) or visit our website."

Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries.

With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

As you level up, you’ll unlock perks and partner deals such as Bonus Reservation Time and Hourly Rates, VIP Customer Support, a Birthday Voucher and Overnight Reservation. We’ve partnered with like-minded companies to bring you special offers from those who care as much as we do about sharing. SHARE NOW Rewards is completely free to join.\n\n• INVITE FRIENDS\nInvite friends by sending them a personal code via messenger apps, such as WhatsApp, or via email or SMS. If they sign up using your promo code, you'll each earn free driving credits - it’s a win-win!\n\n\nEnjoy the largest electric car-sharing fleet in Europe with SHARE NOW.

I go through all the comments, one by one, so that you can get better flight deals. \n\nWhat you can do with my app:\n\n•        Get cheap flight tickets\n•        Plan your trip ahead\no        Choose your seat\no        Order your meal beforehand\no        Buy additional luggage\no        Book your hotel room\no        Rent a car\no        Buy Fast Track\n•        Gift flight tickets with Gift Card\n•        Become a member of BolBol, my loyalty program\n•        Collect BolPoints, my flight points \n\nNo doubt that these are not the only things you can do with the app of “The Digital Airlines of Turkey.” You can find out more when you download my app.... Hearing about me is not enough, you have to experience me, dear!\n\nFAQ \n\nLet's go through the questions you are dying to know about me, flights bookings, cheap flights, flight deals, and much more…\n\nHow can I auto-fill my passenger information?\n\nYou'll need a BolBol account first. If you're not a member yet, you can easily sign up. You have to be signed in to your BolBol account to auto-fill your information.  \n\nIf you want to buy a flight ticket for another person, you need to go to User Settings and create a new profile for that person through \"\"My Contacts\"\" tab. Fill out the information for once and then save. This way you can buy flight tickets faster next time! \n\nHow can I save my credit card information?\n\nGo to your User Settings and find Saved Cards tab. Here you can safely manage, save, change or delete any of your cards. By saving credit card information, you won't need to fill out your card information and choose one of your saved cards faster when you are buying your next ticket. All of your information is protected in our secure database. \n\nAlso, you can save your card information at the Checkout screen and use the saved information to buy your next cheap flight ticket.\n\nAfter the last update, the app doesn't open or respond. What should I do?\n\nUnfortunately, I have to update my app to make it better and fix known issues. My app will be guiding you through the update processes so that you can use the most recent version.\n\nBonus \n\nHow can I get the cheapest flight tickets?\n\nFirst, you can download my app to help me alert you for flight deals of Pegasus Airlines.\n\nAt flight finder screen you can filter tickets by price, so you can choose the most suitable flight for yourself. \n\nAlso, you can plan your trip in advance and find the cheapest flight tickets on my app.\n\n***\n\nThat's all for now!

      "label": "Даже если ваш ребенок только начинает учиться читать и первый раз видит буквы. Или если ваш ребенок знает буквы и перед вами стоит задача объяснить ему, как их превратить в слова. Или у вас уже почти читающий дошкольник, которому надо подтянуть и закрепить навык. Во всех этих случаях вам подойдет ЧИТАНИЯ.\n\nПотому что это увлекательное путешествие героев по волшебной стране, с приключениями и миссией – спасти ее от злого волшебника. А справится с ним сможет тот, кто умеет читать!Ребенку интересно играть и проживать эту историю. Вместе с вовлекающим сюжетом в приложение встроен весь необходимый для освоения чтения материал. Начиная от букв до чтения фраз – все есть в ЧИТАНИИ.\n \nЗа время игры ребенок увидит, услышит и напишет:\n● более 500 иллюстрированных и озвученных слов \n● прочитает и отгадает 65 загадок\n● прочитает 68 поговорок\n● сыграет в 35 игр, развивающих различные навыки чтения \n● пройдет 30 тематических экранов долины Слов с разными уровнями сложности\n● начертит буквы 330 и более раз (печатный и прописной вариант)\n\nВы уже пробовали учить ребенка читать? Если да, тогда вы знаете, как это трудно. Ребенок путает буквы и звуки. Не может прочитать слово, хотя знает буквы, не может прочитать фразу, не понимает смысла.Теряет интерес...\nДля усвоения нужна тренировка. Именно этим занимается ваш ребенок в ЧИТАНИИ. Каждая из 35 мини-игр доводит нужный навык до автоматизма, а интересный сюжет способствует тому, что ребенок снова и снова возвращается в ЧИТАНИЮ и играет на новых, более сложных уровнях.\n\nВ ЧИТАНИИ 5 локаций – буквы, письмо, склады и «автоматизация чтения» – беглое чтение слов, фраз. Информация подана всеми возможными для восприятия способами – визуальным, аудиальным, игровым. Ребенок запоминает увиденное, развивает внимательность и наблюдательность. Улучшает речь за счет развития фонематического слуха и складового написания слов.\n\nОдна из трудностей у детей, когда они учатся читать – слияние букв в слова. Это объяснено в приложении анимацией и игрой. \n\nВ ЧИТАНИИ используется складовая методика обучения чтению (кубики Зайцева). Ее особенность в том, что ребенок быстро начинает читать, запоминая структурные единицы слов – склады. Чтение по складам отрабатывается в ЧИТАНИИ в локации «город Складов»\n\nПосле того, как ребенок освоил буквы и склады, важно как можно больше читать. Практика важна каждый день. В ЧИТАНИИ ребенок читает постоянно, начиная с простых слов. Постепенно сложность увеличивается, но ребенок прочтет все 500 слов, распределенных по темам и заданиям. Кроме обязательного материала, для прочтения в игре доступно более 3000 слов.\n\nЧИТАНИЯ – игра длительного прохождения. Обычно путь ребенка к вершине чтения и победе над злым волшебником занимает от месяца до года. У каждого ребенка свой путь и время. Не торопите события, лучше понаблюдайте, как он проходит игру. Порадуйтесь его успехам!\n\nУникальный обучающий алгоритм ЧИТАНИИ анализирует успехи ребенка, подбирает подходящий уровень заданий и игр. Поэтому, хотя оптимальный возраст для игры 4-6 лет, многие задания будут по силам даже трехлетнему малышу, который только начинает учиться читать, и заинтересуют семилетнего, кому надо подтянуть чтение перед школой. Для продвинутого уровня в настройках можно открыть сразу все разделы игры.\n \nПриложение без встроенных покупок, рекламы и не требует постоянного подключения к Интернету.\n \n● ЧИТАНИЯ - победитель Всероссийского конкурса «Позитивный контент» 2018 г. в номинации «лучшее мобильное приложение»,\n● По заключению Роскачества, ЧИТАНИЯ — лучшая образовательная игра, которая учит чтению, среди всех исследованных приложений на платформе iOS\n● №1 в обзоре SE7EN «5 лучших приложений из App Store для обучения дошкольника чтению»,\n● вошла в топ лучших iOS приложений, публикуемый журналом Лайфхакер.\n\nПрошла пора, когда ребенка надо было заставлять учиться читать. Когда вы придумывали, как же заинтересовать его. \nЧИТАНИЯ увлечет вашего ребенка сказочным сюжетом и научит его читать так, что он полюбит чтение. Попробуйте!"

      "label": "With the help of the Tijdsteekproef, a behaviour observation tool, teachers, school counselors and other educational professionals are able to measure the task orientation of his or her students, in both primary and secondary education. The measurement will take 20 minutes; every 20 seconds there will appear 5 options on your screen (task oriented, wandering, walking, disturbing and other). You select one; describing the student’s behaviour at that exact moment. The observation will be stopped right after the 20 minutes have passed. Next, you will get the results of your observation as a circular histogram with percentages. In case you are not able to observe a student for the full 20 minutes, you can always pause the measurement and decide to stop the observation or continue a few minutes later. Finally you will be able to send yourself the results in a well structured report by email. \nBy using this app you won’t be needing paper forms or extra time to get a clear overview of the results. The Tijdsteekproef will provide you with a clear overview of the results of all your students, completely online!"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Crazy Gears is a new-aged digital puzzle game, designed with a real mechanical engine and with children's critical thinking skills in mind! Hours of fun guaranteed for everyone who is up for the challenge, yes, even you Mom & Dad!\n\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2015 ***\n*** Parent's Choice Gold Winner Fall 2015***\n*** App of the week by Fun2Tap ***\n*** Best of the Best by Best Apps For Kids ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n\n\nABOUT CRAZY GEARS\nExplore a captivating digital playground in this tantalizing puzzle game! Children manipulate gears, chains, rods, and pulleys, to pull themselves through each level, which teaches them how different mechanisms affect one another when constructing a machine. Each reasoning challenge was carefully designed to adhere to the theories of educational technology pioneer, mathematician, computer scientist, and designer of the first programming language for children, Seymour Papert.\n\n“The best use of games is to leverage their tendency to enhance learning”- Papert\nRecommended Ages 5-9 \n\nAs a child, Papert fell in love with gears. Their movement fascinated him in every way and inspired his career. Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

      "label": "BrainWorks provides kids with the sensory breaks they need to function their best!\n\nOccupational Therapists and other specialists often recommend “sensory breaks” to children with sensory processing disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorders, ADHD, ADD, learning disabilities, and typically developing kids who struggle with certain forms of sensory input.  Due to their sensory issues, these children often have difficulty remaining on task, engaging in social interactions, and may have frequent meltdowns. The pro-active use of sensory breaks can be a quick and effective way to prevent or minimize these issues. BrainWorks takes the guesswork out of what activities will be the most helpful to these children and allows parents and teachers to easily provide the much-needed sensory breaks! \n\nThe BrainWorks App comes fully loaded with over 200 sensory activities and more are being created on a regular basis. The app is fully customizable and is equipped with the following features:\n\n• Locations – the app provides different default activity lists for the following five locations: Home, School, Community, Desk/Table, and Clinic. Location can be removed if not needed and location names and images can be customized. \n• Sensory System Descriptions – After selecting his/her location, the child is asked to select how they are feeling by tapping the picture/title that best describes them at the moment: Just Right, Slow & Sluggish, Fast & Stressed, Fast & Hyper. For kids who are already familiar with the online version of BrainWorks or the physical BrainWorks products, a tachometer is next to each of the “Blue Guys” demonstrating the sensory speeds. The list of available activities will depend on the child’s sensory system selection. The sensory system descriptions and images are fully customizable.\n• Activity Lists – the app provides a default visual list (picture and title) of activities that may be available in each of the four locations. The adult caregiver can easily remove activities from each list based on equipment availability and appropriateness for the user. Within the Settings mode, adults can read a description of the activity and see what equipment is needed for each one. Many activities do not require any equipment at all.\n• Timer – the adult caregiver can determine the length of the sensory break (2 to 20 minutes). While using the app, the child will see a visual timer at the top of the screen counting down. The timer is optional and does not appear unless the adult selects it. \n• Custom Activities – The adult caregiver can add sensory activities to the app by giving it a title, adding a photo, and picking which lists it should appear on.\n\n* PLEASE NOTE: Set-up is required prior to use by a child. Adults should plan to spend 30 minutes customizing the app in order for the child (or children) to get the most out of it. \n\nThousands of kids are already using the research-based BrainWorks products in their classrooms and homes. The BrainWorks app was created to meet the demand for this product to be available anytime and anywhere!"

      "label": "Heb je net breuken gehad op school en begrijp je het concept niet zo goed? Dan is deze app voor jouw. \nMet deze app leer je de basis van breuken uitgelegd met behulp van figuren. Je leert eerst een breuk herkennen en leer je wat de noemer en teller van de breuk weergeven. \nAls je het herkennen van de breuk begrijpt dan leer je met deze app rekenen met breuken tot 1. Dit doet de app middels leuke figuurtjes die de breuken voorstellen.\n\nAls je all oefeningen hebt afgerond met drie sterren dan begrijp je het concept breuken en kun je plussommen en minsommen maken met breuken tot het getal 1.\n\nDe app bestaat uit drie boekjes met ieder 7 tot 9 oefeningen met instructies.\n\nDirect na afloop maar ook op een later tijdstip, kan de leerkracht/ouder elke oefening nalopen en alle antwoorden terughalen in de vorm van schermafdrukken. Op deze manier is het eenvoudig om de oefening samen te evalueren. Doordat de resultaten gekoppeld zijn aan de iTunes account is deze app ook geschikt voor gebruik in de klas die gebruik maken van gedeelde iPads.\n\nDeze app maakt onderdeel uit van de succesvolle educatieve app serie MagiWise, die samen met kinderen zijn gemaakt en ideaal zijn voor extra oefenen op school en thuis. De oefeningen zijn ook beschikbaar in de Basisschool app van MagiWise."

This is where this app comes in place. The app allows you to revise the most up to date exam questions in a fun and enjoyable way. \n\nOur app will help you achieve the Regulated Financial Planner Qualification by thoroughly revising. The app contains hundreds of up to date questions similar to the 2020/2021 exam questions. \n\nOur app has the ability to offer instant feedback and a final percentage score after every 10 questions completed.\n\nIn the progress section, the app will show you how much time you spent preparing for the exam and the progress that you are making.\n\nThe Targets section is designed to help you revise the questions answered wrong the first time, so you can increase the final score. \n\nAre you finding it hard to set a time for revision? \nOur app will remind you to revise every day if you set it and can send you a Question of the day as a notification every morning.\n\nThe pass mark of the exam is still to be set, depending on pilot\nexam results. However, it is anticipated that it will likely fall\nbetween 60% and 70%. We, therefore, recommend that\ncandidates should aim to achieve 75% - 80% when using this app.\n\nWhile using this app, users will investigate the:\n- Introduction to ESG\n- The ESG Market\n- Governance Factors\n- Environmental Factors\n- Social Factors\n- ESG Analysis, Valuation & Integration\n- Engagement & Stewardship\n- ESG Integrated Portfolio Construction & Management\n- Investment Mandates, Portfolio Analytics & Client Reporting\n \nWith all of these great ways to revise, it is almost impossible not to pass the ESG Exam."

      "label": "Om te leren lezen is het belangrijk dat de letters geautomatiseerd zijn. Dit kunt u thuis oefenen door letters te flitsen. Flitsen is een letter heel kort laten zien en deze meteen weten op te noemen, zonder na te hoeven denken. Met deze app kan je zelf kiezen welke letters je kind moet oefenen. Een handige app voor kinderen om de letters thuis en op school te oefenen.\n\nDe oefeningen: \n* Letters flitsen \n* Welke letter zie je? \n* Welke letter hoort bij het plaatje? \n* Welke letter hoor je?\n* Waar hoor je deze letter?\n* In welk woord lees je deze letter?\n\nLaat uw kind aan de slag gaan met deze leerzame app en uw kind zal spelenderwijs de letters automatiseren. Deze app is zowel voor kinderen die in groep 3 beginnen met letters leren, als voor kinderen in groep 2 die al interesse hebben in de letters en klanken. \n\nWanneer uw kind begint met het leren lezen in groep 3 kunt u in deze app zelf kiezen met welke letters uw kind aan de slag gaat door een lijst met letters samen te stellen. Zo kunt u thuis goed aansluiten bij de letters die uw kind op school aan het oefenen is. U ziet de letterkaarten in de klas van uw kind hangen (op de meeste scholen). Zo weet u welke letters uw kind aan het oefenen is op school.\n\nBekijk ook onze andere apps:\n* Letters leren lezen - juf Jannie\n* Leren lezen voor groep 3 - juf Jannie\n* Letters flitsen voor kinderen - Juf Jannie\n* Letters & cijfers met monsters\n* Leestrein - leer verhalen lezen\n* Letters leren schrijven\n* Taal en woordenschat boerderij\n* Taal en woordenschat – de zee\n* Taal en woordenschat 3 - seizoenen\n* Cijfers en getallen leren en tellen - Juf Jannie\n* Rekensommen automatiseren\n* Tafels oefenen – leren rekenen\n* Juf Jannie – klokkijken\n* Leer de dagen en maanden\n* Puzzels voor peuters en kleuters - Juf Jannie\n* Sudoku - een draken avontuur\n* Origami voor kinderen - leer vouwen met papier\n* Alfa Pi Pi (Oud-Grieks alfabet)\n* Touwfiguren maken (Ztringz)\n\nAl mijn apps bevatten eenmalige prijzen, dus geen abonnement.\n\nOver Juf Jannie Juf Jannie maakt educatieve apps voor kinderen die aansluiten op de lesstof van het basisonderwijs.  De oefeningen in de apps zijn dezelfde oefeningen als kinderen op school krijgen, maar nu oefenen ze spelenderwijs en krijgen ze direct te horen wat goed gaat en wat ze nog moeten oefenen.\n\nPrivacy Policy Juf Jannie ontwikkelt spellen voor kinderen en begrijpt hoe belangrijk privacy is door deze doelgroep. \nDe apps van Juf Jannie:\n* bevatten geen reclame.\n* bevatten geen in-app aankopen.\n* bevatten geen koppeling met sociaal media.\n* verzamelen of delen geen persoonlijke informatie.\n* bieden een informatiescherm voor ouders waarin alle apps van Juf Jannie te zien zijn."

When I moved to America, I wanted to be sure that I didn't lose my identity and my culture. After my first son was born, this became even more important to me as I want him to understand the importance of his heritage. I developed Arabic Alphabet so that adults and children alike could have a fun way to accurately learn the foundations of the language. I hope you enjoy it!\" —from the developer\n\nWe have finally added two in-app upgrades, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The Write feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n• The Quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Arabic Alphabet in no time!"

Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound.

Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "Rijprocedure B (personenauto)\n \nOm op een eenvoudige en doelmatige wijze de rijprocedure auto te raadplegen heeft VERJO de app rijprocedure B ontwikkeld. De app rijprocedure B is het ideale naslagwerk voor in het theorielokaal, de auto en onderweg.\n\nIn de app rijprocedure auto wordt het meest wenselijke rijgedrag (verkeerstaak) van automobilisten beschreven. Daarnaast wordt ook aandacht besteed aan defensief en sociaal rijgedrag, noodzakelijk voor een veilige deelname aan het verkeer. \n\nDe rijprocedure is de basis voor het praktijkexamen rijbewijs personenauto (B). De examinator ( CBR ) beoordeelt het rijgedrag van de examenkandidaat op basis van de rijprocedure. De rijprocedure B is in de eerste plaats bestemd voor de rij-instructeur en de examinator. Maar ook voor anderen kan de rijprocedure B nuttig zijn als naslagwerk.\n\nBij het samenstellen van de rijprocedure is er vanuit gegaan dat de lezer goede kennis heeft van de verkeerswetgeving en geldende exameneisen (opgesteld door de Minister Infrastructuur en Milieu).  De rijprocedure B is geen leerplan maar een beschrijving van de leerdoelen voor de kandidaat."

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

      "label": "\"Laminitis\" the iPhone App was created to provide horse owners with a practical tool to help monitor weather conditions in a way that can be used to warn when grazing on grass posses an increased risk to horses prone to laminitis.\n\nLocal weather conditions are monitored and are used to predict the rise and fall of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC's) in grass.  When the predicted NSC's increase, this is shown as a rise in risk.\n\nUnder extreme weather conditions grass can become stressed and in these circumstances significantly increase the risk of a horse becoming footy or suffering a laminitic episode.  When this type of weather pattern happens the risk gauge will rapidly increase to High and maintain this level until the NSC and grass stress levels are predicted to have lowered again.\n\nToday, laminitis is a huge problem for horses all over the world and is one of the most common causes of lameness.  With the help of this app as an educational tool it is hoped that fewer horses will suffer from this condition going forward.\n\nCurrent Coverage: United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland), Ireland, France, Belgium\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application is not intended as a replacement for correct animal husbandry or to replace veterinary advice, it's role is simply to act as an additional early warning tool to advise when grasses at the location you have selected are likely to be 'under stress' and therefore to have accumulated excess non-structural carbohydrates (NSC, i.e. sugars, starch or fructan) which could significantly increase the risk of a laminitic episode should it be grazed.\n\nThis app can give you a warning when the risk of grazing induced laminitis is rising or high. However, individual horses vary widely in their ability to tolerate fluctuations in NSC levels so what is safe for one horse may not be safe for another. In addition, grazing is only one risk factor for laminitis and you need also to be aware of the risks posed by other causes, including toxins, metabolic problems and sugar and starch levels in hard feed, which cannot be measured by this app."

De juiste antwoorden worden duidelijk uitgelegd. \n\nDE BESTE VOORBEREIDING: \nGebruik de testmodus om een echt examen te simuleren. De succes-meter laat zien hoeveel je nog moet oefenen om je theorie examen te halen. \n\nWAAR EN WANNEER JE MAAR WIL: \nHet maakt niet uit waar je bent; op school, in de trein, of thuis, met iTheory kun je altijd oefenen. \n\n\nDEEL MET JE VRIENDEN: \nSamen met je vrienden je theorie examen voorbereiden? Laat ze zien hoe goed je bent en deel je resultaten via Facebook en Twitter.\n\nDIT IS WAT JE KRIJGT MET ITHEORY \n================================\n\nLEERMODUS: \nIn de leermodus vind je alle vragen. De vragen zijn onderverdeeld in categorieën zodat je de categorieën die je moeilijk vindt, extra kunt oefenen. \n\nTESTMODUS: \nDe examens in de testmodus zien er net zo uit als de echte theorie examens.  Deze examens duren ongeveer 20-30 minuten en bestaan uit meerkeuzevragen, ja/nee vragen en invulvragen.  Na afloop van het examen zie je meteen of dat je geslaagd bent of niet. De vragen die je fout beantwoord hebt, krijg je samen met de juiste antwoorden en een duidelijke uitleg, meteen te zien zodat je die nog extra kunt oefenen.\n\nSUCCES: \nDe resultaten van elke test die je maakt, worden aan de succes-meter toegevoegd. Deze meter laat zien hoeveel je nog moet oefenen om je theorie examen te halen. \n\nTIPS: \nIn de iTheory App kun je alle belangrijke aanwijzingen, tips en hints terugvinden. In de App vind je ook veel tips om je op het rijexamen zelf voor te bereiden.\n\nHIGHSCORE: \nHeb je een hoge score behaald? Wij houden een lijst met highscores bij, dus stuur ons je resultaten!\n\nDeze App is niet gepubliceerd door het CBR.  Het CBR geeft zelf geen oefenmateriaal uit.\n\nWil je meer over iTheory weten, of heb je een technische vraag? Ga dan naar https://www.itheorie.ch"

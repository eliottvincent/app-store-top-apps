      "label": "Om te leren lezen is het belangrijk dat de letters geautomatiseerd zijn. Dit kunt u thuis oefenen door letters te flitsen. Flitsen is een letter heel kort laten zien en deze meteen weten op te noemen, zonder na te hoeven denken. Met deze app kan je zelf kiezen welke letters je kind moet oefenen. Een handige app voor kinderen om de letters thuis en op school te oefenen.\n\nDe oefeningen: \n* Letters flitsen \n* Welke letter zie je? \n* Welke letter hoort bij het plaatje? \n* Welke letter hoor je?\n* Waar hoor je deze letter?\n* In welk woord lees je deze letter?\n\nLaat uw kind aan de slag gaan met deze leerzame app en uw kind zal spelenderwijs de letters automatiseren. Deze app is zowel voor kinderen die in groep 3 beginnen met letters leren, als voor kinderen in groep 2 die al interesse hebben in de letters en klanken. \n\nWanneer uw kind begint met het leren lezen in groep 3 kunt u in deze app zelf kiezen met welke letters uw kind aan de slag gaat door een lijst met letters samen te stellen. Zo kunt u thuis goed aansluiten bij de letters die uw kind op school aan het oefenen is. U ziet de letterkaarten in de klas van uw kind hangen (op de meeste scholen). Zo weet u welke letters uw kind aan het oefenen is op school.\n\nBekijk ook onze andere apps:\n* Letters leren lezen - juf Jannie\n* Leren lezen voor groep 3 - juf Jannie\n* Letters flitsen voor kinderen - Juf Jannie\n* Letters & cijfers met monsters\n* Leestrein - leer verhalen lezen\n* Letters leren schrijven\n* Taal en woordenschat boerderij\n* Taal en woordenschat – de zee\n* Taal en woordenschat 3 - seizoenen\n* Cijfers en getallen leren en tellen - Juf Jannie\n* Rekensommen automatiseren\n* Tafels oefenen – leren rekenen\n* Juf Jannie – klokkijken\n* Leer de dagen en maanden\n* Puzzels voor peuters en kleuters - Juf Jannie\n* Sudoku - een draken avontuur\n* Origami voor kinderen - leer vouwen met papier\n* Alfa Pi Pi (Oud-Grieks alfabet)\n* Touwfiguren maken (Ztringz)\n\nAl mijn apps bevatten eenmalige prijzen, dus geen abonnement.\n\nOver Juf Jannie Juf Jannie maakt educatieve apps voor kinderen die aansluiten op de lesstof van het basisonderwijs.  De oefeningen in de apps zijn dezelfde oefeningen als kinderen op school krijgen, maar nu oefenen ze spelenderwijs en krijgen ze direct te horen wat goed gaat en wat ze nog moeten oefenen.\n\nPrivacy Policy Juf Jannie ontwikkelt spellen voor kinderen en begrijpt hoe belangrijk privacy is door deze doelgroep. \nDe apps van Juf Jannie:\n* bevatten geen reclame.\n* bevatten geen in-app aankopen.\n* bevatten geen koppeling met sociaal media.\n* verzamelen of delen geen persoonlijke informatie.\n* bieden een informatiescherm voor ouders waarin alle apps van Juf Jannie te zien zijn."

For each letter you will be able to:\n\n• See it in great detail.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its phonemes.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its name.\n• See and hear a common Arabic word which begins with that letter.\n\nArabic Alphabet is not only fun, but it's also accurate because it was developed by a native Arabic speaker, and all audio samples were recorded by a college professor of Arabic.\n\n\"I was born and raised in Morocco with Arabic as my language of origin. When I moved to America, I wanted to be sure that I didn't lose my identity and my culture. After my first son was born, this became even more important to me as I want him to understand the importance of his heritage. I developed Arabic Alphabet so that adults and children alike could have a fun way to accurately learn the foundations of the language. I hope you enjoy it!\" —from the developer\n\nWe have finally added two in-app upgrades, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The Write feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n• The Quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Arabic Alphabet in no time!"

Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

You select one; describing the student’s behaviour at that exact moment. The observation will be stopped right after the 20 minutes have passed. Next, you will get the results of your observation as a circular histogram with percentages. In case you are not able to observe a student for the full 20 minutes, you can always pause the measurement and decide to stop the observation or continue a few minutes later. Finally you will be able to send yourself the results in a well structured report by email. \nBy using this app you won’t be needing paper forms or extra time to get a clear overview of the results. The Tijdsteekproef will provide you with a clear overview of the results of all your students, completely online!"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Rijprocedure B (personenauto)\n \nOm op een eenvoudige en doelmatige wijze de rijprocedure auto te raadplegen heeft VERJO de app rijprocedure B ontwikkeld. De app rijprocedure B is het ideale naslagwerk voor in het theorielokaal, de auto en onderweg.\n\nIn de app rijprocedure auto wordt het meest wenselijke rijgedrag (verkeerstaak) van automobilisten beschreven. Daarnaast wordt ook aandacht besteed aan defensief en sociaal rijgedrag, noodzakelijk voor een veilige deelname aan het verkeer. \n\nDe rijprocedure is de basis voor het praktijkexamen rijbewijs personenauto (B). De examinator ( CBR ) beoordeelt het rijgedrag van de examenkandidaat op basis van de rijprocedure. De rijprocedure B is in de eerste plaats bestemd voor de rij-instructeur en de examinator. Maar ook voor anderen kan de rijprocedure B nuttig zijn als naslagwerk.\n\nBij het samenstellen van de rijprocedure is er vanuit gegaan dat de lezer goede kennis heeft van de verkeerswetgeving en geldende exameneisen (opgesteld door de Minister Infrastructuur en Milieu).  De rijprocedure B is geen leerplan maar een beschrijving van de leerdoelen voor de kandidaat."

      "label": "Даже если ваш ребенок только начинает учиться читать и первый раз видит буквы. Или если ваш ребенок знает буквы и перед вами стоит задача объяснить ему, как их превратить в слова. Или у вас уже почти читающий дошкольник, которому надо подтянуть и закрепить навык. Во всех этих случаях вам подойдет ЧИТАНИЯ.\n\nПотому что это увлекательное путешествие героев по волшебной стране, с приключениями и миссией – спасти ее от злого волшебника. А справится с ним сможет тот, кто умеет читать!Ребенку интересно играть и проживать эту историю. Вместе с вовлекающим сюжетом в приложение встроен весь необходимый для освоения чтения материал. Начиная от букв до чтения фраз – все есть в ЧИТАНИИ.\n \nЗа время игры ребенок увидит, услышит и напишет:\n● более 500 иллюстрированных и озвученных слов \n● прочитает и отгадает 65 загадок\n● прочитает 68 поговорок\n● сыграет в 35 игр, развивающих различные навыки чтения \n● пройдет 30 тематических экранов долины Слов с разными уровнями сложности\n● начертит буквы 330 и более раз (печатный и прописной вариант)\n\nВы уже пробовали учить ребенка читать? Если да, тогда вы знаете, как это трудно. Ребенок путает буквы и звуки. Не может прочитать слово, хотя знает буквы, не может прочитать фразу, не понимает смысла.Теряет интерес...\nДля усвоения нужна тренировка. Именно этим занимается ваш ребенок в ЧИТАНИИ. Каждая из 35 мини-игр доводит нужный навык до автоматизма, а интересный сюжет способствует тому, что ребенок снова и снова возвращается в ЧИТАНИЮ и играет на новых, более сложных уровнях.\n\nВ ЧИТАНИИ 5 локаций – буквы, письмо, склады и «автоматизация чтения» – беглое чтение слов, фраз. Информация подана всеми возможными для восприятия способами – визуальным, аудиальным, игровым. Ребенок запоминает увиденное, развивает внимательность и наблюдательность. Улучшает речь за счет развития фонематического слуха и складового написания слов.\n\nОдна из трудностей у детей, когда они учатся читать – слияние букв в слова. Это объяснено в приложении анимацией и игрой. \n\nВ ЧИТАНИИ используется складовая методика обучения чтению (кубики Зайцева). Ее особенность в том, что ребенок быстро начинает читать, запоминая структурные единицы слов – склады. Чтение по складам отрабатывается в ЧИТАНИИ в локации «город Складов»\n\nПосле того, как ребенок освоил буквы и склады, важно как можно больше читать. Практика важна каждый день. В ЧИТАНИИ ребенок читает постоянно, начиная с простых слов. Постепенно сложность увеличивается, но ребенок прочтет все 500 слов, распределенных по темам и заданиям. Кроме обязательного материала, для прочтения в игре доступно более 3000 слов.\n\nЧИТАНИЯ – игра длительного прохождения. Обычно путь ребенка к вершине чтения и победе над злым волшебником занимает от месяца до года. У каждого ребенка свой путь и время. Не торопите события, лучше понаблюдайте, как он проходит игру. Порадуйтесь его успехам!\n\nУникальный обучающий алгоритм ЧИТАНИИ анализирует успехи ребенка, подбирает подходящий уровень заданий и игр. Поэтому, хотя оптимальный возраст для игры 4-6 лет, многие задания будут по силам даже трехлетнему малышу, который только начинает учиться читать, и заинтересуют семилетнего, кому надо подтянуть чтение перед школой. Для продвинутого уровня в настройках можно открыть сразу все разделы игры.\n \nПриложение без встроенных покупок, рекламы и не требует постоянного подключения к Интернету.\n \n● ЧИТАНИЯ - победитель Всероссийского конкурса «Позитивный контент» 2018 г. в номинации «лучшее мобильное приложение»,\n● По заключению Роскачества, ЧИТАНИЯ — лучшая образовательная игра, которая учит чтению, среди всех исследованных приложений на платформе iOS\n● №1 в обзоре SE7EN «5 лучших приложений из App Store для обучения дошкольника чтению»,\n● вошла в топ лучших iOS приложений, публикуемый журналом Лайфхакер.\n\nПрошла пора, когда ребенка надо было заставлять учиться читать. Когда вы придумывали, как же заинтересовать его. \nЧИТАНИЯ увлечет вашего ребенка сказочным сюжетом и научит его читать так, что он полюбит чтение. Попробуйте!"

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

      "label": "\"Laminitis\" the iPhone App was created to provide horse owners with a practical tool to help monitor weather conditions in a way that can be used to warn when grazing on grass posses an increased risk to horses prone to laminitis.\n\nLocal weather conditions are monitored and are used to predict the rise and fall of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC's) in grass.  When the predicted NSC's increase, this is shown as a rise in risk.\n\nUnder extreme weather conditions grass can become stressed and in these circumstances significantly increase the risk of a horse becoming footy or suffering a laminitic episode.  When this type of weather pattern happens the risk gauge will rapidly increase to High and maintain this level until the NSC and grass stress levels are predicted to have lowered again.\n\nToday, laminitis is a huge problem for horses all over the world and is one of the most common causes of lameness.  With the help of this app as an educational tool it is hoped that fewer horses will suffer from this condition going forward.\n\nCurrent Coverage: United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland), Ireland, France, Belgium\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application is not intended as a replacement for correct animal husbandry or to replace veterinary advice, it's role is simply to act as an additional early warning tool to advise when grasses at the location you have selected are likely to be 'under stress' and therefore to have accumulated excess non-structural carbohydrates (NSC, i.e. sugars, starch or fructan) which could significantly increase the risk of a laminitic episode should it be grazed.\n\nThis app can give you a warning when the risk of grazing induced laminitis is rising or high. However, individual horses vary widely in their ability to tolerate fluctuations in NSC levels so what is safe for one horse may not be safe for another. In addition, grazing is only one risk factor for laminitis and you need also to be aware of the risks posed by other causes, including toxins, metabolic problems and sugar and starch levels in hard feed, which cannot be measured by this app."

You can also hold the AFD / AGC parameters by pressing the Lock button.\n* There will be a time lag of about 1 to 2 seconds for AFD tracking.\n* The Pro version also supports waterfall display.\n\n[Control parameters]\n1.Language select English and Japanese(KANA)\n2.Audio Input Level\n3.BPF ON/OFF\n4.BPF of Center Frequency\n5.BPF of Band Width\n6.BPF of Shape\n7.Notch ON/OFF\n8.Notch of Center Frequency\n9.CW Speed Control ON/OFF\n10.CW Speed Control Low, Mid1, Mid2 or High\n11.Delete All Decoded Text\n12.Realtime CW Signal Display\n13.Input signal recording function.\n14.Playback function from the file list.\n15.Support the Garbage Data reduction function\n\n[Note]\nSince the signal after BPF is output to the audio output, it can also be used as an AF-CW filter.\n\n[URL of this App(Free version)  working example video]\nThe GUI is slightly different, but the basic functionality is the same.\nhttps://youtu.be/Pwp7W4m-m34"

Net als in het echte theorie examen komen de thema’s gevaarherkenning, verkeersregels en verkeersinzicht aan bod. Na het beantwoorden van een vraag, krijg je niet alleen de juiste oplossing, maar ook een gedetailleerde uitleg. Een betere App om je voor te bereiden vind je niet!\n\nGEEN ONDUIDELIJKHEDEN: \nElke categorie bevat een groot aantal vragen. De juiste antwoorden worden duidelijk uitgelegd. \n\nDE BESTE VOORBEREIDING: \nGebruik de testmodus om een echt examen te simuleren. De succes-meter laat zien hoeveel je nog moet oefenen om je theorie examen te halen. \n\nWAAR EN WANNEER JE MAAR WIL: \nHet maakt niet uit waar je bent; op school, in de trein, of thuis, met iTheory kun je altijd oefenen. \n\n\nDEEL MET JE VRIENDEN: \nSamen met je vrienden je theorie examen voorbereiden? Laat ze zien hoe goed je bent en deel je resultaten via Facebook en Twitter.\n\nDIT IS WAT JE KRIJGT MET ITHEORY \n================================\n\nLEERMODUS: \nIn de leermodus vind je alle vragen. De vragen zijn onderverdeeld in categorieën zodat je de categorieën die je moeilijk vindt, extra kunt oefenen. \n\nTESTMODUS: \nDe examens in de testmodus zien er net zo uit als de echte theorie examens.  Deze examens duren ongeveer 20-30 minuten en bestaan uit meerkeuzevragen, ja/nee vragen en invulvragen.  Na afloop van het examen zie je meteen of dat je geslaagd bent of niet. De vragen die je fout beantwoord hebt, krijg je samen met de juiste antwoorden en een duidelijke uitleg, meteen te zien zodat je die nog extra kunt oefenen.\n\nSUCCES: \nDe resultaten van elke test die je maakt, worden aan de succes-meter toegevoegd. Deze meter laat zien hoeveel je nog moet oefenen om je theorie examen te halen. \n\nTIPS: \nIn de iTheory App kun je alle belangrijke aanwijzingen, tips en hints terugvinden. In de App vind je ook veel tips om je op het rijexamen zelf voor te bereiden.\n\nHIGHSCORE: \nHeb je een hoge score behaald? Wij houden een lijst met highscores bij, dus stuur ons je resultaten!\n\nDeze App is niet gepubliceerd door het CBR.  Het CBR geeft zelf geen oefenmateriaal uit.\n\nWil je meer over iTheory weten, of heb je een technische vraag? Ga dan naar https://www.itheorie.ch"

      "label": "SPECTRUMVIEW PLUS\n\nVisualise, in real time, the frequencies that you can hear around you and even those you cannot. SpectrumView provides a high-quality, real-time spectrogram and spectrum analyser display, with a configurable sample rate and frequency resolution for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. You can use this application to measure the highest tones you can sing, obtain visual feedback of the frequencies in your speech, identify an annoying sound, calibrate musical instruments and all sorts of acoustic analysis. \n\n·  Refresh Spectrogram. Allows users to refresh the spectrogram so that it clears the spectrogram that had already been displayed.\n·  Change min and max scale. Allows users to set their own minimum and maximum scale value on the spectrogram and spectrum analyser view, in both linear and log scale.\n·  Set Recording filename. Recording filenames are editable and the suffix can be set to have an  incremental value or date/time.\n·  Access recordings and snapshots using the \"Files\" app. To ease the complicated process of accessing recordings and data snapshots using iTunes, all the data can be easily accessible using the \"Files\" app that is available from iOS 11. \n·  Web File Transfer. Allows you to access your files from another device using a web browser.\n·  Logarithmic scale. Allows you to set either linear or logarithmic frequency scales in the Spectrogram and Spectrum Analyser views\n·  Peak hold. Allows you to freeze and hold the peaks of the frequency envelope (three holds in three distinct colours) in Spectrum Analyser mode\n·  Save location. Never forget where a clip was recorded – uses the devices location services\n·  Auto lock disabled. During playback and recordings auto lock is disabled to prevent the device from automatically locking (if enabled), for uninterrupted recording/playback\n·  Multiple selectable sample rates from 8,000 Hz to 48,000 Hz\n·  High-frequency resolution with configurable signal analysis window lengths or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) orders. \n·  Sound intensity represented using a colour spectrum scale from -96 dBFS to 0 dBFS. \n·  Frequency Pinch-to-Zoom. Allows you to zoom into the frequency space to look at a specific tone or frequency.\n·  Recording and Playback of Audio Files. Provides a fully functional audio recorder that allows you to record, pause and play back files in high-quality, uncompressed, wave format.\n·  Tap Data Cursor. Allows taps on any part of the Spectrogram or Spectrum Analyser display to obtain the exact frequency in Hertz (Hz) and level in decibels (dB) at that point.\n·  Musical Notes or Frequency Display on Tap. Selectable frequency or musical pitch notation to obtain the cent-accurate musical note e.g. A4 (22), when the display is tapped.\n·  Live Spectrogram and Spectrum Analyser Views of Recorded Files.  Files recorded can be played back and the Spectrogram and Spectrum Analyser modes can be used to review the audio.\n·  Sharing Recorded Files by Email or iTunes File-sharing.\n·  High Quality Screenshots.\n·  Soundcloud support.  Audio files can be uploaded to or downloaded from Soundcloud as well as being able to post audio to Facebook.\n·  Playback from iTunes library.  Files can now be analysed directly form the iTunes library.\n·  Fullscreen mode. Hide the menu at the bottom of the screen to get even more of the screen dedicated to frequency analysis.\n·  Selectable spectrogram colour scales. You can now select one of 7 colour scales for your spectrogram.\n·  Selectable window functions.  You can now see the window function options provided.\n·  Apply gain.  A maximum of 24dB gain can be applied to make ‘hard to see’ details easier to view.\n·  Open In.  Audio files can be directly opened in SpectrumView.

But Sanskrit is a very complex and demanding language, and in order to master it, one must memorise a great deal of information. This is where Liberation Philology Sanskrit can help.\n\nWhenever you have your phone and a free moment, Liberation Philology Sanskrit presents a continuous multiple-choice test on Sanskrit vocabulary and grammar. It immediately confirms or corrects each answer, and reinforces your knowledge through repetition.\n\n• Vocabulary: 320 levels, each testing the translation of ten words between Sanskrit and English. Interspersed among these are cumulative levels reviewing what has been learned earlier (giving a total of 360 levels).\n\n• Nouns: Tests your ability to parse and decline all classes of Sanskrit nouns.\n\n• Pronouns: Tests your ability to parse and decline Sanskrit pronouns.\n\n• Verbs: Tests your ability to parse and conjugate a wide range of Sanskrit verbs.\n\nAll three tests can be set to display Sanskrit words either in Devanagari script or transliterated into the Roman alphabet. A further Reference module allows you to review the vocabulary word-list and the noun and verb paradigms."

      "label": "Matrix Numerics is a powerful Numerical Linear Algebra app with a simple and user-friendly interface. It is designed to quickly present you Linear Algebra results involving matrices and vectors with the fewest taps possible. Matrix Numerics uses the SwiftLAN engine to approximate solutions to a linear system of equations, compute matrix decompositions and calculate vector dynamics. SwiftLAN is a powerful Linear Algebra framework developed by academics for the purpose of native Scientific Computation and Modeling in Swift. Its State-of-the-art Numerical algorithms take advantage of the expressiveness and lightning speed of the Swift programming language to deliver powerful performance and accuracy. Each algorithm in the framework is extensively researched, developed and debugged following closely the mathematical literature of authors like G. Golub, D.S Watkins, J.G.F Francis, C. Van Loan and many others. After development, all algorithms are written 100% in Swift and are intensively tested for speed and accuracy against MATLAB, Accelerate and the LAPACK++ library in C++. All of these aspects make Matrix Numerics a world class tool for scientists, students or any other person exposed to Linear Algebra no matter how early are they in their scientific/mathematical carries. These are some of the things you can do on Matrix Numerics:\n\n* Add, subtract, multiply matrices.\n* Inverse\n* Condition Number\n* Rank\n* Spectral Radius\n* Trace\n* Determinant \n* Transpose\n* Adjoint\n* Characteristic Polynomial\n* Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors\n* Singular Values\n* Singular Value Decomposition\n* Pseudoinverse\n* PLU Decomposition\n* Cholesky Decomposition\n* Gram-Schmidt Decomposition\n* QR Decomposition\n* Upper Hessenberg Decomposition \n* Real Schur Form Decomposition\n* Norms 1,2,Infinity and Frobenius.\n* Fundamental Subspaces\n\nWhen dealing with Vectors, Matrix Numerics can help you compute:\n\n* Inner Product\n* Cross Product\n* Projection Vector\n* Correlation between vectors\n* Angle between vectors\n* Vector Length\n* Vector Normalization\n* Vector Orthonormalization \n\nYou can also approximate solutions to Linear System of Equations and Linear Least Squares using the algorithm that best fits your system:\n\n* Ordinary Least Squares\n* Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares\n* Pseudoinverse by SVD\n* Kaczmarz’s Algorithm\n* PLU with Scaled Row Pivoting\n* Successive Over Relaxation \n* Conjugate Gradient \n* Gauss-Seidel Iteration\n* Jacobi Iteration\n\nIdentify specific attributes of your System/Matrix with a single touch:\n\n* Is it Singular?\n* Is it Symmetric?\n* Is it Positive Definitive?\n* Is it Diagonal?\n* Is it Upper or Lower Diagonal or both?\n* Is it Orthogonal?\n* Is it Convergent?\n* Is it Row or Column Diagonally Dominant or both?\n\nNumerical results and notations are beautifully rendered in a LaTeX-like style supporting both decimal and rational modes.

      "label": "We have all at one time or another had challenges in our daily communication. With this tool you become a skillful communicator. Here you train yourself in recognizing other people's behaviour patterns, which will be of great benefit in all future meetings. For example, how do you meet an introvert if you are an extrovert yourself? In what way can you separate factual issues from personal ones? How do you adapt more quickly to people around you and get what you want? You find the answers here. With the help of Surrounded by idiots, all interaction with others becomes both smoother and easier.\n\nThe app contains many areas of knowledge about different behaviours. You regularly test your skills through different types of quizzes and through concrete problem solving of different relationship challenges. In just a few minutes you can also do a simplified behavioural analysis of both yourself and others. Then you receive a recommendation on which strategy you should use towards different individuals. It cannot be more simple!\n\nThe content is easily accessible and entertaining, at the same time as you build real skills around how to handle everyone you meet from now on.\n\nSurrounded by idiots is for both you who are interested in yourself and your own personal development, and for you who are curious about how other people work - and why. Have you ever had trouble understanding people around you? Are you tired of poor communication and misunderstandings? Are you looking for tools to easier get along with others? Then this is the app for you.\n\nThe biggest benefit is that from day one you will increase your social skills. You will understand people around you in a completely different way. Your various interactions with people you meet will be seen in a whole new light. The amount of unnecessary conflicts will decrease, and you will more easily understand both your partner and – why not your boss. And, not least, they will understand you.\n\nThe app costs no more than a lunch but contains insights you will benefit from for years.\nIt is based on the best-selling book Surrounded by Idiots. And builds on the worldwide model with the four colours: red, yellow, green and blue. The fundamentals can be traced all the way back to Carl Jung."

Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

      "label": "Met deze app oefenen kinderen met klokkijken op een wijzerklok (analoge klok) en een digitale klok.\nKlokkijken valt onder rekenen. Op de basisschool wordt met behulp van de rekenmethode het klokkijken geleerd. Veel rekenmethoden gaan snel door deze leerstof.\nMet deze klokkijk app kunnen kinderen deze leerstof rustig op hun gemak extra oefenen.\n\nDe oefeningen in deze app zijn verdeeld in verschillende niveaus. \nDit geeft je een idee in welke volgorde kinderen op school leren klokkijken.\n\nDe oefeningen:\n\nLEVEL 1 (hele uren, halve uren, kwartieren en mix)\n* Hoe laat is het? Kies uit drie antwoorden. \n* Zet de klok op de juiste tijd.\n* Hoe laat is het? Noteer het juiste antwoord.\n* Op welke klok is het …. uur? Kies uit vier klokken.\n\nLEVEL 2 (hele uren, halve uren, kwartieren, 5 minuten, minuten en mix)\n* Hoe laat is het? Kies uit drie antwoorden. \n* Zet de klok op de juiste tijd.\n* Hoe laat is het? Noteer het juiste antwoord.\n* Hoe laat is het over ….. uur? Kies uit drie klokken.\n* Op welke klok is het …. uur? Kies uit vier klokken.\n* Zet de klok …… uur later.\n* Zet de vier klokken in de juiste volgorde.\n\nLEVEL 3 analoge klok en digitale klok (hele uren, halve uren, kwartieren, 5 minuten en mix)\n* Hoe laat is het? Kies uit drie digitale klokken. \n* Hoe laat is het? Kies uit drie getypte antwoorden.\n* Hoe laat is het? Noteer je antwoord in uren en minuten (net als bij een digitale klok!).\n* Zet de vier digitale klokken in de juiste volgorde.\n* Welke twee klokken horen bij elkaar? (analoge klok en digitale klok).\n\nLEVEL 4 analoge klok en digitale klok (hele uren, halve uren, kwartieren, 5 minuten en mix)\n* Hoeveel later is het (je ziet twee analoge klokken)? Noteer je antwoord in uren en minuten (net als bij een digitale klok!).\n* Hoe lang mag je spelen voor dit bedrag?\n* Hoeveel later is het (je ziet twee digitale klokken)? Noteer je antwoord in uren en minuten (net als bij een digitale klok!).\n* Hoe lang moet je nog wachten? (digitale tijden)\n\nHoe pak je het oefenen met klokkijken aan met behulp van deze app? \nGa met behulp van de app na wat je kind wel en (nog) niet beheerst. Start met het oefenen bij de onderdelen van het laagste niveau. Controleer eerst of je kind de hele en halve uren goed kan aflezen en daarna de kwartieren. Je kan er ook gelijk voor kiezen om “mix” te proberen bij de oefeningen. Vooral als je bijna zeker bent dat deze eerste drie onderdelen van de klok wel goed gaan is de optie “mix” de snelste optie om dit bij je kind te controleren.\nGaat dit allemaal goed? Dan kan je verder controleren bij de oefeningen van niveau 2. Hierbij komen de minuten aan bod. \nControleer daarna of je kind de tijd in de juiste volgorde weet te plaatsen en of je kind weet hoe laat het over een afgesproken tijd is (bijvoorbeeld een uur later).\nGaat het aflezen van de hele klok goed? Dan kan je kind bij niveau 3 oefenen met de digitale klok. Als het aflezen van beide klokken goed gaat kan je kind bij niveau 4 oefenen met tijdsbesef. \nTer informatie:\nGroep 3: Het streven is op school dat kinderen in januari (M3 niveau) de klok kunnen aflezen op het hele uur en het halve uur. Aan het einde van groep 3 wordt er steeds meer geoefend met de kwartieren.\nGroep 4: Kinderen leren de minuten van de klok af te lezen. Het is dan ook belangrijk dat de kinderen de hele uren, halve uren en de kwartieren al goed kunnen aflezen op de klok. Aan het begin van groep 4 leren de kinderen de vijf en tien minuten op de klok en aan het einde van groep 4 krijgen ze de hele klok aangeboden, dus ook drie over 5 (17:03 uur).\nGroep 5: Aan het begin van groep 5 wordt eerst de hele klok nog eens herhaald en daarna gaan de kinderen beginnen met de digitale klok. Eerst oefenen ze de hele uren, halve uren en de kwartieren. Aan het einde van groep 5 werken de kinderen met de hele analoge klok en hele digitale klok.\nVanaf groep 6: De kinderen werken verder aan tijdsbesef. Denk daarbij aan je dag planning. \n\nAl mijn apps bevatten eenmalige prijzen, dus geen abonnement."

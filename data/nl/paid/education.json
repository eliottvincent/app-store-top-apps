      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Here you train yourself in recognizing other people's behaviour patterns, which will be of great benefit in all future meetings. For example, how do you meet an introvert if you are an extrovert yourself? In what way can you separate factual issues from personal ones? How do you adapt more quickly to people around you and get what you want? You find the answers here. With the help of Surrounded by idiots, all interaction with others becomes both smoother and easier.\n\nThe app contains many areas of knowledge about different behaviours. You regularly test your skills through different types of quizzes and through concrete problem solving of different relationship challenges. In just a few minutes you can also do a simplified behavioural analysis of both yourself and others. Then you receive a recommendation on which strategy you should use towards different individuals. It cannot be more simple!\n\nThe content is easily accessible and entertaining, at the same time as you build real skills around how to handle everyone you meet from now on.\n\nSurrounded by idiots is for both you who are interested in yourself and your own personal development, and for you who are curious about how other people work - and why. Have you ever had trouble understanding people around you? Are you tired of poor communication and misunderstandings? Are you looking for tools to easier get along with others? Then this is the app for you.\n\nThe biggest benefit is that from day one you will increase your social skills. You will understand people around you in a completely different way. Your various interactions with people you meet will be seen in a whole new light. The amount of unnecessary conflicts will decrease, and you will more easily understand both your partner and – why not your boss. And, not least, they will understand you.\n\nThe app costs no more than a lunch but contains insights you will benefit from for years.\nIt is based on the best-selling book Surrounded by Idiots. And builds on the worldwide model with the four colours: red, yellow, green and blue. The fundamentals can be traced all the way back to Carl Jung."

      "label": "FlitsMonster biedt ouders een geweldig handvat om hun kind te ondersteunen met het leren lezen. Door te flitsen, automatiseert je kind veel voorkomende woorden. Daardoor kan het zich meer gaan richten op nieuwe woorden en gaat het uiteindelijk sneller en beter lezen. Jonge kinderen automatiseren heel snel. \n\nDeze aanpak is zeer effectief bij minder sterke lezers en dyslectische kinderen. Dankzij de 'hulplijn' wordt het woord opgeknipt in herkenbare stukken. \nKinderen die lezen lastig vinden, lopen niet alleen bij lees- en spellingsvakken in de knoop, maar hebben ook moeite opdrachten en rekensommen goed te begrijpen. \n\nFlitsMonster vraagt actie van ouder en kind. Door 5 keer per week 5 x 1 minuut te flitsen zal je na enkele weken merkbare vooruitgang boeken. Na enkele maanden kan je leesachterstanden goed inlopen. Doordat het weinig tijd kost en een heel duidelijk vast patroon is, is het voor beiden goed vol te houden. De app is geen spelletje, maar wel speels ingericht. \n\nWat kan je met FlitsMonster:\n- woorden flitsen. Er zitten goed doordachte woordenlijsten in de app, zodat je meteen kunt beginnen.\n- Als je kind woorden al goed weet, worden woorden automatisch uitgezet. Dat houdt de lijst uitdagend.\n- Als je kind woorden lastig blijft vinden, worden woorden gemarkeerd. Ze verschijnen dan de volgende keer aan het begin. Zo krijg je ze zelf onder de knie.\n- Je kunt zelf woorden markeren, uitzetten, aanvullen om zo je kind te helpen met woorden die het lastig vindt. \n- Je kunt zelf woordenlijsten aanmaken die aansluiten bij de belevingswereld van je kind. Dierennamen? Drankjes? personages uit boeken? Alles kan en helpt!\n\nFlitsMonster bevat duizenden woorden, en dat worden er steeds meer. Zo leest je kind veel meer woorden dan op school. \n\nDe app is het meest geschikt voor kinderen van groep 3 tot en met 6."

      "label": "Every Italian verb has 89 forms that a student of Italian has to learn.  Verbi is the tool to do just that.\n\nYou can use Verbi in different ways:\n\n- Learn the patterns of verb tenses by choosing a tense and then drilling yourself on verbs in that tense. Verbi will select a random verb conjugations and present it to you to drill, then show you the correct verb form - you then repeat the quiz/answer process as many times as you want. In this way, you learn not just specific forms for verbs, but the pattern of verb forms in tenses, so you can apply that pattern to any verb.\n\n- Learn specific verbs. You can select one verb or create a verb list of verbs and have Verbi present you with drills on the verb you selected or verbs from your verbs list. You can create as many verb lists as you need, and have as many verbs on any list as you need.\n\n- You can narrow down your learning by selecting only certain tenses, only certain verb types ('-are' verbs and/or '-ere' verbs and/or '-ire' verbs), certain types (Regular verbs and/or Irregular verbs and/or Reflexive verbs) and certain Person/Numbers ('io' verb forms and/or 'tu' verb forms, etc.). These can be combined in any way to suit your learning needs; for example, you could drill yourself on verbs with an infinitive ending in \"are\", in the presente tense, only regular forms, and only in the 1st person singular person/number (\"io\").\n\nVerbi has over 500 verbs fully conjugated. These include all the verbs in Barron's 501 Italian Verbs. \n\n- Test yourself. See your improvement! Verbi has three types of tests: timed, number of verbs, and a combination of both. you can selected how long you want the test or how many verbs you want the test to quiz you on. When the test is done, you'll see your score. You can save the test results, and see a history of all saved tests - clear proof that you're learning!\n\n- Create and save any number of verb lists. This allows you to study a small set of verbs as a unit. When you use a verb list, only the verbs from that list will be used for quizzing.\n\n- See a verb's complete conjugation.\n\n- See a sample conjugation, in English, showing how each tense is used.\n\nVerbi includes a small Help file. If you'd like to see a more complete \"How-To\" document, go to www.verbtrainers.com and click on the User Manual link in the left column.\n\nYou can contact the developer at support@verbtrainers.com."

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

Your tree height distance is supplied by GPS or calculated by the app.  After top of the tree and base of the tree angles are obtained, tree height is calculated.\nThe app can also be used to measure indoor objects at home or work, or to calculate height of your friend. The Map button will toggle between map and satellite map. To select between GPS Distance and calculated Distance use Distance toggle button. Green colour indicates which distance  will be used in the next height calculation. Use calculated Distance indoor and for small distances, GPS for large distances. To measure the tree height : Tap Reset at the tree location. Red pin will drop. Move away about 3 times the estimated tree height. GPS Distance will change.\nTap Tree TOP button, clock sound starts and TOP angle is visible. Lift device straight up and aim home button microphone tree top. When on target, tap Tree TOP again. Sound stops, angle is recorded. Repeat with Tree BASE button this time aiming at the tree BASE. When clock sound stops, BASE angle is noted and tree height is announced.\nTree height is also displayed in red text. The app displays current latitude, longitude and horizontal accuracy.\nTap Guide button to read instructions on how to use this app.\n If you are using the app on sloping ground, switch Ground is Level to off position. The accuracy of the tree height depends on the accuracy of the GPS, and the skill of the user while recording the TOP and BASE angles. Use this app to get a quick estimate of the tree height. For more accurate measurements use other more precise methods."

De app heeft nu meer dan 600 soorten.\n\nDankzij het Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds en de Vlinderstichting heeft de Veldgids alle vlinders van Nederland met een lijst met ernstig bedreigde vlinders en sinds kort ook alle libellen van Nederland!!\n\n \nBeschrijving\n\nDe meest opvallende en algemene vogels, planten en paddenstoelen in één app. Is dit een Krul- of een Speerdistel, een Kraai of een Roek? Voortaan weet je direct wat er vliegt, rent of bloeit in de natuur of je eigen tuin\nSpots verzamelen, delen met vrienden en zelfs doorgeven aan de Vlinderstichting of de Nationale Database Flora en Fauna. Genieten van vogelgeluiden en professionele natuurfotografie van Han Bouwmeester. Als extra heeft de app nu ook een locatiekaart. Nooit meer verdwalen en makkelijk je spots terug vinden. \nDe Veldgidsapp kan de Friese en de Nederlandse namen tegelijk laten zien. Via instellingen in de app kun je de taal kiezen. Veel plezier met de prachtige namen uit Fryslân. Met dank aan provinsje Fryslân en Afúk\n\n\nTip van een Vogelkenner. \r\nLet op met afspelen van vogelgeluiden in de natuur. Vooral in het voorjaar reageren vogels hier sterk op en dat is verloren energie. Echte kenners nemen oortjes (koptelefoon) mee het veld in. Eén oor voor het luisteren naar de vogel en het andere voor de app. Geniet van de natuur!!"

Flitsen is een letter heel kort laten zien en deze meteen weten op te noemen, zonder na te hoeven denken. Met deze app kan je zelf kiezen welke letters je kind moet oefenen. Een handige app voor kinderen om de letters thuis en op school te oefenen.\n\nDe oefeningen: \n* Letters flitsen \n* Welke letter zie je? \n* Welke letter hoort bij het plaatje? \n* Welke letter hoor je?\n* Waar hoor je deze letter?\n* In welk woord lees je deze letter?\n\nLaat uw kind aan de slag gaan met deze leerzame app en uw kind zal spelenderwijs de letters automatiseren. Deze app is zowel voor kinderen die in groep 3 beginnen met letters leren, als voor kinderen in groep 2 die al interesse hebben in de letters en klanken. \n\nWanneer uw kind begint met het leren lezen in groep 3 kunt u in deze app zelf kiezen met welke letters uw kind aan de slag gaat door een lijst met letters samen te stellen. Zo kunt u thuis goed aansluiten bij de letters die uw kind op school aan het oefenen is. U ziet de letterkaarten in de klas van uw kind hangen (op de meeste scholen). Zo weet u welke letters uw kind aan het oefenen is op school.\n\nBekijk ook onze andere apps:\n* Letters leren lezen - juf Jannie\n* Leren lezen voor groep 3 - juf Jannie\n* Letters flitsen voor kinderen - Juf Jannie\n* Letters & cijfers met monsters\n* Leestrein - leer verhalen lezen\n* Letters leren schrijven\n* Taal en woordenschat boerderij\n* Taal en woordenschat – de zee\n* Taal en woordenschat 3 - seizoenen\n* Cijfers en getallen leren en tellen - Juf Jannie\n* Rekensommen automatiseren\n* Tafels oefenen – leren rekenen\n* Juf Jannie – klokkijken\n* Leer de dagen en maanden\n* Puzzels voor peuters en kleuters - Juf Jannie\n* Sudoku - een draken avontuur\n* Origami voor kinderen - leer vouwen met papier\n* Alfa Pi Pi (Oud-Grieks alfabet)\n* Touwfiguren maken (Ztringz)\n\nAl mijn apps bevatten eenmalige prijzen, dus geen abonnement.\n\nOver Juf Jannie Juf Jannie maakt educatieve apps voor kinderen die aansluiten op de lesstof van het basisonderwijs.  De oefeningen in de apps zijn dezelfde oefeningen als kinderen op school krijgen, maar nu oefenen ze spelenderwijs en krijgen ze direct te horen wat goed gaat en wat ze nog moeten oefenen.\n\nPrivacy Policy Juf Jannie ontwikkelt spellen voor kinderen en begrijpt hoe belangrijk privacy is door deze doelgroep. \nDe apps van Juf Jannie:\n* bevatten geen reclame.\n* bevatten geen in-app aankopen.\n* bevatten geen koppeling met sociaal media.\n* verzamelen of delen geen persoonlijke informatie.\n* bieden een informatiescherm voor ouders waarin alle apps van Juf Jannie te zien zijn."

      "label": "Tables Vault - the most fun way to learn tables! \n*** Top 5 popular apps in education*** \n*** 5 stars nomination Kids Apps Awards apps.weebly.com*** \n\nUsing this educational app kids can practice the math tables from 1 to 20 within a challenging game! You can choose which tables you want to practice and how many tables at the same time. As new sums fall down you quickly have to find the right answer mounted to the vault door to finally open the vault when completing all tables! \n\nDuring the development of TableVault several kids and teachers of an elementary school were involved. The kids told us which parts of the game they liked and teachers instructed us in standard school teachings. For example, the time in which a sum is supposed to be solved is defined and integrated into this app. The faster kids solve the sum the more points they get! This method ensures they will automatically try to improve their skills to get the highest score! \n\nIn this app an overview of all practices are saved for each child. This includes all the tables a child has practiced and how well he/she is performing for each table. Thus parents can easily track improvements of all their kids."

With this app you will not only train your brain by solving math problems, you will also learn special mental math tricks.\n\nFor many math problems, special tricks exist that make solving these much easier. It is important to know when to use which trick, but also how to solve a math problem if none of these special tricks can be used.\n\nThis app contains 44 lessons (with up to 3 tricks per lesson) where you will learn tips and tricks for the following types of math problems:\n-Addition\n-Subtraction\n-Multiplication\n-Division\n-Divisibility\n-Remainders\n-Squaring\n-Square and cube roots\n-Calculate the weekday for any date\n\nYou will not only learn the special tricks, but also more general solutions.\n\nIn the second part of this app, the training, you can solve random math problems with increasing difficulty (adaptive training). Or you can select what type of math problem you want to practice, and in which range the numbers should be (training with choice). The goal here is not only to become better and faster at solving math problems, you will also learn to detect which trick would be the best for the current math problem. This is why there is a help button in the training-section. If you push this button, the application will search for the trick or tip that is possibly the easiest for solving the current math problem.\n\nAdditional features:\n-Two languages: All texts are in english and german.\n-Two different GUI-designs: Use a blue background with white text in sci-fi movie style. Or switch to a white background with black text.\n\nLessons:\nIntroduction\nAddition\nSubtraction\nSingle digit multiplications\nx 10 and x 5\nx 2, x 4 and x 8\nx 9 and x 3\nx 6 and x 7\nx 11 and x 12\nMultiplication of numbers between 11 - 19 and between 91 - 99\nMultiplication of numbers close to a power of 10\nMultiplication of numbers close to multiples of 100 or 1000\nMultiplying numbers with two different bases\nMultiplication of 2 digit numbers\nMultiplication of 3 digit numbers\nx 111, x 21 and x 121\nx 101 and x 1001\nx 15, x 25 and x 50\nx 95 and x 125\nx 2-digit numbers that end in 5 and x 50 to 59\nx 99, x 999 and x 999999…\nx 19 and x 2-digit numbers that end in 9 (including a special case)\n÷ 10, ÷ 5 and ÷ 4\n÷ 9 and ÷ 8\nDivision: Remainders method\nGeneral division method\nDivisibility by 2, 5 and 10\nDivisibility by 9, 3 and 6\nDivisibility by 4, 8 and 7\nDivisibility by 11, 12 and 13\nRemainder when dividing by 2, 5 and 10\nRemainder when dividing by 3, 9 and 6\nRemainder when dividing by 4 and 8\nRemainder when dividing by 7 and 11\nSquaring 1 to 29\nSquaring numbers ending with 5, and 50 to 59\nSquaring 26 to 125\nSquaring numbers close to 1000, and general squaring method\nSquaring numbers ending with 1 or with 25\nSquaring numbers ending with 9 or that have only 9s\nPerfect cube root\nPerfect cube root of numbers between 100 and 200\nPerfect square root\nDay for any date"

It takes a lot of time and practice to master mental arithmetic. Our game is created to make this learning enjoyable and fun for children. \r\n\r\nThe game allows you to select the math facts and operations you would like to master, so each grade in the elementary school (K-5) can play it:\r\n•  Kindergarten: addition and subtraction within 10\r\n• 1st Grade: addition and subtraction within 20 (Math Common Core Standards: CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.OA.C.5)\r\n• 2nd Grade: two-digit addition and subtraction, multiplication tables (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.2.OA.B.2)\r\n• 3rd Grade: multiplication and division, addition and subtraction within 100, times tables (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.OA.C.7, CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.3.NBT.A.2);\r\n• 4th Grade: three-digit addition and subtraction\r\n\r\nYou can select yourself the math facts and operations you would like to master and also configure the type of tasks and speed of monsters.\r\n\r\nDifferent levels, monsters, weapons, additional accessories and the clothes of the character won’t allow the child to become bored. Instead, these elements will motivate him to move forward in the learning process!\r\n\r\nWe think fighting slime monsters is a more entertaining and interesting way of achieving daily arithmetic practice than flash cards or quiz apps. Kids in kindergarten all the way up to 4th grade will enjoy practicing mental math with the “Fun Mathematics” trainer!\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your feedback. In case you have any questions or comments about the game, please write to us at slimesapp@speedymind.net.\r\n\r\nTerms of service: https://speedymind.net/terms\r\nPrivacy policy: https://speedymind.net/privacy-policy"

You can travel around the world with numerous flying objects, cars and ships.\nYou can disguise yourself as a Viking, pirate or pilot. \n\nWith its numerous objects, this \"\"digital doll's house\"\" is perfect for creative role-playing.\nYour children will learn about the special features of different countries (Mexico, USA, India, France, the Caribbean and Germany) and discover differences but also numerous similarities.\nTo ensure that no child feels excluded, Fiete World contains a variety of people with different skin colours.\n\nNEW in this version: \nMEXICO\nWith horses, jeep, or pick-up truck through the jungle, walking through the city with a huge mechanical skeleton or with a hot air balloon over the cactus-covered desert. \nFeeding jungle animals, making chocolate, painting murals, making tacos or fighting with wrestlers. Mexico offers a lot of extreme variety.\n\nUSA\nChildren can ride a Ferris wheel in the colourful theme park and re-enact the moon landing or Jurassic Park in the film studio. They play with Kong the giant ape, visit the school and the record shop and when they are hungry they visit the burger shop or eat something at the hot dog stand. Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology. What is particularly exciting here are the clear contrasts between tradition and technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE APP\n- Discover a huge world\n- Switch between day and night mode\n- Go on a treasure hunt, sail the pirate ship\n- Ride an elephant, dinosaur \n- Play with a robot or with a huge skeleton\n- Fell trees and use the wood to make a fire\n- Disguise yourself\n- plant flowers and vegetables\n- Change the wheels of all cars\n- Bake a cake\n- Fly a helicopter, a jet, a historic aircraft, a hot air balloon or a U.F.O.\n- have a picnic on the beach - deliver packages\n- Send postcards around the world\n- Discover souvenirs from all over the world in Fiete's room\n\nIMPROVE CHILDREN\n- Fantasy role playing games\n- Telling your own stories\n- Experiment\n- Interaction with others\n- Understanding the world\n- Open-mindedness\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Ahoiii, a small app development studio from Cologne.

The measurement will take 20 minutes; every 20 seconds there will appear 5 options on your screen (task oriented, wandering, walking, disturbing and other). You select one; describing the student’s behaviour at that exact moment. The observation will be stopped right after the 20 minutes have passed. Next, you will get the results of your observation as a circular histogram with percentages. In case you are not able to observe a student for the full 20 minutes, you can always pause the measurement and decide to stop the observation or continue a few minutes later. Finally you will be able to send yourself the results in a well structured report by email. \nBy using this app you won’t be needing paper forms or extra time to get a clear overview of the results. The Tijdsteekproef will provide you with a clear overview of the results of all your students, completely online!"

Thank\nyou” - Chattity\n\nSound Touch is the #1 app for entertaining and engaging young children -- complete with\nanimal sounds and music.\n\nStimulate children's brains and teach them all at the same time.\n\nListen to the sounds that farm animals, pets and other wildlife make in nature by touching\nwhimsical cartoons. Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

It’s the kind of thing you can imagine a science teacher using in the classroom of the future — except that we don’t have to wait.” - CNet\n \n“Zoom from Mercury to Pluto (which makes the cut in this app), passing each planet’s moons along the way. Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation. Turn into an astronomer and explore planets, moons, satellites, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, stars and other celestial bodies.

The amount of information users can learn about the planets, moons, satellites and other celestial bodies is impressive. Information is age appropriate, detailed and animated video clips make learning our solar system even more engaging!\n\nThe entire Solar system can be explored with Solar Walk app!"

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

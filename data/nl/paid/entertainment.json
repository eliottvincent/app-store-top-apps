This deck is shuffled and delt. So each player gets eight cards.\n\nBefore a round is started, trump suit is being chosen. A trump suit can be determined in two ways:\n- At random: The computer decides trump suit. The user may play or pass;\n- User choice: By turn a user chooses the trump suit.\n\nThen a round starts. By turn the players throw a card. The first card thrown, determines the suit. The other players must follow the suit if possible. When four cards are played, the player with the highest card wins the trick. This player may start for the next trick.\n\nThe game supports two variants Amsterdam type and Rotterdam type."

It's truly immersive. \n\nHue Thunder provides an unique thunder simulation in various settings. Every time you start one of the ambiances it will be different and unpredictable. Al light effects have been precisely created and synced with thunder sound to create and impressive simulation with your Philips Hue setup. It will impress everyone.\nHue thunder can also be used to train pets to get used to thunder sounds and lightning flashes.\n\nOur unique node based soundscape engine, which is behind the beautiful designed and intuitive user interface, is truly innovative. It uses techniques which are used by top game designers and audio engineers to mimic nature's way and randomness. On top of that our soundscape apps use a unique and simple to use occurrence slider to let you decide how often a specific bird or other sound is used in the preset. Still it's totally unpredictable when a specific sound is being heard therefore producing an amazingly natural sound experience. It can run for hours on end without getting repetitive like other sound engines do. \n\nChoose from the following thunder presets and themes:\n\nThunder presets:\n- Light drizzle.\n- On a rainy day.\n- Heavy rain pours down.\n- Light thunder storm.\n- Inside the thunder storm.\n- Heavy thunder storm.\n- Tornado Alley.\n- Hurricane mayhem.\n\nThunder Ambient presets:\n- A damp rain forest.\n- At the beach after a warm day.\n- Staring out the window in a busy city.\n- A walk in the city under the umbrella.\n- Bad weather camping at the lake.\n- Storm over NYC.\n- After the storm.\n- In the car.\n- Bike ride through Amsterdam.\n\nThe following elements can be altered during playback:\n- Sky brightness.\n- Sky On/Off\n- Thunder brightness.\n- Thunder occurrence.\n- Environment volume.\n- Thunder volume.\n\nOther features:\n- Bluetooth and Airplay supported with delay compensation.\n- Sleep timer to safely fall asleep with a stormy fading background. Lights turn off after sleeptimer is finished.\n\n (Hue Thunder also works without Philips Hue, but obviously without light effects)."

      "label": "LSW Collector is the most detailed LEGO Star Wars minifigure collecting app around and is the perfect way to catalogue your collection! Use the search bar to quickly find your minifigures by unique ID, name, or set number. You can swipe between minifigure entries to easily update your collection! Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes. You can also add multiple of the same minifigure to your collection and then track your total progress on the My Collection tab.\n\nLegal Information:\n\nLEGO and the minifigure are registered trademarks of the LEGO Group.\n\nSTAR WARS is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm, Ltd.

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio.

Select a keyword / phrase you want to change from the web page, when it disappears or changes, the browser will stop refreshing and sound an Alarm!.\n\nThe Browser Features:\n-Refresh until word or phrase no longer appears on the page (this means you are no longer stuck on the holding page)\n-Auto Detect if page failed to load.\n-Prevent the iPhone or iPad going to sleep\n-Two search methods \n-Refresh until word Appears \n-Refresh until word Disappears / changes\n-Change the refresh speed.\nExample uses:\n- Sales sites: Get an advantage with sneaker sales, new exclusive phone sales and clothing sales.  Sometimes you need to keep refreshing a website just before a sale starts, choose a keyword or phrase like ‘currently unavailable’ and the app will keep refreshing until the word disappears, i.e the sale is on. This can give you the vital seconds required to purchase / cop that exclusive sales item.  \n\n- Ticketing sites: will often keep you in a queue on a web page known as a ‘holding page’, on some sites refreshing this page can get you through to the purchase page. This is where The Refreshinator helps, More refreshes = More chances of a ticket. When you are stuck on a \"holding page\", The Refreshinator can be set to automatically refresh the holding page until you get onto the purchase area. As each refresh is a chance, the speed you refresh the page counts Increases your chances. The Refreshinator can do this faster than a person and can drastically improve your chances of getting through a ticket queue. The App was used to purchase tickets in the Glastonbury ticket sale and Glastonbury Resale, it get through to the purchase area over ten times in an average of 30 seconds. Once in 3 seconds.\n\n- Chat rooms / sports sites:  Some sites do not refresh when updates occur, you can set the Refreshinator to Refresh a site until a a game finishes or a chat group updates, in these scenarios we recommend using a a refresh rate of 5 - 15 seconds as updates are not so frequent.\n\n- Job listings, some site put up job listing at a given point of time however watching and refreshing the site continuously is a chore. Just put in the key word or phrase and set the app to keep refreshing until the listing appears."

The spectator  just by looking at a slideshow and you can guess or force several images in the same performance while you have your back to the audience.    “ True mentalism”\n\n—NO INTERNET connection needed.\n—Intuitive and super easy to learn and perform.\n—Fully customizable, create your own photo album and share it with other users. \n\nImpossible right? what the spectator  doesn't know and will never suspect is that while watching a slideshow from the iphone photo gallery, Photopsia app is analyzing their face, detecting when the spectator closes or opens their eyes, ruling out blinking. \n\n\n\"Phenomenal magic app with lots of potentials, using mindblowing technology.\" - Benke Smith \n\n“Never thought that something like that is possible… PHOTOPSIA broke all the limits”  alexandru miclea ( administrator group facebook magic apps)\n\n“A wicked clever app with ingenious input methods that will blow people’s minds. \nFirst impressions.. Just amazing!! “ - Shameer Salim\n\n\nHere are some features where you can create your own routines:\n\nForced feature\nWith this feature you will be able to force one or several items (image). In the case of not adding any image as force, you will only be able to do the peek. ( guessing the last image the spectator saw by closing their eyes to focus on the details of that image)\n\nWhen the spectator closes his eyes Photopsia app recognizes the image that is displayed just at the moment of closing his eyes.\n\nWhen the Spectator opens his eyes, the image selected in the settings will be shown as forced, this can be repeated with one or more images from the same album and even without leaving the performance, choose another album to perform the same or another effect.\n\nMatch force feature\n\nIt is often used as a match between two spectator\n\nFirst spectator select freely an item (when eyes close) to automatically become the force item when the second spectator ( parnet) open the eye.\n\nDual Force\n It allows you to force an item depending on the item chosen freely by one spectator\n\nEach image (item) is paired with another, depending on the one the spectator chooses freely when closing his eyes, when the spectator opens them ,the first image he will see will be the forced image that is paired with the chosen one freely when he closes his eye before"

To request cameras from a specific area, please send us an e-mail or let us know in the discussion forum as opposed to requesting it in a 1-star review. Thanks! :) \n\nVisit https://skjm.com/ispy/vid.php to view the iSpy Demo & Features video! \n\n- Swipe back and forth between pages of camera thumbnails that are updating in real-time. \n- Tap a thumbnail to zoom in. Tap the X to zoom out. \n- If the camera supports it, tap the Control button to control it. (You may have to wait in line for your turn.) \n- Swipe to move the camera, pinch to zoom in and out. (Zoom may not be supported by some cameras.) \n- Choose from a number of camera presets, if available. \n- Save cameras as your favorites. \n- Save or share camera snapshots.\n- Rate cameras. \n\nChoose from the following camera list tabs: \n\n- Random - Displays a random selection of cameras. \n- Top Rated - Displays the cameras sorted by average rating. \n- Most Recent - Displays the cameras sorted by the date and time they were added. \n- Favorites - Displays your favorite cameras. \n\nYou can also search through the database of cameras by Category, Country, State, City, or Keywords. \n\nIf you are looking to connect to your own private webcams and network cameras (and receive notifications on your iOS device when motion is detected) then check out our other applications, iCam Pro and iCam - https://skjm.com/icam/"

      "label": "Do you enjoy watching videos on your iPhone? Do you hate not being able to because your iPhone cannot support the video format? Or do you hate the inconvenient and time-consuming hassle of trying to convert video formats to fit into one that your iPhone can support? \nThis is why the AVPlayer was created. The AVPlayer can play almost any computer video file format such as AVI, Xvid, WMV and much more clearly and effortlessly. No converting hassles. Just copy files via USB and just drag and drop into the AVPlayer’s Media Explorer. \nThe AVPlayer can also support external subtitle files such as SMI and SRT. So if you enjoy watching videos on your iPad, then the AVPlayer is an absolute necessity. \n\n• Support Formats\n- Dolby Digital (AC3), Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3)\n- Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- MP4,MOV,M4V\n- XVID,AVI,WMV,RMVB,ASF,H264,MKV… most of all movie file formats. \n- SMI, SRT, TXT, SubStationAlpha Subtitles \n\n• Post Processing \n- High quality video processing \n- Contrast,Saturation,Brightness \n- TV-Out \n\n• Control the playback speed (From 0.5X to 2.0X) \n- User setting support \n- Sweep to the left : move to backword 10 sec \n- Sweep to the right : move to forward 10 sec \n- Sweep to the top : 1.5X speed \n- Sweep to the down : normal speed \n\n• Additional features \n- Rotation Lock / Aspect ratio:auto/16:9/4:3/Full screen \n- Folder Management:Pass code/Move/Rename/Create \n- Resume play from last position \n- Scrubbing search \n- supports e-mail attachment by \"Open In\" feature \n\n• USB/WIFI Transfer \n\n• Note \n1. How to add video with USB \n- Run iTunes 9.1 or above \n- Device->My Device(My iPad)->Apps, drag and drop files to the AVplayer's documents \n\n2. Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal."

It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

No banners, no ads, no getting spam'd; just pure fart fun. It was even used on Conan O'Brien's show on TBS to create one of their segments.\n\nThese 27 farts will make you laugh, cry, and hopefully embarrass a few people. \n\nDon’t accept any substitutes. This is a great tool; with everything from the interface to the sounds being made for the true fart prankster. \n\nEach sound was meticulously remastered to cut out any background noises and made to be crystal clear. Other apps will throw in a few sounds littered with ugly background noises that aren’t true to the clarity of a real fart.\n\nThere is a “Help” page with easy to read instructions, as well as an email address for technical support and feedback. We promptly answer support requests and listen to any recommendations to help make this app even better!"

It was the first comic reader in the App Store, it’s still the best. \n\n• Organize your collection how YOU want. Put series inside series, use dividers to manage long lists.\n• Automatically sorts comics into their series.\n• Super fast reading view with two-page mode and assisted panning.\n• Page position lock so you don’t see the same borders page after page.\n• Does the right thing when you rotate your device, many comics have a mixture of portrait and landscape pages.\n• Lightning fast search, by comic title and tags.\n• Parental lock for individual series.\n\nIN APP PURCHASES\n\nFor a very reasonable price you can also unlock\n•  Comic Finders, create smart series that show you unread comics from all over your library.\n•  Seven new, gorgeous themes.\n\nCOMIC IMPORT \n\n• WI-Fi using a web browser on a PC or Mac.\n• Drop Box, iCloud Drive, etc using iOS document sharing.\n• AirDrop from a Mac.\n• iTunes via USB or Wi-FI\n\nTHE SLIDER\n\nComic Zeal features the innovative slider, it's a pointer, a container and a toolbox, all in one.  You can push stuff into it, then go anywhere in your collection and drag it out.  It's an incredibly fast way to organize your comics.\n\nWith the slider you can:\n\n• Reorder comics, put them into the slider in the order you want them, then drag them out.\n• Create reading lists (by making copies of comics that don't take up any space on your device)\n• Create series and dividers right in the app.  Dividers are lists that can hold comics, series and even other dividers.\n\nTIPS\n\n• Tap the ‘i’ info icon for comics, series and dividers. You can rename entries, sort a series or mark items as read or unread.\n• When zooming, hold the gesture for half a second.  Comic Zeal will lock that zoom and position when you turn the page, it's a great way to hide borders.  \n\nComics used in the screenshots:\n'Escape from Planet Nowhere',  © 2010 Otis Frampton, http://planet-nowhere.com/\n\nPlease note, there is a problem with Google Drive’s iOS extension that doesn’t allow you to open comic and other files that they consider to be ’non-standard’.  You can read more about it here: https://goo.gl/EKVRbN and here https://goo.gl/XXYRQI . You can open Comics from the Google Drive app itself using the 'Open in ...' option, just not directly from Comic Zeal."

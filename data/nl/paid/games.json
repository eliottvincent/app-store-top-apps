      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning, and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy.\n\nThe journey begins when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn’t feel right and he plans his escape.\n\n“El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Using the shadows to his advantage is the core element of the game, as “El Hijo” will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that “El Hijo” must traverse to reach his ultimate goal.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Survive the Wild West with the cleverness of a young hero\n- Explore dark monasteries, deserts, and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world\n- Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless\n- Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles\n- Use a playful arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperados\n- Inspire other children towards the path to freedom\n- Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother\n\n\n© www.handy-games.com GmbH"

Snap parts together to build your airplane's body. Place engines to add thrust. Design and attach wings and then strap yourself into the cockpit and see how it flies. \n\nDOWNLOAD AIRPLANES\nOver 250,000 airplanes are available to download for free from SimplePlanes.com. Find anything from old WW2 bombers to next-generation fighters to sci-fi spacecraft. You can upload your own airplanes and rise through the ranks from a bronze builder to a gold level builder.\n\nDYNAMIC FLIGHT MODEL\nFlight simulation at its finest. Every little change you make in the designer impacts how the airplane flies. Weight distribution, thrust, lift, and drag are all calculated continuously while flying. Parts can break off in spectacular fashion while flying due to over-stress or by hitting something. The fun won't stop there though. You can keep on flying even with a missing wing if you've got the skills.\n\nSANDBOX MODE\nUse all available parts to build airplanes with no restrictions. The sky is the limit. Literally.\n\nCHALLENGES\nClimb into the cockpit of one of your custom aircraft and see how it does in the challenges. Land on aircraft carriers, dodge surface-to-air missiles, race through courses, and so much more.\n\nEDUCATIONAL\nTutorials will help players learn the basics of real airplane design and the considerations that need to be taken when airplanes are made."

Play with friends or strangers in online play, challenge the AI, or play offline with friends face-to-face! \r\n\r\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t​he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens. \r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\r\n\r\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\r\n\r\n- Featuring original art by The Oatmeal\r\n\r\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\r\n \r\n- Digital versions of the hit expansions, including Streaking and Barking Kittens, as well as digital exclusive Betrayal and Party decks\r\n\r\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\r\n\r\nCreat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\r\n\r\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money. You must be at least 13 years old to download and play. There is also an option to compete online against strangers and resulting data transfer charges may apply.

It is also very hard, and I love it for that.” ***\n84/100 – PC Gamer\n \n***”It evokes lot of the more demanding thrills that modern games have left behind, the grit and the hard won satisfaction of overcoming intimidating challenges, or the experimental fun of spending hours tinkering with all the different ways you can play through a big, open-ended level. I had a blast inching my way through pretty much all of the harder stages in this game and I also think you might have a blast with it too.” ***\nSuper Bunnyhop\n \n“It’s a thing of beauty and manages to capture the planning and satisfying execution of more complex strategy games, as well as the gung-ho and the popping-off of growly man in military shooters. (...) It’s probably the best man-shootery game I’ve played in years.”\nIndie Statik\n \nDoor Kickers mixes old school, no-quarter action with modern ergonomic interfaces and puts you in command of a SWAT team during a tactical intervention.\n \nAnalyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.\n \nIt may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps and losing no people, that’s a skill harder to master.\nQuick Points:\n§ 80 single missions, 6 campaigns and unlimited gameplay via mission generator\n§ Over 65 weapons and gear items to use and overcome the enemy.\n§ Top Down perspective  for optimal tactical analysis\n§ Real Time With Free Pause\n§ No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces\n§ Realistic but action packed\n§ Non-linear levels, freeform gameplay\n\nWebsite https://inthekillhouse.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/KillHouseGames\nTwitter - @inthekillhouse"

Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.\n\nYou have only a flashlight to protect yourself.

      "label": "The ESP trainer was developed under a NASA program by Russell Targ at Stanford Research Institute.\r\n\r\nWe have found that people are able to improve their ESP scores by using a machine just like this and get in touch with the part of themselves that is psychic. This is often called a clairvoyant ability, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways.\r\n\r\nThe player is presented with four colored squares.  For each trial, one has been selected at random by the ESP Trainer.  Your task is to choose the correct square.  \r\n\r\nIf you succeed, you will hear a chime, feel a vibration, and see a large color picture. Otherwise, the system lights up the correct square, and you proceed with the next trial.  The score indicator at the top counts the number of correct choices.  Words of encouragement appear as you achieve the scoring levels of 6, 8. 10, 12 or 14 hits.  After 24 trials you may begin a new game.\r\n\r\nThe game offers multi-sensory feedback, reinforcement, and an opportunity to Pass, meeting all the requirements needed for learning this skill. ESP Trainer improves your ability to recognize your intuitive impressions, and it can bring you to a level of intuitive awareness beyond anything you've experienced before.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the trainer is to allow you to become aware of what it feels like when you psychically choose the correct square.  When you don't have that special feeling, we encourage you to press the Pass button.  (So this is not a \"forced choice\" test.)\r\n\r\nIn a year long NASA program with 145 subjects (under Contract 953653 NAS7-100) many were able to significantly improve their scores. Four of the subjects improved their scores at the hundred-to-one level or better. This approach has been used with surprising success on Wall Street. But of course, past results are no guarantee of future performance.\r\n\r\nBecause you are learning a new skill, slower is better than faster. \r\nIf you find yourself frequently scoring 12 or more, write to the developer at his web site www.espresearch.com.  \r\n\r\nThis game can provide the first steps toward experiencing and developing the psychic abilities hidden within us all.\r\n\r\nsoftware by Levity Novelty LLC"

      "label": "New version of the multi-awarded board game. Now in 3D. Includes improved AI, 3D landscape, new exclusive features.\n\n*** Carcassonne fits that opening game niche that every game group needs. -Tyler Nichols, Board Game Quest\n*** Carcassonne = Great game, great mechanics, great pieces, great fun! -The Board Game Family\n\nA TILE PLACEMENT GAME OF CREATING LANDSCAPES, CLAIMING AREAS, AND GAINING POINTS\nDiscover or re-discover Carcassonne, the multi-awarded tile-based game in which players draw and place their tiles to build a medieval city. Place your cities, roads, abbeys or fields to enlarge your landscape, then place your followers, the meeples. Knights, robbers or farmers... Each meeple will help you control your territory and win points.\nBut be careful, you will need all your best strategy and tactics to maximum your points! Place your tiles and your meeples wisely to stop your opponents and win the game.\n\n6 EXPANSIONS: ENLARGE YOUR LANDSCAPE AND OPTIMIZE YOUR POINTS\nThanks to the mini expansions \"\"The River\"\" and \"\"The Abbot\"\", you can embellish your landscape and vary your game to enjoy new ways to play! Double or even triple your points thanks to the new buildings in the Inns & Cathedrals expansion! And with the Traders & Builders expansion, score more points with the trading commodities and build faster with the builders! Discover the city of Carcassonne covered with a blanket of white snow in the Winter Edition... and look out for the Gingerbread Man and the bonus points he'll give you! Beware of the Dragon in \"\"the Princess and the Dragon\"\" expansion! He could eat your Meeples if you're not cautious. And be kind with the Princess: she might prefer you to other Meeples and toss them out of the cities!\n\nFEATURES\n• Accessible and tactical gameplay adapted from the award-winning Carcassonne board game    \n• 6 expansions:\n- The River, the Inns & Cathedrals, the Traders & Builders, the Winter Edition and Princess & Dragon are all available to purchase from the Game Shop.\n- Unlock The Abbot for free using your Asmodee account.\n• Up to 6 players! Play against the computer in solo mode, face off your friends in Pass and Play or challenge players from around the world in online mode\n• There is no more 3 but 4 different behaviors you can chose before starting a game with AIs. They all propose a better challenge than the previous ones. Players who want to experiment a true challenge will play against the Conqueror AI who is the strongest AI of the game.\n• Try out the aerial top view to refine your strategy!\n• Additional strategic layers compared to the physical version:\n- field view which allows you to see the field possession of each player\n- remaining tile list: allows you to see the tiles which are remaining in the draw pile\n\nLanguages available: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish\n\nYou can follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and You Tube!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/asmodeedigital/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/asmodeedigital\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/asmodeedigital/\nYou Tube: https://www.youtube.com/asmodeedigital"

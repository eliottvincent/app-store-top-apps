Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these settings.

If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\r\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\r\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\r\n\r\nWe will update and improve Real Drift constantly. Please rate and give your feedback for further improvement of the game.\r\nFOLLOW US\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Real-Drift/788082697884714"

Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages.

You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

For spring, summer, autumn and winter, there is a suitable playing field in this game, each with different rules. \n\nThe game is very simple. 2 dice are thrown. The numbers on the dice determine the size of the fields to be marked. Now select a forest symbol to be included in the scoring and the next move is made. Thanks to the cleverly designed game plans and the matching scoring rules, this simple principle always results in new exciting decisions. Most of the time, you have the choice between safe points and a riskier variant, which allows you to score significantly more points, but only if there are still suitable rolls afterwards.  Here you have to decide wisely!\n\nDue to the 4 game plans, 4 different challenges await you in one app. Because even though the very simple basic principle is the same in all 4 game plans, the different ways of awarding points always ensure an individual gaming experience.\n\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Tactical roll & write game\n- 4 seasons for varied game fun\n- 3 different modes in the app with varying degrees of randomness\n- Compete with players from all over the world in weekly highscore lists\n- Collect Achievements"

      "label": "* Toepen, de beste en enige Toepen-App in de AppStore!*\n*#Nr.1 geweest in de App Store! +50.000 downloads!*\n\n*HOE WERKT GAMECENTER?*\nKijk helemaal onderaan deze beschrijving voor een uitleg!\n\nHet klassieke kaartspel beroemd in heel Nederland is nu eindelijk op de iPad! De eerste en dus de enige Toepen-App in de App Store! Inclusief MultiPlayer!\n\n*Multiplayer*\nMet deze nieuwe 3.0 versie kan je nu overal waar je ook bent tegen je vrienden spelen! Of je nou op Wifi op 3G zit, dat maakt niet uit! Geen vrienden die ook deze App hebben? Geen probleem, je kan gewoon online spelen tegen willekeurige spelers! Wil je met z'n 4-en spelen tegen elkaar? Geen probleem! Start een multiplayer spel en nodig elkaar uit zodat je met z'n 4-en kan toepen tegen elkaar, waar je ook bent! Je kan zelfs met z'n 2-en of 3-en spelen tegen elkaar, automatisch worden de nodige virtuele tegenstanders toegevoegd!\n\n*Intelligente tegenstanders*\nIn de Single Player modus speel je tegen 3 virtuele spelers die slimmer zijn dan je denkt! Ze denken vooruit, berekenen hun kansen en toepen zelfs ook nog als ze denken dat ze kunnen winnen!\nHiernaast proberen ze jou ook te analyseren, dus als je teveel toept gaan ze vanzelf denken dat je bluft en gaan ze sneller mee!\n\n*Verschillende regels instellen*\nToepen is een fantastisch spel bekend in heel Nederland, maar de regels zijn nooit officieel vastgelegd. Dit zorgt ervoor dat bijna iedereen verschillende regels hanteert. Je kan in deze App daarom een aantal instellingen veranderen.\nBijvoorbeeld vuile/witte was, bij hoeveel punten je af bent en ook uiteraard de snelheid van het spel.\n\n*Feedback*\nUiteraard horen wij graag hoe wij de App beter kunnen maken voor jullie. Bijvoorbeeld grafische/technische verbeteringen maar misschien ook wel aparte regels die jullie hanteren als je zelf toept met je vrienden.\nMail ons op info@graafict.nl en we nemen het mee in de updates!\n\nNB: Multiplayer werkt via GameCenter. GameCenter is ingevoerd vanaf iOS 4.1, dus dat is het besturingssysteem dat je minstens moet hebben! Hiernaast werkt GameCenter niet op alle toestellen, bijv. werkt het niet op de iPhone3G!\n\n***HOE WERKT GAMECENTER?***\nEr zijn 2 mogelijke opties.\n1. Speel tegen je vrienden en 2. Speel tegen willekeurige spelers. Deze beide mogelijkheden worden nu uitgelegd.\n\n*1. Speel tegen je vrienden\nHier volgt een korte uitleg hoe je tegen je vrienden speelt op GameCenter.\n1. Open eerst de GameCenter app en log in met je standaard AppleID.\n2. Tap op vrienden en voeg eerst je vriend(en) toe waar tegen je wilt spelen.\n3. Open de Toepen App en tap op multiplayer. Dit geldt voor alle spelers die meedoen!\n4. Een van de spelers nodigt de andere spelers uit via de 'nodig uit' knop. Onderaan kan je naar wens spelers toevoegen (maximaal 4, minimaal 2) en verwijderen.\n5. De spelers krijgen de uitnodiging vervolgens te zien. In iOS5 via een strook bovenin, in iOS4 als grote alert. Tap hier vervolgens op en de verbinding tussen de spelers wordt gelegd. De speler die de rest had uitgenodigd kan nu op 'Speel nu' drukken bovenin. Veel plezier!\n\n*2. Speel tegen willekeurige personen\n1. Open de Toepen-App en tap op Multiplayer\n2. Voeg of verwijder naar wens spelers toe onderin.\n3. Druk op 'Speel nu'. GameCenter zoekt nu naar mensen die precies hetzelfde hebben gedaan, dus mensen die ook op zoek zijn naar willekeurige spelers. Hoe meer mensen aan het zoeken zijn hoe groter de kans dat je sneller een spel vindt!"

      "label": "Learn to fly radio controlled gliders and powered planes in this highly realistic flight simulator. You can use it to practise aerobatics, have a lazy fly on a rainy day, or compete to fly as fast as possible in a number of races.\n\nIt includes 28 gliders (including some electric), 15 powered planes (including three control-line), a hang glider, and a quadcopter. The simulation includes realistic models of wind flow, turbulence and thermals. You can fly with AI/computer controlled planes too, keeping you company in the air.\n\nThe sceneries include a variety of slope and flat field sites. Some are panoramic, with high graphical quality, but a fixed viewpoint. Others are 3D scenes where you can fly in or behind the plane.\n\nIt is highly configurable, so you can create and explore new terrains from inside the app, as well as adjust settings such as the wind modelling, aeroplane settings (including size and ballast) etc.\n\nIf you've never flown a radio-controlled plane before, you'll probably find it hard to fly at first. Check the support website for a video and hints on how to fly. PicaSim flight simulator won't teach you how to fly, but it can help you learn - persevere and the sky is the limit!\n\nThe planes included are:\n\nGliders/sailplanes: ASW15, Banana, Canard, Discus, Trainer, Neoslope, Genie, Icarus (DLG), Jart, Kato, Le Fish (standard & ultralight), Magpie, Martin Wing, Mini-DLG, Minimoa, Notos (DLG), Phase 6, Plank (wing), PSS Spitfire, Quartz, Sherpa II, Spirit 2.6, Tigger (F3F), Trapeze, Dreamflight Weasel.\n\nElectric gliders: Neoslope, trainer.\n\nPowered R/C planes: AcroBat, Extra (3D, normal and large size), F18, GeeBee R2, RT Eraser Five, Sopwith Pup, Spitfire, High-wing trainer, twin-propeller delta, Electric Kato, Yak 54.\n\nControl-line: Extra, Max Bee, Peacemaker.\n\nOther: Wasp (quadcopter), Moyes XS 142 (hang glider).\n\nYou can read a detailed review of PicaSim in the February 2013 edition of Radio Controlled Soaring Digest at www.rcsoaringdigest.com - \"PicaSim is a fantastic flight simulator ... after a short time it’s like having a real transmitter in your hands\".\n\nThe support website provides some information on how to add your own planes and sceneries to the simulator - and has a link to a forum if you have any questions/suggestions etc."

Play the role of a monarch atop their steed and recruit loyal subjects, build your kingdom and protect it from the greedy creatures looking to steal your coins and crown. \r\n\r\nIn the brand-new campaign mode, monarchs must now work to build a kingdom that stands over time until finding a way to defeat the Greed for good. Explore the environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep. \r\n\r\nBut you don’t have to rule alone! Introducing cooperative play to Kingdom Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together locally in classic split screen while sitting next to your fellow monarch, or even across from them on opposite sides of the device in the custom mobile feature of tabletop coop.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also includes: \r\n\r\n• Dead Lands: Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from Bloodstained the mythic demon horse “Gamigin” with its powerful charge attack. Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!\r\n\r\n• Shogun: Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to keep the feeling of exploration, discovery, and strategy alive in Kingdom Two Crowns in post-release updates with more themed settings, each with unique styles that marvel the eye while changing how you rule the lands.\r\n\r\nA challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall reign stronger than one!"

      "label": "Bake and decorate delicious cupcakes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Cupcakeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\n\nYou'll need to multitask between four areas of the cupcake shop, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to take orders from your wacky customers in the lobby.  Switch to the Batter Station to prep the pans with liners and add just the right amount of batter.  Move to the Bake Station to put the cupcakes into the oven and wait for them to bake.  Jump to the Build Station to add frosting to the cupcakes, and decorate them with a variety of shakers, drizzles, and festive toppers.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the cupcake-crafting process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Cupcakeria!  A set of well-crafted cupcakes will also earn you tips to spend on in the Shop, and Mini-Game Tickets to use in the daily Mini-Game!\n\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S CUPCAKERIA TO GO**\n\nNOW WITH HOLIDAYS - Holidays are finally available in a \"To Go\" version!

You can earn prizes in each Mini-Game, which you can use to decorate your lobby.  Earn all bronze, silver, and gold stars in a Mini-Game to unlock Rare Prizes!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added lots of new ingredients which can't be found in the original version of the game, including brand-new items for the new holidays in the game.  We've also added new holiday batters to the game, so each holiday's cupcakes will be even more unique!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading. \n\nBATTER and BAKE STATIONS - We've redesigned the Batter and Bake Stations for smaller screens, so you can easily add liners, pour batter, and bake cupcakes like a cupcake master!\n\nFROSTING CUPCAKES - You'll add frosting to cupcakes in a brand-new way that feels great with touch screens!  Choose a frosting type, then drag the cupcake left and right as the frosting pours down from above.  This new method gives you a great amount of control, letting you decorate your cupcakes like a pro!\n\nADDING TOPPINGS - The Topping Bin carousel from previous \"To Go\" games is back, making it easy to browse through your available toppings!  You'll swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the cupcake to start pouring toppings evenly across the cupcake.  Tap a button to switch to festive toppers for your cupcakes, and tap a convenient slider to swap between the two cupcakes in the order!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\n- Hands-on cupcake shop in the Papa Louie universe\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\n- Multi-task between batters, baking, frosting, and topping\n- 12 separate holidays to unlock, each with their own ingredients\n- Buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\n- Play 7 different Mini-Games using your earned tickets to win prizes\n- Decorate your shop in the Lobby Editor\n- 97 customers to unlock with unique orders\n- 85 in-game achievements\n\n** NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Cupcakeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens."

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

      "label": "In 911 OPERATOR, you take on the role of an emergency dispatcher, who has to rapidly deal with the incoming reports. Your task is not just to pick up the calls, but also to react appropriately to the situation – sometimes giving first aid instructions is enough, at other times a police, fire department or paramedics’ intervention is a necessity. Keep in mind, that the person on the other side of the line might turn out to be a dying daughter’s father, an unpredictable terrorist, or just a prankster. Can you handle all of this?\n\nPLAY ON ANY CITY IN THE WORLD*\n\nCheck out thousands of cities from all around the world. The Free Play mode lets you choose a city to play on - the game will download its map, along with real streets, addresses and the emergency infrastructure. You can also try the Career mode, which contains 6 cities with unique events – survive an earthquake in San Francisco and save Washington, D.C. from bomb attacks.\n\nMANAGE TEAMS\n\nA number of police, fire department and paramedic units are at your disposal. The forces may use a variety of vehicles (from common ambulances to police helicopters), essential equipment (e.g., bulletproof vests, first aid kits and technical tools) and consist of team members with different abilities.\n\nPEOPLE’S LIVES ARE IN YOUR HANDS!\n\nMain features:\n\n- Over 50 recorded dialogues inspired by real calls: serious and dramatic, but sometimes also funny or annoying.\n- Real First Aid instructions.\n- Opportunity to play on any city in the world!\n- 6 selected cities in Career mode, featuring unique calls and events.\n- More than 140 types of reports to encounter.\n- 12 types of emergency vehicles (including helicopters, police cars and motorcycles).\n\n***\n(!) The game requires Internet connection to download free maps. The offline game is available after downloading the maps.\n(!) The game does check the user's location once to propose a city for download. User's location is anonymous and not stored. \n\nAll map data © OpenStreetMap authors\n\n* The term “city” is used within the meaning of OpenStreetMap service and relates to urban areas described as “city” or “town” therein."

AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916/\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/\n\nBest of 2021\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1591083005/\n\nBest of 2022\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1654240446"

I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be. Say hello@buddhify.com"

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

      "label": "RESPIROGUIDE PRO: THE NEWEST VERSION, MORE PERSONAL \n\n“Simple and amazingly effective for better concentration, stress anxiety, ADHD and trauma healing” –  Kees L. Blase, medical physicist,  National Centre for Stress Management,The Netherlands.\n\nRespiroguide PRO is brought to you by Vital-EQ the International Institute for Stress Management.\n**********\nTHE ABC of STRESSMANAGEMENT\nRespiroguide uses the most recent research in neurosciences and stress management, research that has been condensed into the most convenient one-touch tool. The knowledge is based on the heart's resonant frequency  which induces heart and breath coherence.\nRespiroguide Pro will train the reflexes and so the elasticity of your vascular system. This will help in lowering blood pressure, is effective in coping with stress and anxiety, and enhances better concentration at school and work. \nHeart rate is a dynamic body function that varies in each moment. \nIn an Active state (sympathic activity) heart rate increases, \nin a Calm and relaxed state heart rate decreases. \nCardiac Coherence is the Balanced  state of the autonomic nervous system in which you feel safe and happy, free from fear and anxiety and overstressed reactions.\nThe body can be brought into the state of Cardiac Coherence through guided breathing. Guiding the resonance frequency (Respiroguide Pro) can be compared with guiding someone on a swing by pushing at just the right moment to optimise their swing.   \nEach individual has his or her own personal respiratory frequency (resonance frequency) in which cardiac coherence is optimal. This ideal respiratory frequency is between 0,06 Hz and 0,12 Hz. The Respiroguide Pro will help you to find your personal resonance frequency, which depends on the length and width of your blood vessels. \nYou can set the guide in four different frequencies:\n1. Average: F6: 6 breaths a minute = 0,1 Hz\n2. Average: F5: 5 breaths a minute = 0,083 Hz\n3. Slow: F4: 4 breaths a minute = 0,066 Hz\n4. Quick: F7: 7 breaths a minute = 0,118 Hz\nTo find your resonance frequency it’s important to experience all four breathing frequencies and notice:\n-which one provides the most balanced feeling\n-which one can be comfortably sustained for a period of at least 5 minutes\n-which one gives a maximum amplitude in Heart Rate Variability. This last function requires  access to a HRV-biofeedback instrument with a Cardiac Coherence Coach.\nCardiac Coherence Coaches can be found at  www.hartfocus.nl (Netherlands) and www.heartintelligence.com/VitalEQ  (Europe, Asea). \nThe Respiroguide Pro is a medical tested safe device. More than 20 years of research showed positive effects:lowering bloodpressure, less anxiety, enhancing performance, coping with stress, effective treatment of trauma.Take care: do not  inhale too deeply, this occasionally make you dizzy. Focusing on the exhale is the most effective way. \n\nQUICK START: press the play button and just breathe in and out with the yellow dot. Breathe in as the dot goes up, breathe out as it goes down.\n\nThe default setting is a 3 minute long exercise. This is what it takes to lower your level of stress. \nYou can gradually increase the exercise lengths, but remember to exercise three times every day. Over one week of exercising you will notice the effects in your body.\n\nProbably the best investment you will ever make. If you use it!\n\nOther options:\n1. Turn the sea wave sounds on and off (the waves are synchronized to the specific 0,1Hz frequency)\n2. Choose the duration of the exercise; remember that the secret to stress   relief is practicing several times every day, so make it simple, use the Respiroguide!\n\nFor details access the following websites:\n- www.heartintelligence.com in English\n- www.nuvitaal.nu and www.hartfocus.nl in Dutch\n- www.emnergie.com in French\n************\nWe do appreciate your feedback!\n\nVital-EQ, the International Institute for Stress Management."

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

      "label": "De iGCCheckIn app helpt je in momenten, dat je verbinding nodig hebt met jezelf of een ander. Met behulp van het model voor geweldloze communicatie, wordt je stapsgewijs bewust gemaakt, van wat je hebt waargenomen, wat je voelt, wat je nodig hebt en wat je zou kunnen doen om dit te bereiken.\n\nVerbinding met jezelf is dé sleutel om effectief om te gaan met alle triggers die in het dagelijks leven op ons af komen. Daarbij maakt het niet uit of deze triggers nu een zakelijke of privé-achtergrond hebben en of je ze als plezierig of onplezierig ervaart. \n\nDus of je nu van je leidinggevende zoveel taken krijgt dat je stress ervaart, iemand zegt: “Zo ben ik nu eenmaal...”, of een mede-weggebruiker op een zodanige manier met zijn auto invoegt dat jij genoodzaakt bent te remmen; in al deze situaties is verbinding met jezelf wezenlijk om strijd en stress te transformeren in harmonie en innerlijke rust. \n\nEen Check-in is stil staan/zitten bij wat er nu in je leeft en op die manier verbinding met jezelf te creëren. De intentie van de makers van de ‘Check-in app’ is om bij te dragen aan jouw verbinding met jezelf door je te ondersteunen op momenten dat je:\n- Uit een vicieuze cirkel van terugkerende gedachten (piekeren) wilt stappen\n- Helderheid wilt hebben over waarom iets je raakt en wat je daar zelf aan kunt doen\n- Je oordelen over jezelf en anderen wilt vertalen in ruimtegevende gevoelens en behoeftes\n\nMet behulp van het Geweldloze Communicatie model of Nonviolent Communication, de kleuren van de NVC Dancefloors en afbeeldingen van het giraffentraum project, maakt de NVC Check-in app je stapsgewijs bewust van wat je waarneemt, wat je daarbij voelt, welke behoefte wel of niet is ingevuld en wat je in deze situatie zou kunnen doen. \n\nDe volgende knoppen helpen je hier bij:\n- Druk (herhaald) op W voor je Waarneming,\n- Druk (herhaald) op G voor je Gevoel,\n- Druk (herhaald) op B voor je Behoefte,\n- Druk (herhaald) op V voor een verzoek aan jezelf of een ander.\n\nBij iedere stap wordt je ondersteund door een hulpvraag en hulp lijsten met veel voorkomende waarnemingen, gevoelens, behoeften en verzoeken. Uit deze lijsten kan je kiezen door meerdere keren op de WGBV knoppen te drukken of door aan het scroll wiel te draaien. De zin die je zo stapsgewijs maakt wordt continu geupdate in het venster zodat deze altijd actueel is.\n\nIn de praktijk kan dat er bijvoorbeeld zo uitzien:\nW: Als ik merk dat mijn gedachten steeds gaan naar het sollicitatiegesprek van morgen,\nG: Voel ik me onzeker\nB: Omdat mijn behoefte aan vertrouwen op mijn capaciteiten niet is ingevuld.\nV: Wil je, iedere keer dat die gedachtes opkomen, stil staan bij de werkervaring die je de afgelopen jaren hebt opgebouwd?\n\n- Druk op Save om de zin te bewaren. Hier kan je de zin ook inzetten als (geweldloze) tweet op Twitter of verbindende status update/share message op Linkedin.\n\nDe knoppen onderaan het scherm:\n - Druk op (herhaald) GC om je intentie aan te scherpen en de zin aan jezelf of aan een ander te richten. Je kan hier ook meer informatie vinden over de achtergrond van Geweldloze Communicatie en de makers, en een mailtje sturen naar de appmaster.\n- Druk op Mail om je verbindingsverzoek (zelf gemaakte zin in GC formaat) te mailen naar jezelf of een ander. Een mailtje wordt geopend en je kan de tekst nog aanpassen en evt. kopieren naar je agenda om hem dagelijks op een bepaald tijdstip aan jezelf te sturen.\n- Druk op Log om terug te bladeren door wat je eerder nodig had en hielp.\n- Druk op Apps voor nog meer ondersteunende apps gebaseerd op geweldloze communicatie.\n- Druk op ? voor uitleg over de knoppen en om de terug te gaan naar de hulpvraag bij een WGBV knop.\n\nWij wensen je veel verbinding bij het gebruik van de app en hopen dat je je laat je inspireren door de openingszin:\n\nWelkom ga even rustig zitten \nen verbind je met jezelf\nen wat je hier brengt.\nHaal rustig adem \nen probeer wezenlijk contact te maken \nmet wat je nu voelt\nen nodig hebt"

Not anymore!\n\nIntroducing Hidgets, your health widgets for your home screen. Select up to 11 different categories to display all your health information the way you want: steps, active energy (calories burned), distance, sleep time, heart rate, resting heart rate, weight, oxygen leves, blood glucose, water and mindful minutes. Select style, mode, source and color, and even what the widgets should open when tapping on them. \n\nYou can choose up to 11 different layout styles, from small to medium sized widgets, making the combination you want for your home screen.\n\nThis app uses HeathKit to obtain information about your movement, weight, oxygen levels, blood glucose, sleep and heart beat values, should you consent the app to do so upon launch. \n\nNote: the update frequency of the widgets depend on the iOS itself, not controllable by the app. The operating system will decide how often the widgets need to refresh, but you can force refresh them by entering the Hidgets app once and go back to the home screen.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me at schmitzoide@gmail.com or visit the website https://hidgets.com.\n\nThank you so much for your support! \n\nWith love from Portugal,\nMarcel"

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

Plus no other brainwave system makes immediately visible when your brainwaves lock in on the critical golden ratio / conjugate (implosive/ bliss) cascade - vs octave harmonics. These concepts are breakthru empowering discoveries into the very (charge implosive) NATURE of human bliss / peak perception ( Dan Winter-  www.fractalfield.com/conjugateperception ). \nUsing the same - ORIGIN OF BIOLOGIC NEGENTROPY frequency equation from Winter  ( www.fractalfield.com/physics ) -which generalize to bring ALL wave systems out of chaos- we apply that to brain wave frequency biofeedback rewards. These allow you HEAR when your critical alpha resonance is stable- and learn to generate alpha / beta/ delta cascades- so essential to bliss / trance/ peak perception / peak meditation. ALSO you can optionally measure the famous ('Tibetan') GAMMA hi frequency brainwaves.\n\nThen sync brainwaves - to multiple HRV /Heart / Pulse /Breath sensors ( chest strap or finger clip)- to allow complete brain to BREATH / HRV / coherence training. This broad spectral synchrony FULL BODY COHERENCE TRAINING - is unprecedented!  ( also in synchrony with   www.ithrve.com   HRV apps suite ).\n\nIncludes the world's most powerful BINAURAL BEAT programmable audio trigger frequencies: Accurate by equation to pure bliss / trance / negentropy - precisely tuned to the same successful plasma rejuvenation physics ( Winter and Harris)- see  www.Theraphi.net . Also with Sacral Cranial expertise from lead programmer Patrick Botte integrates precise beat note frequency options for MAYER WAVE/ HRV LF - .1hz coherence/ breath training - AND multiple options for scientific triggering of the chakras by trigger frequencies.\n\nAND - a complete system for analyzing and tuning LIFE FORCE IN SPACE: Accurate microvolt power spectra of space / rooms/ trees/ pyramids / even plants etc- up to 120 hz- enabling us to TUNE in Schumann harmonics by measurement- AND to tune out electrosmog (life 50/60 hz ). This level of detailed harmonic analysis - is also unprecedented in the literature ( starting with concepts introduced as well by Korotkov with HRV). Much more on LIFE FORCE analysis - including biologic architecture measurement / prediction of growth triggering by capacitance- all at   www.flameinmind.com  ( see LIFE FORCE options)."

Consult a dietitian and share a pdf (using email for example) of the diary, or of analyses of links between diet and symptoms\n- see the diary notes (including photos) made on your smartphone back on a tablet, and vice versa\n- give your care provider or dietitian immediate insight into your food and symptoms diary\n- gain insight into the nutritional value of your diet: the app calculates the amount energy (calories), proteins, fats, minerals, vitamins your diet provides. If desired, you can also use the app without displaying the nutritional value of your food\n\nYou can use the app if you suspect a food allergy, but also if you think that symptoms are related to food hypersensitivity. In the app's diary you note what you ate and drank, and what your symptoms are, for example stomach or bowel disorders, or skin reactions such as rashes, aggravation of itching, or pimples / acne. In the app's reports you can then see which food item(s) was/were used prior to a specific symptom."

      "label": "De tinnitus zakgids is bedoeld voor mensen die last ondervinden van oorsuizen en een manier zoeken om er mee om te gaan. Deze zakgids biedt een grondige kijk op wat tinnitus nu juist is en kan zo een ondersteuning zijn in het leren wennen aan tinnitus. Het voordeel van de digitale vorm van deze gids is dat je hem steeds op zak kan hebben (op bijv. je smartphone, tablet, ...). De informatie en methoden die in deze app worden gebruikt zijn gebaseerd op Tinnitus Retraining Therapie (TRT), een gewenningstherapie die werd ontwikkeld door Dr. Pawel Jastreboff en Dr. Jonathan Hazell. Het begrijpen en herhalen van de mechanismen achter tinnitus vormen een belangrijk onderdeel van deze aanpak. Deze gids is gemaakt om hierin een ondersteuning te zijn.\n\nVoor wie?\nDe app is bedoeld voor mensen die last ondervinden van oorsuizen en een manier zoeken om er mee om te gaan.\nDe app kan een aanvullend hulpmiddel zijn voor mensen die reeds Tinnitus Retraining Therapie (TRT) hebben gevolgd. Deze gids kan dan als kapstok dienen om de belangrijkste informatie die tijdens de sessies werd aangebracht regelmatig te herhalen.\nOok kan de app een goed vertrekpunt zijn voor mensen die nog op zoek zijn naar een manier om te leren omgaan met tinnitus. Voor deze groep kan de gids dienen als eerste basis van informatie.\nMerk op dat deze gids geen vervanging is voor therapie. Indien counseling is aangewezen, zoekt u best hulpverlening bij een gespecialiseerd tinnituscentrum.\n\nHoe gebruiken?\nDeze zakgids is bedoeld om regelmatig eens \"vast te nemen\". En dat is het grote voordeel van de digitale vorm: als app heb je de gids overal bij. Herhaal regelmatig kleine stukjes wanneer je even tijd hebt. Vele kleine beetjes helpen!\nBesef dat wennen aan tinnitus tijd vraagt: het reageren op tinnitus is een geconditioneerde reflex. Gelukkig zijn we in staat om deze reflex om te buigen, maar het is een proces met vallen en opstaan. Gun jezelf de nodige tijd en gebruik deze zakgids om het gewenningsproces te ondersteunen.\n\nWat is tinnitus?\nOorsuizen of tinnitus betekent dat je een geluid hoort zonder dat er een geluidsbron in de omgeving aanwezig is. Voorbeelden van deze geluiden zijn: fluiten, piepen, tuten, sissen, ruisen, brommen,... Heel wat mensen ervaren oorsuizen en voor sommigen heeft dit een grote invloed op het dagelijkse leven.\n\nHoe kunnen we ermee leren omgaan?\nHet is belangrijk om te beseffen dat tinnitus geen ziekte is. Toch kan tinnitus erg lastig zijn wanneer onze hersenen het geluid als iets \"bedreigends\" gaan beschouwen. Zo lang dat het geval is, gaan onze hersenen er juist op focussen in plaats van het te negeren. Dat is helemaal normaal: iets wat we beschouwen als een \"bedreiging\" gaan we meer aandacht geven.\nBij tinnitus staat de reactie echter niet in verhouding tot de prikkel. We zijn dus veel te sterk aan het reageren op een signaal dat eigenlijk heel onschuldig is. Gelukkig kunnen we deze reactie beïnvloeden en zelfs doen uitdoven. Een eerste stap daarin is altijd dat we begrijpen hoe tinnitus juist werkt en waarom we het horen. En dat is het belangrijkste doel van deze zakgids."

      "label": "Did you know that your heart beats faster during inhalation and slower during exhalation AND did you know that this is good for you?\n\nThe technical term is RSA (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) - a good arrhythmia controlled by your autonomic nervous system. \n\nHigh variability of the heart rate stands for a good autonomic balance and activity of the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and relaxation nerve).\n\nHeartBreath is a biofeedback tool, that addresses exactly this relationship between breathing and heart rate.\n\nThe app guides you through a simple slow-breathing exercise (with pictures and sounds), while detecting and displaying the intervals between your heartbeats. You can measure, train and evaluate your personal status. No additional hardware devices are needed. HeartBreath is able to detect heartbeats by positioning your finger on the lens of the phone’s camera.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\nIntegrated VaYou Sound Flows, which provide an exceptional sound experience on acoustic pacing.\n\nHigh quality and customizable control of the bio-feedback exercise with pictures (you can work with pictures from your photo library) and sounds. \n\nLive display of the current heart rate and variability values while recording.\n\nIn just a few breaths, HeartBreath is able to compute your resting heart rate.\n\nNo additional hardware is needed. The calculation works with a finger on the lens of the iPhone’s (or iPod’s) camera (for iPad only device models with flash). Optionally, an external heart rate monitor can be used. For compatible devices (Polar H10) display/recording/evaluation of true ECG data is supported. As a special extra, the app allows the comparison of data between the finger on the camera and the heart rate monitor.\n\nUnlike many other HRV apps, HeartBreath offers a precise visualization for every single heartbeat and, if necessary, tools for interactive correction of the beats. This is very important for the high reliability of HRV parameters, since single ectopic heartbeats or data artifacts can result in strange adulteration of HRV values.\n\nIntegrated tools to determine your optimal breathing speed. Various studies show that each person has an individual optimal RSA breathing rate in the range between 4 and 7 breaths per minute.\n\nTrend evaluations over longer periods of time.\n\nHeartBreath integrates with the Apple Health app.\n\nPrivacy is important to us! The app does not require registration and you have full control over the data of your sessions, which is only stored on your phone."

This pattern can help provide you with temporary relief of the ringing caused by tinnitus.\n\n1) Find your frequency by using the slider while playing a tone. Use this to match to your tinnitus frequency.\n\n2) Play the pattern and listen at a low volume. Listen for 5-10 minutes or up to a few hours.\n\n3) Repeat this process daily (or whenever you have ringing symptoms)\n\nDOES IT WORK?\n\nACRN Therapy has shown promising results when studied amongst a wide range of tinnitus patients. Some see significant relief, while others only minor. While we can't promise it will work for you, the feedback we have received has been promising.\n\nFOR BEST RESULTS\n\n* Put on headphones\n* Set the volume to a low, but audible level.\n* Listen for a few minutes (or up to a few hours) at a time.

Each note in this scale has specific healing properties and this recording uses the fourth note, which resonates to a frequency of 639 Hz. \n\nThis frequency works on connecting and harmonising relationships and deals with our perceptions of love. It can help you to change the way in which you interact with the world so that you bring more harmony and balance in your life and can help with issues around self-love and acceptance, loneliness and emotional stability.\n\nThis recording contains two tracks, the first you can use in the daytime as it will guide you back to full waking consciousness at the end. The second track will guide you into a deep sleep state at the end, which makes it ideal for using before you go to sleep at night.\n\nWhen you are instructed to repeat affirmations, connect with positive feelings (e.g. happiness, joy, love), this will help you absorb the suggestions on a deeper level. You don’t have to repeat the affirmations out loud but do make a strong connection with them.\n\nThis App includes:\n639 Hz Solfeggio Sonic Meditation Audio Track 1 – 36:11 (awake version)\n639 Hz Solfeggio Sonic Meditation Audio Track 2 – 42:11 (sleep version)\nFA 639 Hz Solfeggio Music Only Audio Track – 11:52\n\nSolfeggio Chart\nGlenn Harrold's Self-Hypnosis e-Book.\nAbout the Ancient Solfeggio Scale and Healing Sounds e-Book\nHow To Use This App e-Book\nAbout The Authors e-Book"

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

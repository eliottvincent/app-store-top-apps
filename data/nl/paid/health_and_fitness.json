AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916/\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/\n\nBest of 2021\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1591083005/\n\nBest of 2022\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1654240446"

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

Consult a dietitian and share a pdf (using email for example) of the diary, or of analyses of links between diet and symptoms\n- see the diary notes (including photos) made on your smartphone back on a tablet, and vice versa\n- give your care provider or dietitian immediate insight into your food and symptoms diary\n- gain insight into the nutritional value of your diet: the app calculates the amount energy (calories), proteins, fats, minerals, vitamins your diet provides. If desired, you can also use the app without displaying the nutritional value of your food\n\nYou can use the app if you suspect a food allergy, but also if you think that symptoms are related to food hypersensitivity. In the app's diary you note what you ate and drank, and what your symptoms are, for example stomach or bowel disorders, or skin reactions such as rashes, aggravation of itching, or pimples / acne. In the app's reports you can then see which food item(s) was/were used prior to a specific symptom."

      "label": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance.

HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

That you are done drinking! My app does not have a reset button or a way to add a drink. ;-> \n\n2.

I knew exactly what you needed to ideally time contractions!\n\nTiming a contraction is easy, press Start to start and Stop to stop. But I discovered personally how stressful it gets and that you can easily forget about pushing any buttons. That's why this App lets you hear a small beep at 60 and 90 seconds, even when you turn off the App, to make sure you don't forget!\n\nDuring labor it's very important that you call the midwife and help at the right times. That's why this App automatically calculates exactly two most important things you need to know:\n- The duration of the contraction\n- The time that has passed since the last contraction\nIt will show you a beautiful summary of these calculations so you can immediately see if you can call your midwife already. Afterwards you can even share this overview with your midwife or yourself for the records!\n\nThe birth of your child is one of the most important times in your life, so do yourself a favor!\nDownload this App, and be prepared!\n\nTerms of use\nhttps://graafict.nl/termsofuse.html"

How to stimulate your baby's mental development and help him turn his 10 predictable, great, fussy phases into magical leaps forward describes the incredible mental developmental changes (leaps) and regression periods that all babies go through. Understanding the real reason behind crying, eating and sleeping problems is the only real solution every parent needs. The Wonder Weeks reveals what’s going on inside baby’s mind.\n\nThe audio-book includes:\n•\tWeek-by-week guide to baby's behavior\n•\tWhen to expect the fussy behavior, what this implies (cranky, clingy, crying (the three C's) behavior) and how to deal with these regression periods (leaps)\n•\tA description from your baby's perspective of the world around him and how you can understand the changes he's going through\n•\tFun games and gentle activities you can do with your child\n\nThe audio book is based on the scientific- and parental-world-changing discovery of a phenomenon: all normal, healthy babies appear to be more fussy at very nearly the same ages, regression periods, and sleep less in these phases.\n\nThese age-related fluctuations in need for body contact and attention (regression periods) are related to major and quite dramatic changes in the brains of the children. These changes enable a baby to enter a whole new perceptual world and, as a consequence, to learn many new skills. This should be a reason for celebration, but as far as the baby is concerned these changes are bewildering. He's taken aback—everything has changed overnight. It is as if he has woken up on a strange planet. He needs you to guide him and understand what he is going through! Get ready to rediscover the world all over again with your baby…"

Until the focus session is over, you can’t turn off or minimize the app. If you do, the focus session will fail and your success rate stats will suffer. The app stays on for the entire duration of the session. Battery usage is minimal because screen is dimmed. Your phone and all the distractions that come with it are basically blocked.\n\nDo you have a nasty habit of checking your social networks, messenger apps, news sites, just before going to bed? Turn on the focus session one or two hours before sleep. Once the time is up your phone will silently turn off the Focus app and the screen. You can finally go to sleep without cluttering your head beforehand. No more mobile addiction induced insomnia. You can invite more mindfulness into your life.\n\nThis app provides clear statistics displaying how many of your focus sessions were successful and how many times you did not make it to the end.\n\nTreat yourself with some precious iPhone-free time; you play a game of focus against yourself.

Deficiency results in weakened bones and teeth prone to fracture (a break), weakened muscles with muscle cramps and spasms, dry skin, and brittle hair and nails. \nThis app will set your default daily calcium target as the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) provided in the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, which depends on your age and sex. You can change this target at any time.\nRecord the foods and amounts you eat using the barcode scanner, speech recognition, by favoriting foods, or using Search and using the serving sizes provided. The serving sizes are mainly those suggested by USDA Food Data Central, but can be changed at any time. Your progress towards your target daily intake will be shown on the dashboard in real-time. \nYou can also view your progress over time on the Month view dashboard, and export food diaries and calcium intake into a spreadsheet for your own information or to share with healthcare providers.\nYou can synchronize the app with all your Apple devices and other First Line Medical Communications Ltd nutrient counter apps.\nApple's HealthKit functionality is integrated in the app's user interface so you can share data with Apple's Health app.\nThe app is curated and contains 325+ common (mainly healthy) foods and drinks and you can add your own branded and other foods and recipes at any time using the barcode scanner, voice recognition or the keyboard. \nAlso useful nutritional information via the Info tab.\nThe interface is quick and intuitive to navigate, but you may find it useful to familiarise yourself with the full functionality of the app by touching the icons, words, and bars on every screen and swiping left and right on the Tracker screen."

It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

De mini-bands hebben verschillende weerstanden (van licht naar zwaar: geel, groen, blauw en zwart). De power bands hebben ook twee weerstanden: geel, de lichtere en rood de zwaardere. Begin met de lichtere variant en bouw dit geleidelijk op. Je kunt deze banden op allerlei manieren inzetten om zo je schouders, borst, armen, rug en benen sterker te maken.\nDe banden zorgen voor een constante spanning op je spieren, waarmee je heel efficiënt kracht en uithoudingsvermogen kunt trainen, ze verhogen de stofwisseling en zorgen zo voor een hogere verbranding, zelfs na de workout. Met enkele eenvoudige oefeningen kun je je kracht en flexibiliteit vergroten en je coördinatie verbeteren, maar je kunt de bands ook gebruiken om oefeningen te doen om af te vallen, of juist te herstellen van een blessure.\n\nProbeer ze eens! BandZe!"

      "label": "RESPIROGUIDE PRO: THE NEWEST VERSION, MORE PERSONAL \n\n“Simple and amazingly effective for better concentration, stress anxiety, ADHD and trauma healing” –  Kees L. Blase, medical physicist,  National Centre for Stress Management,The Netherlands.\n\nRespiroguide PRO is brought to you by Vital-EQ the International Institute for Stress Management.\n**********\nTHE ABC of STRESSMANAGEMENT\nRespiroguide uses the most recent research in neurosciences and stress management, research that has been condensed into the most convenient one-touch tool. The knowledge is based on the heart's resonant frequency  which induces heart and breath coherence.\nRespiroguide Pro will train the reflexes and so the elasticity of your vascular system. This will help in lowering blood pressure, is effective in coping with stress and anxiety, and enhances better concentration at school and work. \nHeart rate is a dynamic body function that varies in each moment. \nIn an Active state (sympathic activity) heart rate increases, \nin a Calm and relaxed state heart rate decreases. \nCardiac Coherence is the Balanced  state of the autonomic nervous system in which you feel safe and happy, free from fear and anxiety and overstressed reactions.\nThe body can be brought into the state of Cardiac Coherence through guided breathing. Guiding the resonance frequency (Respiroguide Pro) can be compared with guiding someone on a swing by pushing at just the right moment to optimise their swing.   \nEach individual has his or her own personal respiratory frequency (resonance frequency) in which cardiac coherence is optimal. This ideal respiratory frequency is between 0,06 Hz and 0,12 Hz. The Respiroguide Pro will help you to find your personal resonance frequency, which depends on the length and width of your blood vessels. \nYou can set the guide in four different frequencies:\n1. Average: F6: 6 breaths a minute = 0,1 Hz\n2. Average: F5: 5 breaths a minute = 0,083 Hz\n3. Slow: F4: 4 breaths a minute = 0,066 Hz\n4. Quick: F7: 7 breaths a minute = 0,118 Hz\nTo find your resonance frequency it’s important to experience all four breathing frequencies and notice:\n-which one provides the most balanced feeling\n-which one can be comfortably sustained for a period of at least 5 minutes\n-which one gives a maximum amplitude in Heart Rate Variability. This last function requires  access to a HRV-biofeedback instrument with a Cardiac Coherence Coach.\nCardiac Coherence Coaches can be found at  www.hartfocus.nl (Netherlands) and www.heartintelligence.com/VitalEQ  (Europe, Asea). \nThe Respiroguide Pro is a medical tested safe device. More than 20 years of research showed positive effects:lowering bloodpressure, less anxiety, enhancing performance, coping with stress, effective treatment of trauma.Take care: do not  inhale too deeply, this occasionally make you dizzy. Focusing on the exhale is the most effective way. \n\nQUICK START: press the play button and just breathe in and out with the yellow dot. Breathe in as the dot goes up, breathe out as it goes down.\n\nThe default setting is a 3 minute long exercise. This is what it takes to lower your level of stress. \nYou can gradually increase the exercise lengths, but remember to exercise three times every day. Over one week of exercising you will notice the effects in your body.\n\nProbably the best investment you will ever make. If you use it!\n\nOther options:\n1. Turn the sea wave sounds on and off (the waves are synchronized to the specific 0,1Hz frequency)\n2. Choose the duration of the exercise; remember that the secret to stress   relief is practicing several times every day, so make it simple, use the Respiroguide!\n\nFor details access the following websites:\n- www.heartintelligence.com in English\n- www.nuvitaal.nu and www.hartfocus.nl in Dutch\n- www.emnergie.com in French\n************\nWe do appreciate your feedback!\n\nVital-EQ, the International Institute for Stress Management."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

      "label": "The Isochronic Tone Generator does just what it says: You can create any Isochronic Tone (between 0.01 an 50Hz) with a carrier between 50 and 999Hz. \n\nYou can also mix the tone with your own music, set the wave volume in the mix, set a timer (up to 59 mins), program target isochronic frequencies for your brain entrainment sessions, use presets to start easy entrainment sessions and memory slots to put your favorite tones.\n\nAs simple as it gets... Enjoy!\n\nFEATURES:\n=======\n\n* Variable carrier tone\n* Variable isochronic tone\n* Fine tune for carrier, isochronic and target frequencies\n* Mix the tone with your own music\n* Wave volume for better mixing\n* Timer (up to 59 minutes)\n* Entrainment sessions: Just set the target frequency using the black indicator below the isochronic tone.\n* Presets (sleep, relax, awake and meditate)\n* Memory slots: for having your favorite tones one tap away\n\n------------------------\n\nIsochronic tones are regular beats of a single tone used for brainwave entrainment. Similar to monaural beats, the interference pattern that produces the beat is outside the brain so headphones are not required for entrainment to be effective. They differ from monaural beats, which are constant sine wave pulses rather than entirely separate pulses of a single tone. As the contrast between noise and silence is more pronounced than the constant pulses of monaural beats, the stimulus is stronger and has a greater effect on brain entrainment (taken from: http://www.mindalive.com/articleeleven.htm)\n\n-------------------------\n\nIsochronic beats are not intended to treat or cure any disease, nor should any of the subject matter presented on this app or website be taken as medical advice.

At the end of the Clean 9 programme it will work out your total inches lost and total weight lost and record the information so you can review it at a later time or when you are thinking about doing another cleanse.\n\nAnother handy function of the app is that you can view all the approved \"Free Foods\" in the app, again, without having to refer to your programme instruction booklet - handy when you are on the move or shopping."

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916/\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/\n\nBest of 2021\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1591083005/"

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "RESPIROGUIDE PRO: THE NEWEST VERSION, MORE PERSONAL \n\n“Simple and amazingly effective for better concentration, stress anxiety, ADHD and trauma healing” –  Kees L. Blase, medical physicist,  National Centre for Stress Management,The Netherlands.\n\nRespiroguide PRO is brought to you by Vital-EQ the International Institute for Stress Management.\n**********\nTHE ABC of STRESSMANAGEMENT\nRespiroguide uses the most recent research in neurosciences and stress management, research that has been condensed into the most convenient one-touch tool. The knowledge is based on the heart's resonant frequency  which induces heart and breath coherence.\nRespiroguide Pro will train the reflexes and so the elasticity of your vascular system. This will help in lowering blood pressure, is effective in coping with stress and anxiety, and enhances better concentration at school and work. \nHeart rate is a dynamic body function that varies in each moment. \nIn an Active state (sympathic activity) heart rate increases, \nin a Calm and relaxed state heart rate decreases. \nCardiac Coherence is the Balanced  state of the autonomic nervous system in which you feel safe and happy, free from fear and anxiety and overstressed reactions.\nThe body can be brought into the state of Cardiac Coherence through guided breathing. Guiding the resonance frequency (Respiroguide Pro) can be compared with guiding someone on a swing by pushing at just the right moment to optimise their swing.   \nEach individual has his or her own personal respiratory frequency (resonance frequency) in which cardiac coherence is optimal. This ideal respiratory frequency is between 0,06 Hz and 0,12 Hz. The Respiroguide Pro will help you to find your personal resonance frequency, which depends on the length and width of your blood vessels. \nYou can set the guide in four different frequencies:\n1. Average: F6: 6 breaths a minute = 0,1 Hz\n2. Average: F5: 5 breaths a minute = 0,083 Hz\n3. Slow: F4: 4 breaths a minute = 0,066 Hz\n4. Quick: F7: 7 breaths a minute = 0,118 Hz\nTo find your resonance frequency it’s important to experience all four breathing frequencies and notice:\n-which one provides the most balanced feeling\n-which one can be comfortably sustained for a period of at least 5 minutes\n-which one gives a maximum amplitude in Heart Rate Variability. This last function requires  access to a HRV-biofeedback instrument with a Cardiac Coherence Coach.\nCardiac Coherence Coaches can be found at  www.hartfocus.nl (Netherlands) and www.heartintelligence.com/VitalEQ  (Europe, Asea). \nThe Respiroguide Pro is a medical tested safe device. More than 20 years of research showed positive effects:lowering bloodpressure, less anxiety, enhancing performance, coping with stress, effective treatment of trauma.Take care: do not  inhale too deeply, this occasionally make you dizzy. Focusing on the exhale is the most effective way. \n\nQUICK START: press the play button and just breathe in and out with the yellow dot. Breathe in as the dot goes up, breathe out as it goes down.\n\nThe default setting is a 3 minute long exercise. This is what it takes to lower your level of stress. \nYou can gradually increase the exercise lengths, but remember to exercise three times every day. Over one week of exercising you will notice the effects in your body.\n\nProbably the best investment you will ever make. If you use it!\n\nOther options:\n1. Turn the sea wave sounds on and off (the waves are synchronized to the specific 0,1Hz frequency)\n2. Choose the duration of the exercise; remember that the secret to stress   relief is practicing several times every day, so make it simple, use the Respiroguide!\n\nFor details access the following websites:\n- www.heartintelligence.com in English\n- www.nuvitaal.nu and www.hartfocus.nl in Dutch\n- www.emnergie.com in French\n************\nWe do appreciate your feedback!\n\nVital-EQ, the International Institute for Stress Management."

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

Health CSV Importer supports all quantity data types in Apple Health, except Activity Summaries, Stand Hours, Exercise Time, and Nike Fuel.\n\nTo see how easy it is, just watch the preview video (no sound). Note: while we use iCloud Drive in the preview video, iCloud Drive does not need to be enabled in order to perform an import.

      "label": "The Best way to train jump rope workouts offline in your pocket!\n\nYou are looking for a fun way to get fit using jump ropes?\nThen Jump Rope App will give you access to quick and effective workouts that fit your busy schedule. Experience a fun new way to get a full-body workout, anywhere. If you're looking to push your calorie burning, you should start skipping with our jump rope app.\n\nJumping rope burns more than 10 calories a minute while strengthening your legs, butt, shoulders, and arms. And it doesn't take long to reap great rewards. You can burn more than 200 calories in two 10-minute sessions each day, 1000 calories a week.\n\nJumping rope is also a great way to fit in an effective cardio session when you're on the go—just toss your jump rope in your carry-on! You'll probably feel completely energized after jumping rope too.\n\nTry adding our workout routines to your existing strength plan, or do it alone as a cardio workout. Add a jump rope to high-intensity interval training (HIIT). One of the best methods to get in a fast, efficient workout is to use jump rope for your HIIT routine. And while running is a popular choice when it comes to HIIT workouts, there are several reasons to pick up a jump rope instead.\n\nThen what are you waiting for?\n\nApp Features:\n\n- Big library of 5 - 30 minutes jump rope workouts, anytime, anywhere in your pocket. Total offline.\n- Build-in workout will guide you to get you lean, strong and fit.\n- Screen for checking your workout details before starting a workout with a muscle group.\n- Big library  exercises with a muscle group demonstration\n- Activity tracking makes it easy to follow your workout completion, progress, and total calories burned.\n- Heavy rope jump rope workouts\n- Customizable build-in interval timer you can manage your high-intensity interval workouts.\n- Learn new things with the articles.\n- Tutorial for beginners to start jumping\n\nFAQs:\n\nIs the Jump Rope app available in multiple languages?\nNo, currently it’s only available in English. But we are working hard on it to make it available in multiple languages.\n\nDo I need any other equipment to do these workouts?\nNo. All you need is your jump ropes, this app, and enough space to jump no gym required. But for some CrossFit style workouts, you will need kettlebells and barbells which are optional.\n\nWhat do the workouts look like?\nJump Rope App workouts are built around different combinations of jump rope and bodyweight exercises to help you burn calories, build strength, and improve endurance. Workouts range from 5 to 30 minutes.\n\nJoin the Jump Rope Community:\nInstagram: @jumpropetraining"

Although there are many similar apps on the market (e.g. Fitness App, Calorie counter...), most of them focus mainly on “numbers”, such as how many calories the user has eaten and how long the user should exercise to get rid of those calories, or sending the user notifications when they should get up to exercise or if they have eaten too much.\n\nFoodyLife’ is an app that helps users track their daily diet by allowing them to keep their own food diary. The app shows neither calories nor numbers; instead, users have only to take a picture, enter their diet information, then they are able their overall diet balance. It is very simple and highly effective. Users can explore their eating habits visually, improving self-consciousness about eating habits."

Consult a dietitian and share a pdf (using email for example) of the diary, or of analyses of links between diet and symptoms\n- see the diary notes (including photos) made on your smartphone back on a tablet, and vice versa\n- give your care provider or dietitian immediate insight into your food and symptoms diary\n- gain insight into the nutritional value of your diet: the app calculates the amount energy (calories), proteins, fats, minerals, vitamins your diet provides. If desired, you can also use the app without displaying the nutritional value of your food\n\nYou can use the app if you suspect a food allergy, but also if you think that symptoms are related to food hypersensitivity. In the app's diary you note what you ate and drank, and what your symptoms are, for example stomach or bowel disorders, or skin reactions such as rashes, aggravation of itching, or pimples / acne. In the app's reports you can then see which food item(s) was/were used prior to a specific symptom."

You can choose to jump rope anytime, anywhere.\n\nCurrently, Apple Watch allows you to track multiple workouts including  running or cycling, and swimming, but not jump rope.\n\nOften, counting your jumps during your jump rope workout is essential and is an important aspect. YaoYao utilizes Apple Watch’s motion sensors to calculate your jumps. YaoYao literally costs you no more than an ordinary jump rope.\n\n- 2022/02/20 New AirPods Mode：Count with AirPods motion sensor, no Apple Watch required（Support AirPods 3/Pro/Max/Beats Fit Pro）\n\nFeatures :\n\n- Jumps counting (includes support for double unders)\nFor every 100 jumps, the app encourages you with voice feedback of your current progress - so that you can focus on your posture and avoid glancing at the Watch to check your jump counts.\n\n- Live Count\nLive counts of your jumps are displayed along with the voice feedback.\n\n- Exercise time record\n\n- Jump speed (Speed) record/Scrolling Speed (Speed of jumps over the past minute)\n\n- Record the number of consecutive jumps\nAlong with the jump speed, the app also counts the number of jumps in one go.\n\n- Heart rate record\nMax heart rate warning tip.\n\n- Calorie burn value\n\n- HIIT mode\nTime or Jumps Interval\n\n- iPhone real time display (Live Count):\nOpen the iPhone app during exercise and display the jump data on the iPhone\n\n- Syncs with iOS Health app.\n\nYaoYao syncs and stores health data to the iOS Health app from Apple.

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

      "label": "The Box breathing technique is a breathing exercise commonly used in meditation and yoga for its anti-stress benefits. Box breathing will help you against anxiety.\n\nBy the voluntary control of the frequency between exhalation and inhalation, the type of breathing (abdominal, costal) I will learn to work better and better, my muscles involved in this breathing gesture (diaphragm, intercostals, etc.).\nThrough the combined effect of better blood oxygenation and neuro-vegetative reflexes, by exercising a voluntary control on our way of breathing, we can rise our level of vigilance.\nIt is commonly felt that increased expiration time (3 minimum exhalation times for 1 inhalation time) promotes relaxation. It is commonly felt that an increase of the inspiratory amplitude with a brief expiration (3 times on the inspiration for 1 expiration time) will be more challenging.\n\nBox breathing benefits :\n\n• from 4 to 10 cycles:\n- to find his calm in case of nervousness,\n- to find a little energy,\n- to refocus quickly in the present\n\n• over 20 cycles and more:\n- a deeper relaxation,\n- a discreet relaxation, anytime, anywhere, in any position (sitting, standing, lying), an anti-stress action,\n- an improvement in the concentration at the same time as relaxation,\n- a regular practice promotes an awareness and progressive relaxation of the diaphragm.\"\n\"Considering the benefits of his action, we are encouraged to learn and feel its different effects to include, this work of breathing in our daily lives.\n\nAs a first step, you can focus on learning about abdominal breathing, then in a second time deepen the learning and automation of square breathing.\n\nHow to perform box breathing exercise :\n\n• Straighten the upper body with the intention of growing, stretching the axis of the spine and opening the chest.\n\n• For square breathing, breathe through the nose while keeping the lower jaw relaxed.\n\n• Print a flexible movement of the abdomen that accompanies inspiration and exhalation: this is abdominal breathing:\n- Inspiration: the abdomen swells in a fluid movement\n- Expiration: the abdomen deflates in the same fluidity.\n\n• Once the abdominal breathing is installed, start the square breathing: the four phases of breathing have each the same duration:\n- Inspiration (3/4/5/6 / ... seconds)\n- Full lung retention (3/4/5/6 / ... seconds)\n- Expiration (3/4/5/6 / ... seconds)\n- Retention empty lungs (3/4/5/6 / ... seconds)"

I knew exactly what you needed to ideally time contractions!\n\nTiming a contraction is easy, press Start to start and Stop to stop. But I discovered personally how stressful it gets and that you can easily forget about pushing any buttons. That's why this App lets you hear a small beep at 60 and 90 seconds, even when you turn off the App, to make sure you don't forget!\n\nDuring labor it's very important that you call the midwife and help at the right times. That's why this App automatically calculates exactly two most important things you need to know:\n- The duration of the contraction\n- The time that has passed since the last contraction\nIt will show you a beautiful summary of these calculations so you can immediately see if you can call your midwife already. Afterwards you can even share this overview with your midwife or yourself for the records!\n\nThe birth of your child is one of the most important times in your life, so do yourself a favor!\nDownload this App, and be prepared!\n\nTerms of use\nhttps://graafict.nl/termsofuse.html"

Use any of the available, most popular 1 Rep Max formulas to estimate your 1 rep maximum weight and keep a log to see your progress over time.\n\nSimply select a lift type, enter a weight and a number of repetitions (up to 10), and tap the Calculate button to see your 1 Rep Max.\n\nWith My 1 Rep Max Premium, you can create your own custom lifts and use more than 10 repetitions to perform calculations.\n\nA Note About Safety:\nOne rep maximum calculators are used to estimate the maximum amount you can lift. The degree of accuracy can vary significantly depending on your experience with weight training as well as your muscular composition. Most one rep maximum calculators are designed for experienced strength trainers so, if you are inexperienced, you may find your actual one rep maximum is much lower because your body is not accustomed to the stress of lifting heavy weight. Because it can be dangerous to attempt to lift your estimated maximum, always have a spotter with you. Seriously.\n\nMy 1 Rep Max will never bother you to request a rating or review. However,  if you'd like to take the time to rate or review it, you can do so from the Settings screen and that would be swell."

      "label": "WHAT IS BRUXAPP?\nBruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.\nDesigned by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. \n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nBruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:\n- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.\n- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.\n- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.\n- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.\n- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.\n- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.\n\nWHY is BruxApp needed? \nBruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

      "label": "Mood Mint combines a variety of psychological techniques to help boost your mood, and reduce stress, anxiety and depression.\n\nThere are 4 main components to Mood Mint (all backed by hard science):\n\n1) COGNITIVE BIAS MODIFICATION\nAttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is a computer-based therapy that gets the user to repeatedly select positive information over negative information. The aim of the game is to tap the positive image as quickly as possible. In this way, CBM helps train your brain to automatically focus more on positive information in your everyday life.The result: less stress and a happier you. \n\nStudies show that Bias Modification can effectively lower anxiety with as little as 2 hours of treatment. A number of studies have shown that CBM can also help to alleviate depression. After several weeks of CBM, participants showed increased activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex – the area of the brain associated with more positive, happier thinking.\n\nMood Mint allows you to fully customize the Cognitive Bias Modification game – edit, delete, or add your own images for a personalized CBM experience. Add pictures of things you are grateful for, happy events and people that are special to you and give them a positive charge. These will also help to trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals during each training session.\n\n\nIf you would like to find out more about Atttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (ACBM), and how it is being used to treat anxiety and depression,  please visit BiasModification.com\n\n\n2) HAPPY NOTES\nSlides will appear during the cognitive bias modification session. These are loaded with bite-sized mental health tips, facts, stats, techniques and exercises to help boost your mood.  You can take your time reading the slides and carrying out the exercises as the timer will stop while they are on screen. \n\nAll of the 'Happy Notes' are based on leading research and theory in psychology and neuroscience fields. Each and every one of them can help to lower stress and anxiety, and improve overall mental health and wellbeing. \n\nGo to Settings to edit and add your own happy notes to the program.\n\n3) POSITIVE WORD SEARCH\nJust as focusing your attention on negative or threatening information can trigger the release of stress chemicals like cortisol and adrenaline, so focusing on positive information can trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals like serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.\n\nResearch in the fields of psychology and neuroscience  have shown that our brains automatically releases feel-good neurochemicals whenever we focus on a positive word.\n\nThe word search is designed to trigger these ‘feel-good’ chemicals by getting you to focus on positive words. You need to find all 4 of the words listed below the letter grid to complete the word search. Drag your finger over the letters in the grid to highlight each of the words listed.\n\nTo maximise the positive psychological effect, try to think of all the positive things you associate with each word as you search for it.\n\n4) BREATHING EXERCISE\nThere is a guided breathing exercise at the end of each training session. Focusing on your breathing helps to ground you in the present, and triggers the parasympathetic (‘rest and digest’) response, helping you to instantly  feel  a little calmer. Focused breathing is an important element of mindful meditation, and it comes with a long list of mental health benefits.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that focused breathing meditation alone can help to lower stress, reduce anxiety and depression.\n\nHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN?\nThe short answer – as often as you need to. For optimal results, you should aim to train for around 5 to 10 minutes per day,  and anytime in between if you're feeling stressed, anxious or upset.\n\nTo complete the program, you need to earn 10 000 points."

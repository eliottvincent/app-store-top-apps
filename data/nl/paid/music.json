      "label": "Spring Reverb models the sound and character of popular spring reverbs found in guitar amplifiers, popularized by Surf, Garage and Rockabilly music. Spring takes this a step further by allowing manipulation of physical parameters not normally available in a real spring tank. The results vary from faithful recreations of real springs to distinctive new sounds that push the physical boundaries of reverb. Guitarists love the revered surfer vibe but all creative musicians will find that Spring makes any synthesizer, drum, or vocal stand out in a mix. \n\nThis vintage reverb sound originally derived from the reflections of sound waves traveling through springs has been given an overhaul for the 21st century and beyond. Eventide Spring contains two different sized ‘spring tanks’ along with the ability to morph between one and three springs. Easily program The Ribbon to seamlessly transition between any two settings in real-time! The added tube-amp-style tremolo can be routed before or after the spring resulting in an unrivaled ability to craft your own unique reverb sound. Alter the intensity by changing the tremolo depth and adjust the tremolo rate in Hz, or note value when tempo-synced to your project.\n\nFeatures:\n- Artist presets by Matt Lange, Nick Hook, and Nu-Trix.\n- Tempo Sync reverb decay to your DAW\n- Craft original sounds by changing the number of springs and damping frequency\n- Alter overall resonance by selecting the size of the spring tank \n- Tube-amp-style tremolo that can be routed pre- or post-reverb\n- Create chorus-like effects by altering Modulation Level\n- The Ribbon controller allows for dynamic modification of several knobs at once to easily morph between settings\n- Programmable Hotswitch provides the ability to jump instantly to an alternate sound at the push of a button\n- iOS version works as a standalone app, AudioUnit v3 effect, or Inter-App Audio effect"

      "label": "BLEASS Motion FX contains 11 different effects which you can modulate precisely thanks to an intuitive and comprehensive sequencer. \nChoose an effect and dynamically modulate it thanks to an intuitive and versatile motion sequencer. Thanks to its very low CPU usage, load as many instances of Motion FX as you want and unveil new sonic territories!\n\nEffects included are:\n- Low Pass Filter\n- High Pass Filter\n- Band Pass Filter\n- Volume\n- Pan\n- Pitch Shifter\n- Frequency Shifter\n- Ring Modulator\n- Warmth\n- Bit Crusher\n- Delay\n\nEach effect has a parameter automated by the sequencer and can have one or more secondary parameters. Pick an effect and then modulate it dynamically thanks to the motion sequencer. When switching effects, the motion sequencer keeps its state to invite you to new sound design ideas!\n\n_____Sequencer:\n\nThe sequencer offers 4 to 16 steps, each step has a value and a curve. You can set the value by touching and/or dragging the step and set the curve by tapping the curve icon at the bottom of each step. Curves choices are: Step, Ramp Up, Ramp Down, Ramp and Smooth Ramp.\n- Length controls the number of steps (4 to 16).\n- Resolution controls the duration (in bars) of each step. (from 1/32 bar up to 4 bars)\n- Grid snap: when set to ON, steps values snap to the displayed grid when you change their values.\n- Reset: resets all steps to their default values (default value depends on the current selected effect).\n- Amount sets the sequencer’s amplitude.\n- Randomness sets the range in which step values are randomly chosen.\n- Smooth sets the interpolation time between steps.\n\n\n_____Effects:\n\n- Low Pass Filter, High Pass Filter and Band Pass Filter:\nThe sequencer modulates the frequency value of the filter.\nA slider controls the resonance of the filter.\n\n- Volume:\nThe sequencer modulates the gain.\n\n- Pan:\nThe sequencer modulates the pan.\n\n- Pitch shifter:\nThe sequencer modulates the pitch. The pitch range is +/- 12 semitones.\nGrain Size sets the density of the granular pitch shifter.\nGrid sets the sequencer grid to Chromatic, Major or Minor. Set Grid Snap to ON to quantize the pitch to the selected scale.\n\n- Frequency shifter:\nThe sequencer modulates the frequency. The frequency range is +/- 1kHz.\nFine adds an offset to the frequency set by the sequencer.\nIf Stereo is On, Fine value for the right channel is the opposite to the left channel.\n\n- Ring modulator:\nThe sequencer modulates the frequency. The frequency range is 1Hz to 10kHz\nFine adds an offset to the frequency set by the sequencer.\nIf Stereo is On, Fine value for the right channel is the opposite to the left channel.\n\n- Warmth:\nWarmth is a waveshaper. The sequencer modulates the strength of the waveshaper.\nDrive adds a gain before the waveshaper.\n\n- Bit crusher:\nThe sequencer modulates the rate of the bit crusher.\nDepth controls the depth of the bit crusher.\n\n- Delay\nThe signal is delayed by a time set by the sequencer. The time range is 0 to 50ms.\nFeedback sets the amount of delay feedback.\nWhen Ping Pong is On, the delayed signal bounces back and forth between the left and right channels.\nStereo sets the difference between left and right delays.\n\n- A Dry/Wet control lets you set the balance between the dry and wet signals.\n- The random preset generator (dice button next to the presets manager) only affects the parameters of the current selected FX. \n\nCheck out www.bleass.com for video tutorials and more info!\n\n\n* PLEASE NOTE: this is an Audio Unit Effect plugin (AUv3) which requires a compatible host such as AUM, GarageBand, Cubasis, BM3 or Auria. Standalone mode also available for demo purposes."

      "label": "Undulator is Eventide’s classic modulated tremolo effect from the iconic H3000 effects processor. This unique, rhythmic effect combines ethereal feedback and detuned echos, run through an AM / FM modulated tremolo. Whether used for manipulating samples or adding movement to strings, pads, guitars, and keys, Undulator is a muse for creative musicians. Add Undulator into your plug-ins collection for the most playable tremolo-style effect on your DAW or iOS device.\n\nUndulator excels at evolving pads, sync’d chops, and time-lapsing dreamy soundscapes. Combined with a multi-tap delay and powerful tremolo, Undulator’s controls give any sound sustain and shape. This is perfect for transforming ordinary synths, keys, guitars, and even vocals into evolving pads, tempo synced production elements, or ethereal and fluctuant delays. Simply put, Undulator can make shorter sounds into longer layered effects, and give sustaining sounds shape and rhythmic character.\n\nUse the Ribbon to morph tremolo patterns into vacillating and varying rhythmic territories. This can be effective for calling attention to synth pads and creating a state of flux or rarity which is otherwise arduous to achieve.\n\n- Turn up the MIX to increase the dry/effect ratio\n- Utilize multiple modulation waveform shapes and sources to alter the rhythmic feel\n- Subtly finesse detuning of delays by using SPREAD\n- Add FEEDBACK to accentuate delays or create infinite loops\n- The Secondary LFO determines how fast the depth and speed modulation “wiggle” their targets\n- Lock the tremolo to tempo using SYNC\n- RETRIG at the top of the waveform for a more predictable effect\n- RIBBON lets you ‘play’ the effect in real-time and provides dynamic and fluid control to morph back and forth between the settings of your choice\n- SLOW/FAST button toggles on a “Slow LFO” mode. Holding it down to “BRAKE” temporarily slows down the LFOs at a constant rate until released\n- Update the tremolo speed in real time using the TAP button\n- Available as an AUv3 plug-in and Standalone App"

This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

New functions include the ability to play chords with up to four-note polyphony, an easy-to-use arpeggiator for rhythmic pattern creation, a real time looping recorder with unlimited overdubbing capacity, a tempo-synchronizable stereo ping pong delay module, and the Bender -- a wide-range stereo time modulation effect module. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App also supports AUv3 Audio Unit extensions, which allows multiple instances of this powerful instrument to be used simultaneously within compatible iOS apps supporting AUv3.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY \nIntroduced by Moog in 1970, the Minimoog Model D served as the archetype for all electronic keyboards that followed. It gave users the ability to design their own sounds, translating imagination into reality. The Minimoog’s portability, affordability and accessibility made it the go-to instrument for musicians looking to expand beyond the traditional sounds of the time. Bernie Worrell used the Minimoog Model D to establish Parliament Funkadelic’s futuristic funk sound. Kraftwerk employed the Minimoog Model D on the successful concept album Autobahn, sparking an entirely new genre. Gary Numan replaced his live band’s guitars with Minimoog Model Ds, creating the prototype for industrial music. The classic sound of the Minimoog Model D can be heard on Bob Marley’s Catch A Fire, Michael Jackson’s Thriller and Dr. Dre’s The Chronic; Detailed in the mini-doc series “A Brief History Of The Minimoog”. \n\nFEATURES \n• Ships with over 160 presets (hundreds more available in the Minimoog Model D App Store) \n• Up to 4-notes of polyphony \n• Easily share presets and audio recordings with friends \n• Arpeggiator module with note-hold and chord latch capability \n• Stereo ping-pong delay effect \n• Bender time modulation effect \n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing \n• Selectable envelope shapes and triggering behavior \n• Effortless MIDI CC mapping \n• Seamlessly backup presets to iCloud \n• Play mode for easier panel and keyboard interaction \n• A new take on the classic feedback/overload path \n\nSUPPORTS\n• All 64-bit iOS devices\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions (Including GarageBand)\n• MPE Controller Support \n• Ableton Link \n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI \n• MIDI Program Change Support \n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers \n• Share over AirDrop, Mail, or other iOS applications"

      "label": "Built for Live performance and hands free use, Quantiloop recreates the simplicity of a hardware loop pedal in an iOS app. Attach a MIDI foot controller and control it the way you want. No MIDI controller at hand; just preset your loop length, enable auto–record or a count–in and your loops will automatically close, no hands or feet required. Big onscreen controls allow for easy configuration and tactile control by vocalists or beat boxers. Focus on your performance instead of fiddling with dip switches or complex menu’s.\n\nBe Creative\n\nCreate 4 tracks with endless layers of overdubs to build your performance. Record a Chorus, Verse and Bridge and switch between them seamlessly or create a 1 bar percussie loop on track one, a 4 bar chord progression on track two and layer a bass line on top, all in perfect synchronisation.\n\nRhythm Guide\n\nThe builtin rhythm guide provides a rhythmic backing. Use the internal metronome for practice, import drum loops from virtually anywhere or host and control your favourite rhythm apps to enhance your performance. MIDI master lets you control MIDI hardware, and MIDI slave lets Quantiloop follow it. Ableton Link lets you even play in time over WiFi with external apps and devices. Quantisation aligns your actions to the nearest measure or beat so you stay in time, and real-time tempo control sets the pace. Prefer setting your own pace, disable quantisation and Quantiloop will react to your actions with minimum latency to create tight synchronised recordings.\n\nFX\n\nAssign up to 3 simultaneous effects to the input. Use the built-in transpose to covert your guitar into a bass, or host your guitar amp sim directly in Quantiloop. The results will be recorded into your loops.\nOr assign up to 3 simultaneous track effects to the output. Use the tape stop to add drama, introduce a key change to build up your performance, or host an Inter-App audio/AU reverb processor. Track FX may be assigned to a single track, all tracks or the combined output.\n\nFeatures\n\n•\tFree, Synced and Paralel,Serial, Mixed Playing Styles\n•\tMultiple Quantise Modes\n•\tMultiple Stop Modes\n•\tUnique Dub Mode and Mute Mode\n•\tUnlimited Overdubs\n•\tOverdub Decay\n•\tUndo / Redo\n•\tAuto Record\n•\tHigh quality stereo audio\n•\tClear loop status display\n•\tRhythm guide with optional auto-start, auto-stop and count-in\n•\tAudible and Visual Metronome\n•\tSend start, stop and host sync to hosted rhythm apps.\n•\tSync to host when embedded in an Inter-App-Audio host\n•\tReal-time Tempo Control\n•\tExtensive MIDI control\n•\tMultiple Assignments per MIDI controller (tap, hold, double tap)\n•\tMIDI Program Change support for changing presets\n•\tSupports Audiobus and Inter-App-Audio and Audio Units (AUv3)\n•\tIndividual outputs for each track and rhythm\n•\tSynchronise to other apps and devices with Ableton Link\n•\tMIDI clock sync (both slave and master)\n•\t4 physical/iaa/au/audiobus inputs routable to any track\n•\t8 outputs (main, monitor, track 1-4, rhythm, input out)\n•\t3 assignable input Fx, including transpose, reverb and IAA, AUv3\n•\t3 assignable track Fx, including transpose, reverse, tape stop, fade and IAA, AUv3\n•\tCloud (iCloud, Dropbox, Audioshare …) import / export\n•\tAudioCopy/Paste\n•\tOpen In\n•\tStore Phrase Presets in unlimited banks with 100 presets each\n•\tIndividual Volume and panning controls for each track"

      "label": "\"Super powerful plugin... Highly recommended.\" - The REAPER Blog\nhttps://reaperblog.net/2022/01/bass-mint/\n\nUnfiltered Audio's Bass Mint is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nBass Mint is a simple-to-use but immensely powerful bass and sub enhancement utility. You can use it to add extra bass to your kick drums, or to make podcast voices more full-bodied.\n\nWith five different modes, Bass Mint can either accentuate and clean up existing bass in your input signal, or it can synthesize new bass from scratch! The SYNTHESIZE and RESONATE modes can be tuned to specific frequencies, allowing you to make any percussive hits sound more in tune with the rest of your song (For extremely quick tuning, dozens of presets are included with correct frequencies for all note values).\n\nBass Mint includes multiple methods of making your bass sit better in the mix. The ANTI-RUMBLE filter removes all inaudible bass from your track, clearing up some headroom to make the audible frequencies louder. MID ONLY affects only center-channel bass, while MONO BASS places all bass below the cutoff directly into the center of the stereo field. The CLARITY knob acts as a quick de-mud control to scoop out some of the mids.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Bass Mint has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Bass Mint can be used on tablets and phones with ease."

      "label": "With SonoSequencr you can create individual sequences to perform recurring tasks with just one click.\n\nIf you have multiple Sonos devices and want to play a radio station on all of them, it takes some time to set this up. With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

      "label": "Steel Guitar PRO is a highly advanced guitar processor that combines cutting-edge realtime audio generation with a truly expressive control interface. It provides many unique guitar models, built-in amps & FX processing, MIDI control, AUv3, and wide-ranging customizability.\n\n:: Control Surface ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO features a powerful yet familiar control interface. Simply touch the strings to “pick,” and drag the slide bar to modulate pitch. By enabling enhanced slide control, you can even use multiple touches to tilt the slide bar, or dampen the strings. Fretboard dimension, string spacing, and pick guard size are all configurable. A high level of resolution enables minute pitch control and realistic vibrato. Settings let you vary guitar tone, sustain and release times, touch behavior, slide bar auxiliary control, handedness, and more.\n\n:: Guitars ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO provides you with an arsenal of guitars to choose from: unique examples of humbuckers, single coils, P90s, and more. Instruments include many 6 string guitars, as well as 8- and 10-string steel guitar variants. Each family of instruments comes with many tuning to choose from, but you can also create and save your own. In addition, you have up to seven virtual “pedals” to bend individual or collections of string — much like a pedal steel. The pedals can be actuated by slightly tilting the device, or via MIDI, or even with the fretting touch. All of this is configurable by the user.\n\n:: Built-In FX Processing ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO incorporates a virtual signal chain where you can put amps and FX in any combination. The included dozen amps and 20 FX are all custom tuned to evoke the best tones from the guitar processor. Each amp or effect features multiple parameters to precisely modify its tone and feel. These parameters are MIDI-mappable, so that you can control them via an external device. The amp collection covers a broad spectrum from bell-like cleans to thick overdrive. The FX include many analog inspired “pedals” that range from overdrives, distortions, mods, delays, reverbs, to beyond.\n\n:: AUv3 & MIDI ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO can also be used as an AUv3 MIDI plugin. We developed a custom MIDI sub-protocol so that Steel Guitar PRO and its powerful control interface can run seamlessly inside an AUv3 host. You can also use a traditional MIDI keyboard or device to play Steel Guitar PRO, which readily accommodates MIDI pitch & mod wheels, and key velocity as well. \n\n:: Useful Features ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO includes a comprehensive preset management system that allows you to save, modify, and share any number of your “rigs.” The standalone app also includes a handy “tape deck” where you can record, play, loop and import/export audio. MIDI learn feature is easy and intuitive to use, but also offers deeper customization. All audio processing is done in the highest resolution, natively and without resampling at rates up to 96kHz. The fluid user interface integrates readily with many different AUv3 hosts."

The character, harmonic complexity and mystique of the Moog Model 15’s modules, from the legendary Moog 921–series oscillators and 904A Low Pass Filter, to the coveted 907 Fixed Filter Bank have been painstakingly preserved. \n\nIn order to develop the most immersive and expressive modular interface possible, the Model 15 App has been designed utilizing Apple’s new Metal advanced graphics engine. This ensures that all zooming, panning and modular patching throughout the application feels completely natural, something that would have been impossible otherwise.\n \nThe Model 15 App features both monophonic and 4-voice polyphonic operation is easily commanded via 4 seamlessly integrated controllers. Simple swipes and taps provide instant access to a traditional Moog keyboard, 1150 ribbon controller, 8-step sequencing arpeggiator and the award-winning Animoog keyboard with 22 built-in scales and polyphonic modulation capabilities.\n \nAlso included are extended features which expand the capabilities of the app beyond the traditional offerings of the hardware Moog Model 15. These include total MIDI integration, assignment for external control, use as a MIDI controller, dedicated Audio Bridge and MIDI Bridge modules, looping recorder module with overdubbing, a master ping-pong delay module and a new extension cabinet that includes additional amplifiers and voltage-controlled reversible attenuators that can be used for effects like ring-modulation.\n \nBecause the Model 15 App utilizes Apple’s Metal technology, only 64-bit devices are supported. Compatible devices include iPhone 5s or newer, iPod touch 6 or newer, iPad Air or newer, and the iPad Pro.\n\nThe Model 15 App requires iOS version 12.4 or later to work.\n \n\nAdditional Features\n• Ships with over 160 unique presets\n• Recreates the sound of a hardware Moog Model 15 modular synthesizer\n• Easily share presets and recordings with anyone\n• Tutorial patches to assist all experience levels\n• Intuitive patching and cable coloring\n• Support for landscape and portrait modes\n• Voltage-controlled stereo ping-pong delay\n• Expressive sequencing arpeggiator\n• Moog 1150 Ribbon controller\n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing\n• Up to two controllers on-screen (iPad only)\n• Optional left-handed UI operation\n \nSupports\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions\n• 3D Touch and Apple Pencil integration for after pressure\n• Note-per-channel MIDI controllers  \n• Ableton Link\n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• MIDI Bridge and Audio Bridge\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI\n• MIDI Program Change\n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers\n• Typing keyboards for shortcuts and musical typing\n• AudioCopy, AudioPaste and AudioShare"

Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com.

      "label": "Unfiltered Audio's Tails is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nUnfiltered Audio joined forces with electronic music superstar BT to create Tails, the world's most harmonic reverb.\n\nTails utilizes a novel double-buffered technology to create two separate reverbs in parallel. The twist comes with special threshold swapping: Whenever Tails detects a major change in amplitude or tone, it can smoothly swap between the two reverbs. Additionally, Tails can auto-duck on its inputs and outputs.\n\nThis keeps your reverb as clean as possible. With auto-ducking on attacks, you can keep the metallic noise of percussive hits out of your reverbs. Alternatively, you can keep passing tones and blue notes out of your melodic echoes so that your reverb is free of dissonance.\n\nEven without its innovative ducking and swapping, Tails is the most flexible reverb in your arsenal. Two of Unfiltered Audio's classic BYOME reverb algorithms (Renoun and Deep) are available with a Spatial mode inspired by Silo and a brand new Shimmer mode designed to BT's exacting specifications. In true Unfiltered Audio fashion, a global Sample Rate knob affects the sampling rate of the entire DSP algorithm, stretching your reverb tails out into crispy, lo-fi oblivion.\n\nFinally, Tails is built to be performed. Your MIDI keyboard's Pitch and Mod wheels can be assigned quickly to a selection of key parameters, while Note messages can be used to manually duck or mute the reverb.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Tails has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Tails can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with Tails will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store. If you have questions and/or suggestions, feel free to contact me via e-mail or facebook."

It’s up to your creativity. The moving cursor will let you follow the rhythm visually, so you never get lost. \n \nThe Odd Metronome offers various Latin, Arabic and metronome rhythms and you can easily create your own patterns. It uses standard rhythmical notation. This will also allow you to construct your rhythms using the popular Long-Short Method which creates rhythms from groups of two or three eight notes. \n \nThree high quality sound samples deliver a low, medium and high beat and give an acoustic feel, making it very comfortable to play with. The Odd Metronome comes with six different sound sets: metronome, cajon, darabuka, drums and tabla, for studying various musical styles.\n \nThe design is intuitive and clean with only those options and buttons that you really need, leaving you to do what you intended to do, study your instrument. \n \n*) Easy to use by intuitive design.\n*) Precise timing technology. \n*) No latency regardless of BPM rate.\n*) Create any odd meter.\n*) Follows the playing rhythm visually.\n*) Presets with different styles of rhythms: metronome, Arabic, Turkish, Ottoman, Latin.\n*) Save your own rhythms.\n*) Different sound sets for different styles: classic metronome, oriental percussion, drum set, tabla, cajun.\n*) Built by and for professional musicians."

Works great that way!\n\n“You can turn a few knobs and make 808s that sound so good you could sell them in a sample pack!” – Casual Chris Youtube Review\n\nThis is a mono instrument. One is probably all you need. But, it can be stacked with AU hosts\n\nExpress yourself. Create your signature sound. Simple controls allow you to easily sculpt your own bass or kick sound.\n\nFAQ – LIMITED EDITION APPS\n\nWhat happens if I get a new iPhone or iPad?\nThe limited edition apps you have already acquired will remain in the app store so that you’ll always be able to download them as long as you have the same iTunes account.\n\nWhat happens after the \"app drop\" release time is over?\nThe apps will remain in the App Store so that you may download updates. After the “app drop”, the price in the app store will go to the maximum price tier. As long as you keep the same iTunes account, you may download updates and copies to new devices for free!\n\nWill the apps still be updated?\nThe apps will be updated for new iOS versions, to ensure that your limited edition apps continue to work as iOS technology progresses.\n\nWill the apps support iPhone?\nWe will try to make most of these apps universal. We’re planning a free universal upgrade to the Bass 808 Synth. While the app is currently iPad only, an iPhone version is on the way and will be available while the app is still on sale.\n\nWill there be open-source? \nWe plan on open-sourcing as much as we can. Some of the code developed for this app has already been added to AudioKit for all developers to use in their projects, free of charge.\n\nAre you still working on your existing apps?\nYes! We are still working on improving all our apps, including Synth One, D1, and FM2. The technology developed as a part of these limited edition apps will help improve all our apps.\n\nHOW CAN I KNOW ABOUT FUTURE SPECIAL APPS?\n\nPlease tell your friends to go to:\n\nAudiokitpro.com/join\n\nJoin the fun! :) \n\nMore details about this app:\naudiokitpro.com/bass808"

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

      "label": "Co-designed with Berlin-based electronic musician Hainbach, Gauss brings the oldschool tape-looping art form to mobile devices. This creative field looper works both standalone and as an Audio Unit effect plugin and puts the possibilities of using looped tapes in your hands. Without the need for scissors.\n\nLike real tape loops Gauss takes you off the grid of your DAW: you can adjust tape speed and direction, even during recording. The flow of your loops will drift organically as the tape follows its own cyclical timeline. \n\nUse overdub, or even multiple instances of the Audio Unit plugin, to create multi-layered ever changing sonic palettes. \n\nWe want this app to be a celebration of digital audio technology, so when audio quality is degraded it will do so in a pleasingly crunchy digital way. For example, recording on low tape speeds will give you longer recording time, but at the cost (or pleasure) of a distinctively lower recording quality. So Gauss mimics the behaviour - not the sound - of magnetic tape.\n\nSet the length of the tape, record and overdub your audio, play around with tape speeds; Gauss captures the essence of two ends of tape stuck together in all its unsynchronised, free-running glory. There's even a unique built-in 4-step polyrhythmic sequencer for sequencing tape-speed changes.\n\n- designed as a standalone field recorder and an Audio Unit effect plugin (AUv3) in one package\n- universal app: plugin and standalone work on all iDevices, iOS11 and higher\n- variable tape speed; seamlessly change direction and speed during playback or recording\n- 4-step sequencer lets you trigger (polyrhythmic) tape-speed changes in sync with your host tempo\n- variable inertia for the tape drive motors (from instant to very slow speed changes) \n- built-in multi-mode filter with LFO modulation\n- delay effect with optional host-sync mode\n- “1989” mode uses a special 8 bit/11KHz tape head for a last-century vintage digital sound\n- 45 seconds maximum loop size at 1x speed, proportionally longer at lower speeds (.e.g 90 seconds at half speed, etc.)\n- overdub at any speed or tape direction\n- plugin supports global cross-host preset handling (requires iOS13+, compatible AUv3 host)\n\nFind the user manual at ruismaker.com"

      "label": "Metronomics is not only a metronome, but a tool designed to help build a solid sense of time and rhythmic security.  It's a new kind of metronome -- use Metronomics to generate random patterns, sequenced grooves, or a combination of both to help you practice with more than just your typical click track.  Enough features to keep a professional busy for years or start a beginner on the right track.\n\nThe only metronome that gives you complete control over how subdivisions are played -- add subdivisions of any type (including custom subdivisions like 5/7) and have them played all the time, at random intervals, or in a sequenced pattern.\n\nNow available across platforms for both iOS and macOS -- the most powerful metronome, available for all of your devices.\n\nFeatures:\n- Choose from 40 different samples for each subdivision\n- Generate patterns using random or sequenced variations of different subdivisions\n- Include built-in preset patterns such as claves or ride cymbal patterns\n- Choose any number of beats per measure (with any denominator) you like or practice mixed meters such as 4/4 + 3/8 + 5/4 where the segments of the bar get accented automatically\n- Use any type of subdivision.  Common types like quarter notes, sixteenth notes, eighth triplets, etc, or create your own.  5/7, 23/4, no problem!\n- Take a rhythm and use the \"offset\" feature to move it to different parts of the measure to practice with.\n- Set the metronome to speed up or slow down by a given amount after a set number of measures\n- Have Metronomics start with a count off\n- Set the metronome to run for a certain amount of time\n- Share saved metronomes back and forth with other Metronomics users\n- Track your metronome usage.  App shows how much you've practiced with it each day and total (optionally turn off time tracking)\n- Train yourself with \"independence\" mode where you can set some bars to be inaudible -- keep the time going yourself until the click starts again\n- Variable swing feel -- choose how much each subdivision swings\n- Speech sounds for counting up to 10 that can be assigned to any subdivision (English language only)\n- Play in the background\n- Normalized sounds for good volume\n- Manual (plus videos) describing how to use all the features and hints about how they might be useful\n\nPro subscription features:\n- Wheel view that allows you to visualize the passage of subdivisions with geometric shapes\n- Grid view that lets you easily sequence patterns on a grid much like a drum machine, but with the more-powerful features of Metronomics\n- Inspector mode -- graph your own playing with microphone or MIDI input and see how you line up with the metronome\n- iCloud sync -- sync your saved metronomes via iCloud drive\n- MIDI output -- set subdivisions to send MIDI data to outside MIDI synths or use an on-board synthesizer\n\nWithin Metronomics, there is an option to upgrade to Metronomics Pro, which is an auto-renewing yearly subscription service.  It enables the following features:\n\n\nSubscription details:\n- Service: Metronomics Pro\n- Time period: one year, auto-renewing subscription\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase\n- Privacy policy: https://metronomicsapp.com/privacy.html / Terms of use: https://metronomicsapp.com/terms.html \n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable."

If Bootsy Collins, Roger Troutman and Daft Punk would have met up in Studio 54 to create a soft-synth, for sure something like Unique would have come out of it…” Sound & Recording Mag\n\nUnique was made for fun and vibes: Analogue sound, intense modulation and a killer set of features, delivering an amazing sonic spectrum that’s full of character: Classy sounds, powerful, warm… sometimes gritty.\n\nEach of the 2 oscillators offers a selection of 5 waveforms: sawtooth and pulse waves are here, along with noise, triple saw and triple FM waves. There's also an additional sub-oscillator strapped into the master section for added oomph.\n\nThe internal controllers will bring in the dynamics: an LFO and an envelope, there's a recordable XY field & a sequencer. Use these to modulate any knob – a simple long tap will do.\n\nThe sound springs to life when it hits the filter section. Needless to say, analogue high-pass, low-pass and band-pass varieties are in place, along with a comb filter.\n\nStandards aside, the actual intention behind this project, the Vowel Filter, also became its outstanding feature: string together two or four vowel formants and play them back in a multitude of ways.\n\nOnce you’ve built your sound, there’s tons of sound polish in two chained multi-effect units.\n\nFeatures\n\n•\tSawtooth, Triple Saw, Pulse, Triple FM, Noise with tonal Filter, Sub Sine\n•\t5 Filters with 5 Modulators each\n•\tDuophone Arpeggiator\n•\tVowel Filter\n•\tTwo Effect Sections\n•      Audio Unit v3\n•\tAbleton Link Kit\n•\tMIDI Learn & Host Automation\n•\t300 groovy presets by various artists"

      "label": "-- Harmonomics is an ear training tool for all musicians, from beginners to professionals --\n\nThe creator of the innovative metronome Metronomics has created an ear training app flexible enough to help YOUR ears, whether you are a beginner learning interval recognition or a professional who needs to recognize sequences of complex chords in inversions.\n\nFeatures:\n- 50+ exercises, from beginner to advanced\n- Each exercise is customizable with exercise-specific settings\n- Large chord library (over 35 chords, all of which come in different inversions)\n- Creative exercises -- exercises that go beyond the usual interval, melody, and chord identification\n- Detailed statistics for each exercise, plus the ability to send reports to a teacher\n- Motivating \"achievements\" for accuracy, questions per day/week/month, etc\n- and more!\n\nExercise Categories:\n- Interval\n- Melody\n- Chord\n- Chord Progression\n- Scale\n- Perfect/Relative Pitch\n\nThe details:\nHarmonomics has over 50 exercises (more coming in updates) that can each be heavily customized to fit the your individual needs, regardless of your level or the genre of music you are working on. Musicians interested in improving their recognition of chord types will be thrilled to explore Harmonomics' large library of chords (over 35 types), all of which can be played in different inversions. No other app offers such a wide variety of chords that can be played in so many different ways.\n\nStatistics play a big role in Harmonomics. Each exercise keeps track of your accuracy, the number of questions answered, average time per question, and more, letting you review your progress and see when and how quickly you're improving. Harmonomics also awards \"achievements\" as you work, such as recognition of doing 1000 questions a month or 250 questions in a session, keeping you motivated to stay vigilant about your ear training work. If you're a student, you can choose to send reports of your stats to a teacher.\n\nMost ear training apps offer a limited number of exercises, including simple interval identification, melodic dictation, and chord identification. Harmonomics has all of those as well as clever and practical variations, such as exercises that ask you which degree of a chord a certain note is or which inversion a chord is being played in. Plus, each exercise can be customized; for example, a chord identification exercise can be limited to just inverted dominant chords with alterations and made to play three chords in a  row, all of which must be identified correctly. No other app offers that level of advanced exercise to meet the needs of professionals.\n\nStart using Harmonomics today and start expanding what your ears can hear.\n\nExercise Examples:\n- Diatonic Major Melody\n- Simultaneous Intervals\n- Multiple Intervals\n- Diatonic Notes to Key Center Relationship\n- Root Movement of 7th Chords\n- Harmonic Minor Modes\n- Dominant Chords with Alterations\n- Multiple Chords / Inversions\n- Multiple Simultaneous Pitches\n\nChord Examples:\nMaj7, min7b5, 7b9#11, Maj7#5, min11, 7sus4, 7#5#9, 7b5b9, min6/9, etc"

      "label": "ZOA is a creative MIDI sequencer that is both immediate and immense.\n\nZOA uses a custom, musical implementation of John Conway’s Game of Life to generate melody, harmony, and rhythm. Up to four voices move through an evolving landscape of living cells, playing notes as they go. Each voice can move in a unique way, with its own pace and rhythmic pattern. ZOA includes unique features, such as note values based on the golden ratio for maximum generative fun.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Interact with the Game of Life by touching the grid to toggle cell states\n- Define your musical palette by configuring the grid settings\n- Create a complex dance between four independent voices\n- Free your hands to explore your synthesizers as ZOA plays them for you\n- Includes ten factory presets to give you a feel for what ZOA is capable of\n- Explore a focused, yet deep set of parameters\n    - Grid Settings\n        - Root note\n        - Octave shift\n        - Scale (see below for available scales)\n        - Octave range\n    - Game of Life Settings\n        - Grid size (8x8 and 16x16)\n        - Auto or manual generation advance\n        - Rate of new generations (in beat time from 16 bars to 32nd T)\n        - Auto or manual grid respawn\n    - Voice Settings\n        - Four voices with independent settings\n        - Enable/disable\n        - Rate of play (in beat time from 16 bars to 32nd T)\n            - Includes unique note values based on the Golden Ratio for maximum generative fun!\n        - Length of note (10% to 100%)\n        - Variety of rules for moving through grid (see below for list)\n        - Pitch offset\n        - Unique pattern control for creating rhythms and polymeters, now with step options\n            - Easily add holds, ties, accents (positive and negative!), ratchets, and trig conditions\n        - MIDI velocity and channel\n- Flexible Connectivity\n    - Use in a compatible audio unit host like AUM, or in standalone mode\n    - Control multiple instruments at once with five MIDI outputs\n        - One for all voices together, and one for each voice by itself\n    - Set the key and octave shift on the fly with MIDI input\n    - Sync to the tempo of other devices using Ableton Link or MIDI clock (standalone)\n    - Send MIDI clock to external synths (standalone, experimental feature)\n    - Connect to Bluetooth MIDI devices\n    - Modulate ZOA's parameters in a compatible AUv3 host (audio unit)\n    - Eight unique MIDI CC outputs derived from ZOA’s game of life simulation\n        - Population density, fertility, mortality, stability, and per-voice random\n    - Includes macOS app!\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\nZOA can be used as a standalone app or as an AUv3 plugin. There are some important differences between the two. The standalone app features a simple, toggleable \"Sidekick Synth\" so you can quickly experiment with ZOA. Of course, you can also send MIDI from the standalone app. Meanwhile, the ZOA AUv3 plugin does NOT generate sound. Instead, you use it to send MIDI (note messages) to other apps, plugins, or hardware instruments that do the actual sound generation. AUv3 plugins must be used inside a compatible host. \n\n\nAvailable Scales\n    - Major Pentatonic, Minor Pentatonic, Major, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Minor, Locrian, Blues, Whole Tone, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Chromatic\n\nAvailable Voice Rules\n    - Up, Down, UpDown, DownUp, First, Last, Random, Walk, Rise, Fall\n\n\nView manual: https://www.audiosymmetric.com/manuals.html\nView tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Uka-nFom-pgTB-DftgDvA"

      "label": "OODA is a fresh take on the classic MIDI step sequencer with interactive and semi-generative enhancements.\n\nWhat makes OODA unique is that you can connect arbitrary steps together using conditional “wormholes” to add structured (or random) variation to your sequences. Another unique feature is that OODA’s underlying model is decoupled from its voices. This allows you to interact with your sequences and create melodic variations in real time without affecting your groove. \n\nOODA’s open-ended sequence grid can be easily configured for almost any use case. Anything from simple melodies and bass parts to semi-generative chords and arpeggios, OODA can do it all with a little creativity!\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Record sequences up to 64 steps with the in-app keyboard or an external MIDI device\n- Interact with your sequence on the fly using four “action” buttons\n- Link together steps using conditional wormholes to create structure and variation\n- Create complex patterns of melody and rhythm using four independent voices\n- Change voice speed independent of sequencer speed\n- Comes with ten factory presets to give you an idea of what OODA is capable of\n- Explore a deep, yet focused set of parameters\n    - Sequencer Settings\n        - Grid size (4x4 or 8x8)\n        - Sync voices to sequencer rate\n        - Sequencer rate\n        - Sequencer direction\n        - Shift amount (semitones)\n        - Live toggle rests and skips\n    - Wormhole Patcher\n        - Conditionally “reroute” your sequence by connecting arbitrary steps\n        - Per-step wormholes\n        - Destination and normal steps per wormhole\n        - Trig conditions and probability for moving through each wormhole (see below for list)\n    - Voice Settings\n        - Four voices with independent settings\n        - Enable/disable\n        - Rate of play (in beat time from 16 bars to 32nd T)\n            - Includes unique note values based on the Golden Ratio for maximum generative fun!\n        - Length of note (10% to 100%)\n        - Variety of rules for selecting notes from active step (see below for list)\n        - Pitch offset\n        - Unique pattern control for creating rhythms and polymeters, now with step options\n            - Easily add holds, ties, accents (positive and negative), ratchets, and trig conditions\n        - MIDI velocity and channel\n    - Flexible Connectivity\n        - Use in a compatible audio unit host like AUM, or in standalone mode\n        - Control multiple instruments at once with five MIDI outputs\n            - One for all voices together, and one for each voice by itself\n        - Sync to the tempo of other devices using Ableton Link or MIDI clock (standalone)\n        - Send MIDI clock to external synths (standalone, experimental feature)\n        - Connect to Bluetooth MIDI devices\n        - Modulate OODA’s parameters in a compatible AUv3 host (audio unit)\n        - Eight unique MIDI CC outputs derived from OODA’s sequencer model\n            - Sequencer X, Sequencer Y, Sequence Phase, Action OR, and per-voice random\n        - Includes macOS app!\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\nOODA can be used as a standalone app or as an AUv3 plugin. There are some important differences between the two. The standalone app features a simple, toggleable \"Sidekick Synth\" so you can quickly experiment with OODA. Of course, you can also send MIDI from the standalone app. Meanwhile, the OODA AUv3 plugin does NOT generate sound. Instead, you use it to send MIDI (note messages) to other apps, plugins, or hardware instruments that do the actual sound generation. AUv3 plugins must be used inside a compatible host. \n\n\nAvailable Wormhole Rules\n    - Always, 1x through 7x, 2:2 through 8:8, 10%, 25%, 33%, 50%, 67%, 75%, 90%, Last, Not Last\n\nAvailable Voice Rules\n    - Nth, Lowest, Highest, Random, Up, Down, UpDown, DownUp, UpDown+, DownUp+, Rise, Fall\n\n\nView manual: https://www.audiosymmetric.com/manuals.html\nView tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Uka-nFom-pgTB-DftgDvA"

      "label": "TTAP for iOS is an AUv3 delay effect inspired both by adventures with analog tape and by otherworldly textural effects only possible in the digital world. Whether you’re looking for bread-and-butter delay sounds, subtle enhancements, or evolving experimental echoes, TTAP fits what you need.\n\n*** Please note: TTAP is an Audio Unit extension (AUv3) – it only works in an AUv3 host app like Garageband, AUM, Cubasis, Modstep, Beatmaker 3, etc... ***\n\nHOW IT WORKS / DESCRIPTION\n\nTTAP is a delay with two buffers. Each buffer features extensive controls for shaping the envelope of the delay sound, with another control set for glitchy pre-feedback repeats and warm pitch-bends.\nInspired by both the classic sounds of tape delays and by experiments in editing and splicing tape, TTAP features a dedicated Section control for determining the maximum length of time of the second buffer. Section also acts as a virtual LFO control, affecting a number of modulation parameters.\nBoth the Delay Time and Section controls in TTAP can either be synced to your DAW, or run free, providing up to 3.0 seconds of time for each. Try changing the speed while TTAP is running with high feedback for the expanding/contracting doppler sound familiar to any dub lover (or automate and randomize the process using the Bend control).\n\n— \n\nIn The Fade\nFade easily between two delay buffers, or jump to using one buffer exclusively with the click of a button.\n\nGlitch and Chance\nIn addition to the familiar feedback control, TTAP includes controls for randomized Repeats (synced to the Section time) for a glitchier sound. In addition, each of the buffers features a dedicated Reverse switch.\n\nIntuitive Display\nIn addition to control positions, the animations in TTAP give you essential information such as the mix between buffers, amount of feedback, time gap between buffers, and the envelope for each buffer.\n\nGo By Feel\nAs part of encouraging more musical and creative applications of WOV, in addition to using symbols for controls, the controls in WOV do not have individual readouts. We encourage you to let your ears determine the right knob positions whenever you can! If you’d like a precise readout, however, you can see/edit it by clicking on any parameter and looking in the upper-right corner of WOV.\n\nIcons\nBy default, all labels are graphical – for text labels, click the symbols/text label switch in the lower-right had corner."

      "label": "The plugin follows a graphic equalizer model, with the position of the three bands’ fader-style cut/boost controls also giving instant visual feedback of the EQ curve. But unlike a conventional graphic equalizer, BLEASS Motion EQ’s band widths are adjustable, making it easy to select the range of frequencies that will be affected by each band.\n\nNot only does BLEASS Motion EQ let you balance the tone of your audio, it can also work as a flexible filter too. Low-pass, band-pass and high pass filtering can be achieved by making use of the band mute controls. You can even create an all-pass filter effect by moving the high and low cutoff frequencies close together.\n\nThe motion part of BLEASS Motion EQ comes in the form of a pair of LFOs (Low Frequency Oscillators). These can control the frequency cutoff point of each band, as well as the amount of cut or boost that each band applies, allowing you to create swirling, ever-shifting tonal patterns. And with the LFOs Synced to your DAW, all manner of rhythmic tonal pulses and movements are possible.\n\nThe creative possibilities are taken to a new level by BLEASS Motion EQ’s ability to send each band’s signal to its own output bus (with AUM)*. This makes the plugin operate like a crossover, allowing you to route each band to its own track for further processing and mixing.\n\nMore information on https://www.bleass.com/motion-eq/"

      "label": "WOV for iOS is an AUv3 effect for making a wide range of textures out of your sounds – from familiar tremolo waves to glitchy stutters and everything in between. \n\nWOV lands on iOS with an injection of inspiring presets by Richard Devine and Stèv!\n\n*** Please note: WOV is an Audio Unit extension (AUv3) – it only works in an AUv3 host app like Garageband, AUM, Cubasis, Modstep, Beatmaker 3, etc... ***\n\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS / DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Rate Section\nThis section determines the rate or speed at which WOV operates. Rate can either be assigned in Hz, or in fractions of a beat in sync with a hosting app – to switch between Hz and sync modes, use the switches at the bottom center of WOV.\nIt’s easy to set up a static rate for WOV and leave things at that – but WOV has much more to offer! To the right of the Rate control, the bipolar Response knob sets the sensitivity with which WOV’s rate will either slow down or speed up depending on the volume of the incoming signal. The bipolar Variation control further introduces randomized amounts of variation to the rate – at its extremes going as far half the rate (knob to the far left) or twice the rate (knob to the far right).\n\nThe Depth Section\nDepth sets the amount of modulation over the dry signal – to the left and it’s more subtle, all the way to the right and WOV will act as a repeating gate. Silence introduces more randomness to the plugin, increasing the likelihood that the amplitude will be zero for some cycles.\n\nThe Waveform Section\nThe waveform of a tremolo effect is essentially its repeating envelope. Classic tremolo effects offer stock waves – WOV, being a K-Devices product, is much more customizable!\nThe Wave knob morphs between a quasi-sine shape (far left) and a slightly rounded-off square shape (far right). Peak acts as a kind of attack control for the waveform – far left for a sharp attack, or far right to reach the peak more gradually. Finally, the Warp knob allows you to either squeeze or expand the waveform, affecting the length of each sound. When the Wave control is set to a full square, Warp acts as a duty cycle/pulsewidth control.\n\nThe Accents Multislider\nThe eight-step sequencer uses a multislider to set the relative accent value for each beat of the rate. The slider adjusts between two and eight steps in length, and a button offsets the accents going to the right channel one step over from the left (note that this requires Stereo to be enabled).\n\n— \n\nGet Wide\nWOV can either preserve the stereo placement of its input signal, or it can add stereo offset to the output signal. Enabling the Stereo switch directly affects the Response, Silence, and Sequencer for a wider sound.\n\nGo By Feel\nAs part of encouraging more musical and creative applications of WOV, in addition to using symbols for controls, the controls in WOV do not have individual readouts. We encourage you to let your ears determine the right knob positions whenever you can! If you’d like a precise readout, however, you can see/edit it by clicking on any parameter and looking in the upper-right corner of WOV.\n\nIcons\nBy default, all labels are graphical – for text labels, click the symbols/text label switch in the lower-right had corner."

      "label": "LoopBud is a super simple yet very powerful MIDI recorder and looper. You can work with unlimited patterns. Although the 4-bar loops are very fun, you can work with an unlimited number of bars on each pattern!\n\nLoopBud has two record modes, Add mode and New mode. The \"add mode\" keeps adding new notes on each loop-cycle. The \"new mode\" clears out the previous recording and lets you record freshly on each cycle. You can work very fast with those modes. If you make a mistake, don't worry, you can use the \"undo\" option and get everything back!\n\nLoopBud has quantization enabled by default. You can toggle quantizing by pressing the \"quantize\" button on the top-left side. You can also set the level of quantization from the settings menu.\n\nIf you want to speed up or slow down the clock, you can do so by pressing the \"clock\" button on the top-left side. You can achieve different effects on your live performances without a new recording.\n\nYou can also focus on a single bar by pressing the bar measure on the top. You can either record or loop a single bar - which is a unique feature of LoopBud.\n\nIn the settings menu, you can edit the piano roll's lowest and highest notes. The notes on the piano roll is not editable. However, you can export MIDI from the settings menu, and do editing on your favorite piano roll editor app!\n\nLoopBud is not an audio app, it's a MIDI app. You need to connect a MIDI input and a MIDI output for LoopBud to work. You can do so from the settings menu in the standalone app. You can use the MIDI matrix editor on your DAW if you are using the AUv3 plugin. LoopBud also supports Ableton Link on the standalone app."

Emphasize your basslines working with waveshaper’s sections blend and color, or increasing the clip’s value (this works great also on drums and acoustic percussive sounds). Blow digital coldness to your synths going wild with S&M and Bits&Samps functions, or increasing wrap or fold values . Add unpredictable dynamic glitches thanks the exclusive gate. Shaper is your digital edge!\n\nShaper 2 is composed by several modules, that you can rearrange as you want:\n- a glitch gate, now with a Smooth parameter\n- a waveshaper with 5 inspiring functions: Muffin, Multistress, Cracker, S&M, Bits&Samps\n- a transform module with Clip, Wrap, Fold, and sFold functions\n- a resonator/short delay, that can act as a comb filter too\n- a lopass/hipass filter lets adjust the processed sound\n\nMODULAR STRUCTURE\nDrag and reorder modules as you prefer and create different chains for different needs.\n\nGRAPHICS\nBeyond classic oscilloscope, two displays show the exact function you are using to process incoming sounds.\n\nI/O\nYou choose how to feed Shaper 2 and how to mix it with Gain and Mix parameters.\n\nGO BY FEEL / PRECISE EDITING\nAs part of encouraging more musical and creative applications of Shaper 2, in addition to using symbols for controls, the controls in Shaper 2 do not have individual readouts. We encourage you to let your ears determine the right knob positions whenever you can! If you’d like a precise readout, however, you can see/edit it by clicking on any parameter and looking in the upper-right corner of Shaper 2.\n\nICONS / TEXT LABELS\nBy default, all labels are graphical – for text labels, click the symbols/text label switch in the lower-right corner."

Our model gives you access to a 100% continuous response, a very small sized library (90Mb), common FX and adjustable bell and release volumes. It also ensures that the staccatos and releases that make up for half of the realism sound perfect, not like a fadeout, not too loud, just perfect.\n\nThe second concentric knobs control Treble and Bass, just like on a real suitcase Rhodes. We measured this carefully and made sure the ranges and frequencies matched the original.\nThe vibrato has two controls, the depth and the speed. We carefully measured the output of the preamp and copied the real output of each channel. We also added a tempo link as it can be very useful. We also extended the original range as this is a common mod on real Rhodes.\nWe measured the output of the preamp of a Rhodes© suitcase and created an exact replica of the stereo panning of the Vibrato. We just added the possibility to sync it to your tempo and also extended the speed range just like some real mods do.\nThere are two very common FX accessible on the front panel: reverb and drive. You can also engage the AMP simulation from the front panel.\n\nThe VTines combines samples and modeling techniques to accurately reproduce the sound of the original instrument. This allows the VTines to weight only 90Mb, to really sound like a Fender Rhodes with all of its imperfections and to have a fully continuous response.\n\nThe « Live » version of our instruments has been especially thought for Live performance usage. CPU and RAM footprints have been optimized, so that our model can run on IOS devices. We paid a particular attention to making it easy to connect and use with external MIDI keyboards, and/or within you favorite AUv3 host\n\n- Sampling and modeling hybrid of a Mark1 Fender Rhodes©\n- Full continuous velocity\n- Perfect staccatos and release samples\n- 7 high quality presets\n- Bass and treble EQ adjusted to the frequencies and ranges of the original preamp\n- Precise modeling of the original Vibrato effect (can be synched to the host tempo)\n- Very detailed Rhodes© AMP simulation\n- Reverberation and Drive FX\n- Adjustable pedal volume, release volume and bell amount\n- Adjustable MIDI response, input sources and channels\n- Adjustable MIDI CCs to control knobs and switches\n- Standalone app and AUv3 plug-in\n- Low download and installation size (less than 90 Mb)\n- Reasonably low RAM and CPU footprint"

      "label": "DigiStix 2 is an AUv3 compatible drum machine and sampler plugin for your favourite DAW.\n\nThis new version of DigiStix brings some distinct advantages over its predecessor, most notably the ability to host up to 64 samples per drumkit with 5 layers per pad. The interface has been drastically redesigned for iPad to make better use of full screen mode, allowing a popular MPC style 4x4 pad layout with 4 banks of samples. Digistix 2 also allows greater control over the multi-sample layers, with the ability to individually control the volume levels and pitch of layers as well as global pitch and tune settings all from the new sample window.\n\nPreviously, each pad had effect sends for the internal reverb and delay effects, but this can now be routed to external busses 9 and 10 for processing using external effects. \n\nThe controller editing is now build into the main display and can be edited in place without the need to scroll the interface. It also now supports extra effect controllers. A new context aware control window allows you to quickly change pad settings without the need for popup windows. \n\nDigiStix 2 now supports GM and original DS drum kit layouts, and includes a sophisticated multi-layer Auto Sampler, capable of recording new GM compatible drumkits automatically from your hardware. It is 100% backward compatible with the original app, and can be used as a drop-in replacement.\n\nDrag and drop support now allows you to directly drop samples on specific layers, as well as preview and edit them directly. You can create new kits by simply combining banks from existing kits into one mega kit, or use our non destructive referencing to include sounds from other kits.\n\nThe randomize feature has been enhanced so you can randomize individual instruments or within specific banks. The new continuous MIDI learn mode makes custom mapping a breeze.\n\nPatterns can also be exported as MIDI stems for use in other packages including a direct import to Helium clips. You can also export patterns as audio in the latest version.\n\nThe auto sample feature allows automated recording of GM compatible kits directly from hardware drum machines. The slice editor can also be used for MPC style slicing of audio clips.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• 64 Assignable Pads (4 banks of 16 pads).\n• Advanced Randomize Pattern feature.\n• Internal & external effect routing.\n• Mix and match different kits with drum references.\n• Up to 64 beats per pattern.\n• Songs up to 255 patterns in length.\n• Reverse Mode, Triplets and Accents.\n• Supports Mute Groups.\n• Multi-layer and Round Robin modes.\n• DS and GM MIDI Mapping.\n• 64 channel Mixer.\n• 8 band EQ.\n• Randomize Feature.\n• Sophisticated Auto Sampler\n• Export loops to audio and MIDI formats.\n• Looping Mode with Time Stretching.\n• Build in Delay, Reverb, Overdrive, Bit Crunch and LP/HP Filters.\n• Paramter Automation from your DAW.\n• Local and Remove MIDI Sync.\n• Built in Sampler.\n• Multi-bus/outputs when using AUM\n• Multiple Import options.\n• Melodic Remapping.\n• MIDI Mapping.\n• Real time and Step pattern recording. \n• iTunes and Filer importing of samples.\n• Files App Drag & Drop Support\n• Sample Slicer"

      "label": "Have you ever struggled to find confidence on stage or inspiration in the studio? AeroPads cues immersive pads and soundscapes that inspire and equip you to perform your very best every time.\n\nENHANCE YOUR SOUND. ENGAGE YOUR AUDIENCE.\nEvery musician has experienced an empty mix or an awkward transition. When using AeroPads, you instantly add more dimension and character to your sound. With a more immersive mix and the ability to perform smooth and seamless transitions, you will feel more confident while your audience will be more engaged.\n\nFOR EVERY MUSICIAN.\nPads and soundscapes are a versatile accompaniment to nearly any style of music. Whether you are a soloist or full band, AeroPads will take your sound to the next level. Rock bands, worship teams, wedding singers, producers, songwriters, and instrumentalists are just a few of the many types of musicians that have loved using AeroPads.\n\nDESIGNED FOR THE STAGE. INSPIRED BY SPACE.\nAeroPads features creative and immersive soundscapes paired with a beautiful and intuitive interface, all inspired by the pinnacle of exploration and inspiration: outer space.\n\nCREATIVITY THAT SPARKS CREATIVITY.\nAeroPads aren't your typical pads. Most pads out there are really boring or insanely obnoxious. However, AeroPads features thoughtfully crafted soundscapes that are meticulously fine-tuned with the perfect amount of harmonic and textural movement. Simply put, AeroPads won't step on the toes of your arrangement or get on the nerves of your sound guy (like most other pads out there).\n\n\nHighlighted Features:\n- A beautiful space-inspired interface with a simple and intuitive design.\n- Live View: Every key and three of your favorite patches are instantly accessible (best suited for experimentation, free-flowing sets, and songwriting).\n- Setlist View: Plan and build a detailed setlist (best suited for structured sets and seamless transitions).\n- The iconic Atmosphere Soundpack which includes five unique patches named after and inspired by the layers of Earth's atmosphere. \n- Three patches can be added to Live View to be made instantly accessible, so there's no need to dig through menus to just to change a patch when performing live.\n- Additional patches and soundpacks available for purchase.\n\n\nHow to Use:\n01. Cue a pad that matches the key of your musical arrangement.\n02. Play overtop of the accompanying pads and soundcapes.\n03. Enjoy the boost of audience engagement, musician confidence, and creative inspiration.\n\nPads and soundscapes are intended as a subtle accompaniment to musical arrangements/performances. They are designed to be cued according to the key of the arrangement. Once cued, you'll hear a droning pad centered around the root note with additional harmonic textures within the major scale. Pads can accompany arrangements of both minor and major scales. To accompany an arrangement within a minor scale, cue the relative major (Example: to accompany an arrangement in the key of A minor, cue \"C\"). A pad's key should not be changed to match chord changes within an arrangement. The only time a pad's key should change within a song is in the instance of a key change. For best results, mix AeroPads appropriately within the overall mix. When mixed too loud, AeroPads may compete with melodies and the arrangement. When mixed too quietly, AeroPads may be less effective. When mixed appropriately, they will sound awesome."

      "label": "Introducing a revolutionary new way to turn your guitar or bass into a fully featured polyphonic synth: Roxsyn, the world’s first metamorphic guitar synthesizer. Expressive, fast and responsive to every nuance, it is a league apart from all other guitar synths to date.\n\nUnhappy with cold and temperamental guitar-to-MIDI synths that dominate the market, we developed a completely new approach to guitar synthesis. Our all-original technology synthesizes your guitar directly, without the use of MIDI notes. Rescued from being a poor keyboard substitute, your guitar suddenly becomes an integral part of the synth. It's alive!\n\nThere is no pitch tracking involved. There are no pitch estimation errors, octave glitches, or garbled chords. There is no over-complicated G2M between your guitar and synth to destroy everything human about your playing. Instead, Roxsyn’s metamorphic sound generation technology retains all the personality of your sound: vibrato, slides, bends, dynamics, even extended technique. The result is a polyphonic synthesizer that is as fast and accurate as it is richly expressive.\n\nNo need for special MIDI pickups or hardware, either: just plug into your favorite Lightning/USB audio interface, and start synthing!\n\n::Powerful Synth Engine::\n\nRoxsyn’s big synth heart is its three metamorphic signal generators (AKA oscillators). Each generator offers 5 unique waveforms, and has a 4+ octave range to cover a wide spectrum of frequencies. They also feature stereo panning, and can route into either of Roxsyn’s dual filter banks. You can even dial in your guitar directly into the synth engine for even bigger sounds.\n\n::Dual Filter Banks::\n\nEach containing four custom virtual-analog filter types and dedicated envelopes, the filter banks help sculpt the synth generators in countless new ways. The envelopes are specially designed for the guitar, and are driven by a fully adjustable automatic trigger generator controlled by your playing dynamics. Envelopes offer original features like finite-duration sustain stages, as well as the ability to receive or ignore trigger-off messages. They can also be triggered externally via MIDI controllers like an expression pedal.\n\nAn additonal envelope controls the amplitude of the signal, giving you even more options in creating synth sounds.\n\n::Arpeggiator::\n\nInstantly transform sustained guitar notes into fast (or slow), complex patterns with Roxsyn’s powerful yet easy to use arp. There are 8 stepping algorithms to choose from, as well as settable note value, swing, and note repeats. You can even route the arp to any combination of the 3 voice generators — enabling you to layer a non-arpeggiated sound with an arp pattern. What's more, the arp can send trigger signals into any of Roxsyn’s 4 envelopes, and even reset the LFOs. So it’s also a handy rhythmic / trance tool as well!\n\n::Modulation & FX::\n\nRoxsyn’s user friendly modulation matrix lets you manipulate parameters (pitch, amplitude, filters, etc) using its two LFOs and mod envelope. Add subtle vibrato, even glide simulation, or go full-on berserk. LFOs each have 9 waveforms, and feature beat syncing. Each matrix row can take LFOs or the mod envelope as a modulator or control, and can even use external control sources.\n\nAnd if you like your synths on the spicy side, Roxsyn comes with top-notch stereo FX specially developed to evoke extra synthiness: Powerful algorithmic reverb with the sound of countless rooms, phasing, modulating, 2-channel delay, and graphic EQ.\n\n::Pro Features::\n\n500+ factory presets with bass, lead, pad, arp sounds & more. Easily create & share your own presets. Audio Unit v3,  IAA, Audiobus, Ableton Link. 64-bit processing at up to 96kHz. 160+ MIDI controllable parameters; MIDI learn & map save/share. Tapedeck (in the app), so you can record, loop & share your ideas on the go. Just some of Roxsyn’s professional features that make life and music a little bit easier."

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added.

Use the StereoEQ setting for that)\n+ Select from over 10 presets or save your own. You can even share them via email and import presets from other people via email.\n+ Full background support including remote control (from docks, headsets, car stereos)\n+ Visualize the music with the spectrum analyzer.\n+ Use AirPlay to listen on your AppleTV, or your Bluetooth headsets and even a dock. \n+ Use the pre-amp slider to adjust the overall boost or cut. Make sure to turn the slider down if you experience distortion. Use the auto-normalizer function to prevent clipping automatically and have the best dynamic range possible with your eq curve. (on/off in settings)\n+ Curve screen: curve redraws as controllers are dragged. Pinch to modify Q. Three stage clipping signal on preamp slider. Keyboard entry for pre-amp. Twitter/Facebook/Weibo integration to share your current EQ curve. Bypass.\n+ Crossfade between songs. Make sure to stop the music before changing the crossfade time slider.\n+ Now playing screen includes repeat (all, single no repeat) button and shuffles like the music app. Improved stability of on the fly modifications of the playlist. Add more songs to the playlist at any time.

You need to convert DRM songs. Apple Music Streaming uses copy-protected songs.\n\niCLOUD:\nOnly the Apple Music app can manage songs in iCloud (iTunes Match). You will need to make sure the songs are downloaded to your device to listen and enhance them via Equalizer. If you want to stream and eq your music, you can try our other app: CloudEQ. It allows you to stream and eq music from SoundCloud and your Dropbox account without the need for storage on your device.\n\nFrom the reviews:\n\nEXCELLENT PROGRAM\nI connect my iphone 4 to a car audio system, with the application the music began to sound incomparably better ....\nA little clear interface, but to understand it and understand need no more than 5-10 minutes. -- P_S_B_\n***\nLOVE IT\nThis is the EQ I have been looking for, and because of bad ratings I almost passed on it! I consider myself an aspiring audiophile and have the equipment -- Klipsch, Sunfire, Nottingham, Denon, Paradigim, etc. -- (and debt) to back it up. This EQ performs flawlessly and is very easy to use. It enhanced my music dramatically. Yes, dramatically! Just make sure you are running the recommended IOS, as the developer suggests. -- J. Paul DiMaggio\n***\n\n\nPLEASE if you have concerns or encounter problems with the app: post on http://www.audioforge.ca and we will explain how things work, until you can use all the features of the app to the fullest. Thank you"

Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools."

      "label": "iVCS3\nOfficial EMS VCS3 emulator\n\nThe VCS3 was created in 1969 by Peter Zinovieff's EMS company. The electronics were largely designed by David Cockerell and the machine's distinctive visual appearance was the work of electronic composer Tristram Cary. The VCS3 was more or less the first portable commercially available synthesizer—portable in the sense that the VCS 3 was housed entirely in a small, wooden case.\nThe VCS3 was quite popular among progressive rock bands and was used on recordings by The Alan Parsons Project, Jean Michel Jarre, Hawkwind, Brian Eno (with Roxy Music), King Crimson, The Who, Gong, and Pink Floyd, among many others. Well-known examples of its use are on The Who track \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" (as an external sound processor, in this case with Pete Townshend running the signal of a Lowrey Organ through the VCS3's filter and low frequency oscillators) on Who's Next. Pink Floyd's \"On the Run\" (from The Dark Side of the Moon) made use of its oscillators, filter and noise generator, as well as the sequencer. Their song Welcome to the Machine also used the VCS3. The bassy throb at the beginning of the recording formed the foundation of the song, with the other parts being recorded in response. The VCS3 was also a staple at the BBC’s Radiophonic Workshop, and was a regular (and most frightening) sound generator for the Dr Who TV series. Many fo the monsters and atmoshere;s created for the show came directly from the VCS3. \n\nDescription\n\nThe VCS3 has three oscillators (in reality, the first 2 oscillators are normal oscillators and the 3rd an LFO or Low Frequency Oscillator), a noise generator, two input amplifiers, a ring modulator, a 18dB/octave (pre-1974) or 24dB/octave (after 1974) voltage controlled low pass filter (VCF), a trapezoid envelope generator, joy-stick controller, voltage controlled spring reverb unit and 2 stereo output amplifiers. Unlike most modular synthesizer systems which use cables to link components together, the VCS3 uses a distinctive patch board matrix into which pins are inserted in order to connect its components together.\nKeyboards controller\n\nDK1 keyboard controller\n\nAlthough the VCS3 is often used for generating sound effects due to lack of built-in keyboard, there were external keyboard controllers for melodic play. The DK1 in 1969 was an early velocity sensitive monophonic keyboard for VCS3 with an extra VCO and VCA. Later it was extended for duophonic play, as DK2, in 1972. Also in 1972, Synthi AKS was released, and its digital sequencer with a touch-sensitive flat keyboard, KS sequencer, and its mechanical keyboard version, DKS, were also released.\n\n(See: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCS3)"

      "label": "An iOS port of Snapcast: https://github.com/badaix/snapcast\nThis app requires a Snapserver to be installed and running in your local network.\n\nIt supports both playback and control of other clients.\n\nSnapcast is a multiroom client-server audio player, where all clients are time synchronized with the server to play perfectly synced audio. It's not a standalone player, but an extension that turns your existing audio player into a Sonos-like multiroom solution.\nAudio is captured by the server and routed to the connected clients. Several players can feed audio to the server in parallel and clients can be grouped to play the same audio stream.\nOne of the most generic ways to use Snapcast is in conjunction with the music player daemon (MPD) or Mopidy."

Create a new Alarm.\n2. Choose either one song or create a playlist of songs to shuffle.\n3. Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

      "label": "With SonoSequencr you can create individual sequences to perform recurring tasks with just one click.\n\nIf you have multiple Sonos devices and want to play a radio station on all of them, it takes some time to set this up. With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

Tuner T1 Pro also comes with a handy Tone Generator that plays any musical note as reference for tuning. A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Live pitch graph displays the exact pitch, note and deviation in realtime.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to visualize pitch on piano keys.\r\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

      "label": "iDrumTune Pro is the world’s most advanced, accurate and intelligent system for assisting and educating on drum tuning – used by thousands of drummers all over the world. Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "The latest title in the KORG DS-10 series, now available for the iOS!\n\nThe KORG DS-10 series was an enormous hit for the Nintendo DS. Now, seven years later, it has undergone a further evolution while staying true to its original spirit. Now available is the KORG iDS-10, a portable synthesizer studio for iOS. \n\nThe KORG iDS-10 combines a cutting-edge analog synthesizer, voice synthesizer, and analog drum machine inspired by motifs from the original KORG DS-10. This iOS app gives you a hand-held system to easily create electronic music, which requires persuasive sound with a minimal number of notes.\n\n*** Powerful analog synthesizer lets you visually learn sound design ***\nThe analog synthesizer provides carefully selected parameters, making it easy to enjoy sound design. The unique patching function also lets you create sound in even deeper ways. Since all parameters can be automated, you have a wide range of song-production possibilities. Each synthesizer provides five types of effect with an oscilloscope that helps you see the sound. This cutting-edge synth engine takes full advantage of the iOS device’s CPU to generate astonishing sound, and will heighten your enjoyment using the KORG DS-10.\n\n*** Enter your lyrics, and the voice synthesizer turns them into a voice ***\nThe voice synthesizer is one of the popular features of the KORG iDS-10. Based on a vocoder, its engine makes it easy to generate voices. It also supports input via a microphone which can be used as a conventional vocoder. The parameters are optimized for creating such voices, so you’ll be able to enjoy sound design with a different character than an analog synthesizer, further widening the possibilities for your music.\n\n*** Analog drum synthesizer makes it easy to produce the sounds that you want ***\nDrums are now more important than ever, and the iDS-10 provides an analog drum machine that’s carefully tuned for easy creation of powerful sounds. With total control over six drum sounds (kick, snare, hihat1 / ihat2, tom, and percussion), you can create awesome tracks with high impact.\n\n*** Smart keyboard and KAOSS mode make step-recording enjoyable ***\nThe smart keyboard lets you specify a scale so that you can step-record without worrying about “wrong” notes. And of course there’s also KAOSS mode, where you can produce a limitless range of great-sounding phrases, with just a touch of the keyboard. The scale setting is also applied to the sequencer’s note display, so you can enjoy producing songs whether or not you have any musical knowledge or experience.\n\n*** Pattern play that you can perform in real time ***\nThe pattern play capability of the KORG DS10 has further evolved, generating amazing user performances. You can seamlessly play 32 patterns, and also manipulate track mute and solo settings in real time. It’s guaranteed to result in the kind of protean acts that are notable in modern day DJ performances.\n\n*** Send your songs by email for collaborative music productions ***\nThere’s a function that allows the transfer of song data via email, making it easy to exchange songs with your friends.\n\n*** Mystery bingo!? ***\nAnd then there’s the enigmatic mystery bingo; as you continue enjoying the KORG iDS-10, the full picture will become clearer …\n\nThis app was produced in cooperation with the game music and app production company “Detune.” Don’t miss this opportunity to experience the world of the KORG iDS-10 that resulted from this collaboration with Detune Inc.\n\nThe first title in the KORG DS-10 series was the KORG DS-10 which was announced in 2008. The second title was the KORG DS-10 PLUS which launched in 2009.\nThese are products of Marvelous Inc.

      "label": "During a routine mining expedition in the outer regions of the galaxy five mysterious boxes of unknown origin were found. Rumours among the workers spread quickly that there was a strange feeling being around these boxes, as if time flows in a different way, not just forward but sometimes also folding back on itself. The miners nicknamed them, the five boxes of reverberation. After the excavation process, to study them more closely, it was decided to transport them back to earth. \n\nRymdigare is part reverb, part noise and drone machine, part quality degrader and part wave shaper. The reverb is built from 5 reverberation boxes where you can control the sound with length and ratio parameters, tail and weight skew parameters and an internal feedback parameter, that could be used to create swelling tails. There is also a built in octave shifter, resonant filter, speed and level degrader and 4 LFO sources for modulating a selected set of parameters, including the LFO speeds themselves. The app can run stand-alone, connecting to other apps through Inter App Audio or AudioBus or it can run as an AUv3 plugin. Map and control any parameter with MIDI using Core MIDI, Bluetooth MIDI, Inter App Audio MIDI or AUv3 MIDI.\n\n+ Resonant filter (low, band or high pass)\n+ Noise and drone machine\n+ Level and speed degrader\n+ Wave shaper (input and output gain)\n+ Reverb (length, ratio, skew, tail, feedback and type: free, bpm, tuned)\n+ Reverb random variation controls\n+ Octave shifter up and down\n+ Planet orbits (LFO: double tap on parameter controls to map)\n+ Inter App Audio, AudioBus and AUv3\n+ Map Midi CC using Core MIDI, Bluetooth MIDI, IAA Midi or AUv3 MIDI."

      "label": "Unfiltered Audio's Tails is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nUnfiltered Audio joined forces with electronic music superstar BT to create Tails, the world's most harmonic reverb.\n\nTails utilizes a novel double-buffered technology to create two separate reverbs in parallel. The twist comes with special threshold swapping: Whenever Tails detects a major change in amplitude or tone, it can smoothly swap between the two reverbs. Additionally, Tails can auto-duck on its inputs and outputs.\n\nThis keeps your reverb as clean as possible. With auto-ducking on attacks, you can keep the metallic noise of percussive hits out of your reverbs. Alternatively, you can keep passing tones and blue notes out of your melodic echoes so that your reverb is free of dissonance.\n\nEven without its innovative ducking and swapping, Tails is the most flexible reverb in your arsenal. Two of Unfiltered Audio's classic BYOME reverb algorithms (Renoun and Deep) are available with a Spatial mode inspired by Silo and a brand new Shimmer mode designed to BT's exacting specifications. In true Unfiltered Audio fashion, a global Sample Rate knob affects the sampling rate of the entire DSP algorithm, stretching your reverb tails out into crispy, lo-fi oblivion.\n\nFinally, Tails is built to be performed. Your MIDI keyboard's Pitch and Mod wheels can be assigned quickly to a selection of key parameters, while Note messages can be used to manually duck or mute the reverb.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Tails has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Tails can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with Tails will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

      "label": "Steel Guitar PRO is a highly advanced guitar processor that combines cutting-edge realtime audio generation with a truly expressive control interface. It provides many unique guitar models, built-in amps & FX processing, MIDI control, AUv3, and wide-ranging customizability.\n\n:: Control Surface ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO features a powerful yet familiar control interface. Simply touch the strings to “pick,” and drag the slide bar to modulate pitch. By enabling enhanced slide control, you can even use multiple touches to tilt the slide bar, or dampen the strings. Fretboard dimension, string spacing, and pick guard size are all configurable. A high level of resolution enables minute pitch control and realistic vibrato. Settings let you vary guitar tone, sustain and release times, touch behavior, slide bar auxiliary control, handedness, and more.\n\n:: Guitars ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO provides you with an arsenal of guitars to choose from: unique examples of humbuckers, single coils, P90s, and more. Instruments include many 6 string guitars, as well as 8- and 10-string steel guitar variants. Each family of instruments comes with many tuning to choose from, but you can also create and save your own. In addition, you have up to seven virtual “pedals” to bend individual or collections of string — much like a pedal steel. The pedals can be actuated by slightly tilting the device, or via MIDI, or even with the fretting touch. All of this is configurable by the user.\n\n:: Built-In FX Processing ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO incorporates a virtual signal chain where you can put amps and FX in any combination. The included dozen amps and 20 FX are all custom tuned to evoke the best tones from the guitar processor. Each amp or effect features multiple parameters to precisely modify its tone and feel. These parameters are MIDI-mappable, so that you can control them via an external device. The amp collection covers a broad spectrum from bell-like cleans to thick overdrive. The FX include many analog inspired “pedals” that range from overdrives, distortions, mods, delays, reverbs, to beyond.\n\n:: AUv3 & MIDI ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO can also be used as an AUv3 MIDI plugin. We developed a custom MIDI sub-protocol so that Steel Guitar PRO and its powerful control interface can run seamlessly inside an AUv3 host. You can also use a traditional MIDI keyboard or device to play Steel Guitar PRO, which readily accommodates MIDI pitch & mod wheels, and key velocity as well. \n\n:: Useful Features ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO includes a comprehensive preset management system that allows you to save, modify, and share any number of your “rigs.” The standalone app also includes a handy “tape deck” where you can record, play, loop and import/export audio. MIDI learn feature is easy and intuitive to use, but also offers deeper customization. All audio processing is done in the highest resolution, natively and without resampling at rates up to 96kHz. The fluid user interface integrates readily with many different AUv3 hosts."

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store. If you have questions and/or suggestions, feel free to contact me via e-mail or facebook."

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

      "label": "XAir Monitor Mixer is a personal monitor mixer for select Behringer and Midas digital mixers. It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

[build in subtitle is also supported]\n\n* Extra Features\n\n- USB Sync: Use itunes to fast sync movies to GPlayer.\n- WIFI Upload: Upload movie even you don't have the cable.\n- File Management: Support New/Rename/Cut/Paste/Delete.\n- Movie Thumbnail: Easy to find the movie you want to view.\n- Different Play Mode: Support Loop off/Loop One/Loop all.\n- Screen Lock: View your movie even on the bed.\n- Dynamically Menu: Dynamically choose audio/subtitle channel and encoding method.\n- Gesture support: Easier way to do seek while playing the movie.\n- Resume Function: Don't worry about closing your application suddenly.\n- TV Out: Both cable TV out and AirPlay are supported.\n- iTunes Backup: By default, we will not backup media data when you do iTunes sync or iCloud backup, and you can't see the files in iTunes, you can enable it in the settings page to backup your media data.\n\n* FAQ\n\n- How do I put files into GPlayer? \nTo add files to your GPlayer app, you have to go to iTunes, and select the “Apps” tab. At the bottom of this page, there’s a “File sharing” section – just select GPlayer in the list, and add files from there. Note that you don’t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the “File sharing” tab, and they’ll be uploaded immediately. You can even use a friend’s iTunes to add videos to your own iPhone. Also, adding files over WiFi is supported. Indeed, WiFi is significantly slower than USB, and ruins the battery life.\n\n- What kind of streams does GPlayer play? \nGPlayer is able to play RTSP and MMS streams. For now those can’t be added to the media library, but you can click an RTSP or MMS url in Safari or Mail for example.\nIf you want to use GPlayer to open HTTP/FTP streaming, add \"gplayer:\" prefix in the URL.\n\n- I want to explicitely open an attachment with GPlayer? \nIf you want to watch an attachment in GPlayer(from Mail for example), just do a long press on the attachment. A menu will pop-up that will let you pick GPlayer as a player.\n\n- iTunes won’t let me install GPlayer on my iPhone or iPod Touch? \nUnfortunately, we had to drop support for older iOS devices such as the iPhone 3G or the first two versions of iPods. Indeed, after some testing, we realized those weren’t fast enough to provide a pleasant experience.\n\n- Why HD MKV movies don’t play smoothly? \nCurrently, only iPad 2 supports 720p MKV file, that’s to be expected. The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n- The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable \"Skip Frame\" in the settings page.\n\n- Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, supports iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.\n\n* Contact us\n\nMail: gplayersupport@hotmail.com\nWebsite: gplayersupport.wordpress.com\n\n* If you want to help to translate GPlayer to your mother language, just drop a mail to gplayersupport@hotmail.com, that will help people in your country enjoy this software, and we will put your name in thanks page!"

It offers pipe organ realism that you will really enjoy!\nIt is suitable for any music, religious or profane. Obviously, due to the size of the instrument, musical pieces needs some adaptations to be played. But still, you'll get pleasure to play our digital organ pipe. We are currently working on improving the use of the keyboards and octaves.\n\nOur church organ is composed of two independent keyboards or 4 octaves. On every keyboard, you can assign one or 2 voices, among a choice of 6 voices. You control them with the two sets of 6 stop knobs above the piano keyboard. It  can do automatic transposition. You can play in any key with the same keyboard position. You just need to select the note to play on the C key of the keyboard.\n\nThe sound is processed from high quality uncompressed sound samples, for bringing you the best musical experience. We selected the voices among the most common and famous sounds. \n\nUpper keyboard may play one or two voices from:\n- Big church organ, with big, warm and full sound (subwoofer offers good results for the lowest octave)\n- Warm organ, with simpler sound, very interesting\n- Synthesizer, crystal and warm sound\n- Piccolo flute, which brings the light flute sound\n- Recorder\n- Clarinet, with the typical vibrating reed sound\n\nLower keyboard may play one or two voices from :\n- Big church organ\n- Warm organ\n- Synthesizer\n- Trombone, a large and low pitched brass instrument\n- Tuba, very close to Trombone. Playing them is pair is interesting.\n- Recorder\n\nDepending on the instrument, we advise you to select the proper octave on the keyboard for the best sound. For example, the recorder sound is interesting from octave 2 to 4 (not so much in first octave).\n\nYou can play up to 5 notes at a time, from any keyboard. You should not push the volume at the maximum within Church Organ preferences, otherwise some clicks may appear in the sound. We included a feature to auto adapt the sound level according to the music played to always have the maximum volume without clicks.\n\nAn option is available for sustaining the notes after releasing the keyboard keys. Three choices are available: no sustain, sort sustain and long sustain. This option increases the realism of the church organ!\n\nYou may use the following tunings :\n- Modern tempered scale,\n- Pythagorician scale (pre XVI century),\n- Meantone scale (1600),\n- Werckmeister III scale (1691),\n- Bach/Lehman scale (1722)\n- Hindustani harmonic scale (suits also Carnatic music)\n\nFor getting the best sound from this instrument, it is advised to use a good headphone or a pair of speakers with subwoofer."

The playful touch UI invites anything from live performance, experimentation to learning and mastering the granular concept.\n\nMultiple plugins: Import, Record or Live Process\nYou can import your own WAVs (standalone & AUv3 Instrument plugin), Record audio (Record effect plugin) or live-process sound (Process effect plugin) to create anything from drones and granular echoes to moving microtonal audio textures.\n\nDesigned for touch: Kinetic Sliders\nAll sliders and XY pads are linked to a physics model which lets you flick and throw them around. Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

      "label": "Co-designed with Berlin-based electronic musician Hainbach, Gauss brings the oldschool tape-looping art form to mobile devices. This creative field looper works both standalone and as an Audio Unit effect plugin and puts the possibilities of using looped tapes in your hands. Without the need for scissors.\n\nLike real tape loops Gauss takes you off the grid of your DAW: you can adjust tape speed and direction, even during recording. The flow of your loops will drift organically as the tape follows its own cyclical timeline. \n\nUse overdub, or even multiple instances of the Audio Unit plugin, to create multi-layered ever changing sonic palettes. \n\nWe want this app to be a celebration of digital audio technology, so when audio quality is degraded it will do so in a pleasingly crunchy digital way. For example, recording on low tape speeds will give you longer recording time, but at the cost (or pleasure) of a distinctively lower recording quality. So Gauss mimics the behaviour - not the sound - of magnetic tape.\n\nSet the length of the tape, record and overdub your audio, play around with tape speeds; Gauss captures the essence of two ends of tape stuck together in all its unsynchronised, free-running glory. There's even a unique built-in 4-step polyrhythmic sequencer for sequencing tape-speed changes.\n\n- designed as a standalone field recorder and an Audio Unit effect plugin (AUv3) in one package\n- universal app: plugin and standalone work on all iDevices, iOS11 and higher\n- variable tape speed; seamlessly change direction and speed during playback or recording\n- 4-step sequencer lets you trigger (polyrhythmic) tape-speed changes in sync with your host tempo\n- variable inertia for the tape drive motors (from instant to very slow speed changes) \n- built-in multi-mode filter with LFO modulation\n- delay effect with optional host-sync mode\n- “1989” mode uses a special 8 bit/11KHz tape head for a last-century vintage digital sound\n- 45 seconds maximum loop size at 1x speed, proportionally longer at lower speeds (.e.g 90 seconds at half speed, etc.)\n- overdub at any speed or tape direction\n- plugin supports global cross-host preset handling (requires iOS13+, compatible AUv3 host)\n\nFind the user manual at ruismaker.com"

There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

Then switch on and off individual steps to create a drum pattern.\n\nWhether used as a practice tool or composition sketchpad, its intuitive interface allows you to easily make drum patterns that use odd meters, symmetrical and asymmetrical rhythmic structures, and various subdivisions of the pulse. \n\nWith Additive Drum Machine your musical imagination is the limit."

      "label": "The Minimoog Model D App is a software transmutation of the world’s first portable synthesizer, the Minimoog Model D®. Anyone can jump in and play with over 160 included presets or lay fingers to the controls and begin exploring vast magical realms of creative potential for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and Mac. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App incorporates a number of inspiring sound creation tools and capabilities not present on its analog antecedent. New functions include the ability to play chords with up to four-note polyphony, an easy-to-use arpeggiator for rhythmic pattern creation, a real time looping recorder with unlimited overdubbing capacity, a tempo-synchronizable stereo ping pong delay module, and the Bender -- a wide-range stereo time modulation effect module. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App also supports AUv3 Audio Unit extensions, which allows multiple instances of this powerful instrument to be used simultaneously within compatible iOS apps supporting AUv3.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY \nIntroduced by Moog in 1970, the Minimoog Model D served as the archetype for all electronic keyboards that followed. It gave users the ability to design their own sounds, translating imagination into reality. The Minimoog’s portability, affordability and accessibility made it the go-to instrument for musicians looking to expand beyond the traditional sounds of the time. Bernie Worrell used the Minimoog Model D to establish Parliament Funkadelic’s futuristic funk sound. Kraftwerk employed the Minimoog Model D on the successful concept album Autobahn, sparking an entirely new genre. Gary Numan replaced his live band’s guitars with Minimoog Model Ds, creating the prototype for industrial music. The classic sound of the Minimoog Model D can be heard on Bob Marley’s Catch A Fire, Michael Jackson’s Thriller and Dr. Dre’s The Chronic; Detailed in the mini-doc series “A Brief History Of The Minimoog”. \n\nFEATURES \n• Ships with over 160 presets (hundreds more available in the Minimoog Model D App Store) \n• Up to 4-notes of polyphony \n• Easily share presets and audio recordings with friends \n• Arpeggiator module with note-hold and chord latch capability \n• Stereo ping-pong delay effect \n• Bender time modulation effect \n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing \n• Selectable envelope shapes and triggering behavior \n• Effortless MIDI CC mapping \n• Seamlessly backup presets to iCloud \n• Play mode for easier panel and keyboard interaction \n• A new take on the classic feedback/overload path \n\nSUPPORTS\n• All 64-bit iOS devices\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions (Including GarageBand)\n• MPE Controller Support \n• Ableton Link \n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI \n• MIDI Program Change Support \n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers \n• Share over AirDrop, Mail, or other iOS applications"

While a chord is played, related chords are highlighted so you can easily find chord sequences that progress smoothly. Once you found a nice chord sequence, you can drag and drop chords into your song to build your composition upon it.\nIf you want to start your song with a melody and find a suitable chord progression, you can do that just as well: select notes and tap the search icon to show chords that match your melody fragment. It's real fun to experiment, seeing how different harmonic contexts affect the perception of the same melodic fragment.\n\n\nCreate Beautiful Melodies and Flowing Chord Progressions\n\nIn the piano roll, notes that are in harmony as well as the chords' root notes are highlighted. This makes it super easy to create leads, arpeggios and basslines and to experiment with different chord voicings to let your chord progressions flowing nicely. \n\n\nIntuitive Editing\n\nA simple, yet feature rich and context-aware user interface helps you build up your ideas into whole songs:\nGroup sections into song parts and arrange them via drag and drop. \nDuplicate, copy and paste, playback selected notes.\n\n\nFile Export\n\nExport and share your creations with audio file export.\nEdit your song in other Apps with MIDI-file export.\n\n\nUse your Favorite Instrument Apps\n\nIt's just more fun to explore and create with those awesome Instrument Apps that are available in the App Store: Klimper supports Inter-App-Audio Instruments like Animoog and Model 15 as well as Audio Unit Instruments like Ripplemaker and Mersenne.\n\n\nVideo Tutorials\n\nThe included tutorial will help you getting started. Stay tuned for additional video tutorials published on our youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClWxkJLttqC8lQ1m2mqAfFw\n\n\n\nIncluded Instruments: \nSynthesizer engine with a range of tweakable sounds,\nGrand Piano, Acoustic Guitar, Acoustic Bass, Violin, Cello, Harp, Glockenspiel, 8-Bit Synth, Soft Synth Bass, Electric Drumset."

It features a wide variety of protocols; in addition to standard AM and FM modes found in most consumer radios it typically includes modes for LSB, USB, CW and other settings used to listen in on the CB radios used by taxi drives, marine weather stations, air traffic control towers, amateur radio enthusiasts and many other types of radio broadcasts. \n\nThe signals you can access using this app are not your own local radio stations; rather they are the radio stations in the vicinity of a collection of free servers, many of them operated by universities. These servers are positioned in many different countries around the world so using this plugin you can listen in on a variety of radio signals in a wide variety of languages and cultures. \n\n\nWHAT DO PEOPLE USE THIS PLUGIN FOR?\n\nThe crackly sound of an old-style AM broadcast or a conversation between taxi drivers on a CB radio is a musical flavour that can not be replicated with other plugins. If you are looking for some really unique and interesting material to include in your performances or mixes, this plugin will supply. \n\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nThis plugin requires Javascript in order to play sound. Unfortunately that means that the UI must be open the entire time you are using it. When the UI is closed Javascript stops running, similar to the way a website stops playing audio when you close a tab in your browser.\n\n\nNOTE: THIS IS AN AUDIO UNIT PLUGIN. IT RUNS INSIDE A HOST APP SUCH AS GarageBand."

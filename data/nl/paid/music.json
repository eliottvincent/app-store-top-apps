It offers unmatched flexibility in sound choices, tempo settings, meters, subdivision patterns and visual displays. Voice count-ins, the ability to create and edit preset groups and Ableton link for syncing multiple devices make this a superior tool for performers. \n\n• Ear training possibilities are endless. The high quality multi-sampled instrument sounds for symphonic instruments are unique among all other tuning applications. Listening skills can be developed through the use of the eight-octave keyboard, chromatic wheel and tone generator. There are no other sounds like these. \n\n• Learning is a social activity. Using features unique to the TonalEnergy Tuner, data can be collected, reviewed, edited and shared with others. Feedback is essential for growing and developing great performers. It’s all about connectivity.\n\nChris Coletti, member of The Canadian Brass, sums up TonalEnergy by saying,\n\n      “TonalEnergy is a must-have for any serious musician. It's a full suite of tools in one app; the tuner, tone generator, recorder, metronome and beautiful interface make it one of the best tools for musicians out there, period.” \n\nFEATURES\n\n• Recognizes a large pitch range, extending to lower registers than many competing tuners (C0 - C8) that is highly responsive to wind instruments, as well as acoustic and electric string instruments\n• Adjustable A=440 Hz reference \n• Automatic or manual transposing options\n• Instantly changes between equal, just and other custom temperaments, including user-defined ones\n• Auto or instant pitch reference note feature using the TonalEnergy sounds\n• Extensive tuning list for all orchestral string and fretted string instruments including many more features than most other string-only tuner apps\n• An expandable eight octave piano keyboard enhancing many of the key aspects of the tuner’s functions\n• Chromatic wheel tone generator, with optional auto-vibrato feature\n• Frequency and Harmonic energy overtone graphs, along with a multi-function waveform\n• Dedicated metronome page that matches or exceeds the features available on all other stand alone metronome apps\n• Notation options including standard English, Solfege, Northern European, and Indian variants\n• Bluetooth output/input support\n• Audio and Video recording capabilities including, editing, looping, timestretch that are all exportable via iTunes sharing, AirDrop, email, AudioCopy, SoundCloud, etc\n• Import music from iTunes Library or email attachments\n• Compatible with external microphones and clip-on vibration sensor devices\n• Supports external video output to an external display for use in rehearsal halls\n• External MIDI keyboard control support \n• Apple Watch app acts ONLY as a remote control for the phone app\n• Audiobus and inter-app audio support\n• VoiceOver support for the blind or visually impaired \n\nINSTRUMENT SOUNDS\n• Piccolo, Flute\n• Oboe, English Horn, Bassoon\n• Full Clarinet Family\n• Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Baritone Saxophone\n• Trumpet\n• French Horn\n• Tenor and Bass Trombone\n• Euphonium and Tuba\n• Square, sawtooth, and sine waveforms\n• Organ\n• Bowed and Plucked Strings"

      "label": "SENODE is an innovative music app based on the idea of finite state machines. It works like a polyphonic modular step sequencer with probabilistic steps. This app is perfect for generative music and complex sequencing setups. Senode syncronizes its clock to Ableton Link or integrates as AUv3 plugin. All actions are MIDI bindable, so the steps can be triggered in real time from drum pads, sensors or other apps – a real live-performance instrument!\n\n\"Senode is something quite different when it comes to sequencing\" - Create Digital Music\n\n\"I highly recommend Senode to everyone who is interested in generative music. It's such a fun app to work with!\" - haQ attaQ\n\n\"A Killer App!\" - A4iRebirth\n\n\nCREATE COMPLEX SEQUENCES WITH RANDOMIZATION\n\nThe core of Senode is a graph of nodes connected by edges. You decide if Senode acts like a simple vending machine or a complex pinball game. Each node triggers a sound when activated, while edges determine the direction of travel. Instruments are controlled by emitters which send their tokens onto the graph and generate MIDI signals. That means, you can compose a generative music piece for a whole orchestra using the graph notation and a couple of emitters! It gets more interesting if you add random directions or emit multiple tokens at different time positions.\n\n\nGRAPHICAL MULTI-TOUCH INTERFACE\n\nCompose and perform your music live using the intuitive multi-touch interface. Create, drag and connect nodes with multiple fingers. The on-screen keyboard helps you to visualize and edit notes easily.\n\n\nINTEGRATED SYNTHESIZER \n\nThe standalone app contains a simple but powerful subtractive synthesizer with main OSC (sine, saw, square, noise), sub OSC (sine), 1-pole lowpass filter, stereo reverb and ADSR envelope. Try the demo patches to get inspired!\n\n\nMIDI CONTROL AND STEP RECORDING\n\nUse the step record function to create new nodes on the fly, from single notes or using the chord detection. Use a drum kit, wearable sensors or any other MIDI device to control the steps of Senode. Enjoy the unique experience of being your own clock!\n\n\nCONTROL MUSIC APPS AND EXTERNAL DEVICES\n\nSenode is the perfect sequencer for all MIDI-capable apps. Play in sync with other apps using Ableton Link. Integrate with your favourite DAW using the AUv3 plugin (in-app purchase required). If you connect a MIDI interface, you can even control your hardware synths with the app.\n\n\nREALTIME CONTROL\n\nSenode is made for live music performance. There are no default \"beats\" or \"bars\" and all actions are performed in real time. Tokens can be quantized to a clock (16th resolution) and support catch-up, which means you can hit all functions like a drummer \"on the spot\" and stay in sync, even if you're too early or a little late. By the way, the really cool stuff will happen if you break free from 4/4 bar schemes, start your sequences on off-beat timings or create crazy polyrhythmic cycles...\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n- innovative non-linear graphical sequencer with draggable multi-touch interface\n- standalone app and AUv3 MIDI plugin (in-app purchase required) for iPad and iPhone\n- unlimited notes or chords per step with velocity, legato or fixed-length notes\n- unlimited number of steps and directions: cycles, randomized, one-shot\n- multi-timbral patches with polyphonic emitters\n- live arpeggiator mode with hold and monophonic option\n- integrated polysynth with sine, square, saw and noise OSC, ADSR, filter, reverb\n- real-time sequencer control with clock sync and catch-up quantization\n- MIDI device input and output\n- velocity-sensitive binding support for all sequencer operations like step, emit, tick, trigger or clear\n- tempo and start/stop synchronization using Ableton Link\n- step recording with chord detection\n- copy and paste functionality\n- transpose and clock divide functions\n- comes with tutorial and example patches that you can instantly play\n\nSee senode.org for more details."

Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content.

This synth sounds great. It is going to be top of the list for apps I use at live shows\" - App Store review\n\n\"This is the best $10 I've spent in a long time. I'm actually excited over what I will be able to do with Poison 202!\" - App Store review\n\n\"This is the best synth. Better than any soft synth or even hardware\" - App Store review\n\n--------\nPoison-202 is a professional Vintage Midi Synthesizer.

      "label": "Create surprising rhythms and harmonies by having colored shapes follow arrows on a two-dimensional grid.\n\nNew Path is a unique and playful tool that drastically changes the way you make music. Pick an instrument for each square or triangle (shapes) and let them walk around. Rotate the arrows to alter their paths. Now choose from an exotic list of arrow types to spice things up.\n\nShapes also have a mind of their own. By using crossroads and teleports they will have to decide for themselves which direction to take. This phenomenon will give you endless surprising results, but you’ll be able to keep full control by adjusting each crossroad/teleport bias.\n\n• Use the factory sets to play around and have lots of fun instantly! Or,\n• Create your own sets with the many features available!\n\n\nEach arrow contains adjustable values such as pitch, note duration, volume, etc, while shapes can interpret these values in their own way. For instance, a shape can add an octave to each pitch it comes across, so it will play all the notes one octave higher. \n\nUse delay and reverb to add flavor, use the advanced preset and generator systems to save and modify the grid, use the rules system to determine what should happen when two shapes meet, and much more.\n\nNew Path is also able to communicate with other hard- & software. With the MIDI out feature, New Path can control for example your hardware synthesizers. Use the Ableton Link feature to sync Link-enabled devices and play together with your friends. And finally, the Audiobus integration lets you send both audio and MIDI to other apps on your device (You will need the Audiobus app).\n\nKey Features\n• A well thought out interface designed for both fast editing and playing live on-stage\n• Have surprising results with exotic arrow types such as crossroads and teleports\n• 70+ instruments such as Drums, Bass, Plucked, Synths, Acoustic, and Fx\n• Midi editor with a scales system\n• Many useful shape settings such as: Attack, Release, Note Value Multiplier to make non-western rhythms, etc\n• A preset system to instantly save and recall grid and shape settings\n• An advanced grid generator/modulator\n• A system of “If-Then” rules to trigger actions when shapes meet each other\n• A mixer with Delay and Reverb\n• 5x5 Arrow Cells with data such as: velocity, note duration, note value, repeat chance, crossroad chance, CC out, and much more…\n• 9 Tutorials with example sets to get you started \n\nNew Path supports\n• Ableton Link\n• iCloud device sync\n• iCloud export/import\n• Audiobus support (midi and audio)\n• Midi out \n\nIn-App Purchase\n• Arrow Skins\n• Instrument Expansion Pack\n• Audio Unit v3 (AUv3)\n\nAbout AUv3\n• In case you bought New Path before 28th December 2022 (for $6.99), email a screenshot with proof of your purchasing date and we’ll email a promo code for the AUv3 feature (info@studiothezooo.com)\n\nGet New Path today to create a treasury of musical gems! \n\n* Runs on iPhone 5s with iOS 11.0 and above"

It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

Even still supporting iPod Touch 5th Gen and iPhone 4S! \n\nWatch on YouTube (http://youtu.be/rvp4QinakL0) or \nread below about\n \n- a new intuitive and concise user interface\n- less taps for common tasks\n- home automation integration\n- and current limitions (don't skip them ;) )\n\nor come over to my homepage www.sonophone.net with much more information and screenshots available.\n\nThis application is not endorsed by or associated with Sonos, Inc. (which is why it is not free)\n\n◆◆◆ a new intuitiv and concise user interface ◆◆◆\nSonoPhone is designed to leverage the latest iOS design principles:\n- Tap or drag the player on the top and you'll find the players view to select a new player and with volume controls for all players. From here you can also enter Zone Management, where you can group and ungroup players with drag and drop.\n- Tap or drag the Track infos on the bottom and you'll be at the big covers screen\n- Drag the main menu from any place to the left or right to have instant access to playlist or shortcuts\n- volume + progress popups: when changing volume or progress of a song, you get popups telling you the actual values. Stop guessing your desired values today!\n\n◆◆◆ less taps for common tasks ◆◆◆\nSonoPad tries to optimize most often used tasks to have the least taps needed. In the end you are able to navigate and control your players much more fluently.\n\n- Touch To Play: are you sick of always beeing asked what to do when you tap a track or album? SonoPhone defaults to just starting an album or song. A long press still gives you access to all options - you can also change the tap default in the settings menu. Want to build a playlist fast? Just set the default to 'always add to end' and off you go ...\n- tap an album cover image and the whole album starts to play immediately \n- aggregated search: search results are collapsed into one view, so you see immediately in what category you have the best results, without switching back and forth\n- shortcuts to most used functions: drag the main menu to the right to get shortcut buttons for artist, albums, radio and musicservices.\n- you can control the volume of every player directly from the player selection screen. No need to switch players anymore.\n\n◆◆◆ home automation integration ◆◆◆\n- you can start SonoPhone with the 'sonophone://' URL from other remote Apps. Its also possible to hand over a return URL, then a new icon is displayed to return to the automation App.\nFurther option include to select a default player or default menu, you can read more about all option on my homepage sonophone.net\n\n◆◆◆ Limitations ◆◆◆\n\n- all music services except Google Music are supported\n- no playing of music stored on iPhone yet\n- no options to set alarms or sleep settings\n- no support for discontinued WD100 dock\n\n◆◆◆ Other stuff ◆◆◆\n- Sonos is registered trademark of Sonos, Inc."

You can even view a device’s screen* to follow along as they play! Cue works with forScore 6.1 or later (sold separately).\n\nWith Dual Page mode, you can use forScore on one device and Cue on another device to display two full-sized pages simultaneously. Your page and its annotations are sent wirelessly, and tapping or swiping on either device turns two pages at a time—just like a book. Dual Page mode even supports links and buttons, so you can tap on them no matter which side they’re on and they’ll work just like you expect. Visit forScore.co/cue to learn more!\n\n*Performance can vary greatly based on settings, environmental factors, and network availability. A wi-fi connection is strongly recommended.

You can use it in individual lessons, home study, or in group classes with the built-in games or with games led by you. Because you know how you want to teach or how your students learn best, you can tailor the app to exactly what you want: \n\n• You define the notes on the grand staff that you want your student to drill. \n• You decide if the application should test or teach. \n• You decide how many cards to drill, how long to test, and how quickly students must answer. \n• You decide whether to drill in letter names, solfège, piano keyboard, and several other options.\n• You can review the incorrect notes and save them for student drilling. \n\nMusic Flash Class is designed for use with all ages: \n\n• You can lock the device’s orientation to accommodate each student’s way of holding the device. \n• You can discourage accidental disruption of the games by 'locking' buttons that would normally exit the play. \n• You can use built in games or design challenges for your students. \n\n\"I love the app....my students are competing against each other for time and decks completed without error!!!\" - Penny L., professional piano teacher \n\n\"This app has become a favorite backseat activity in my van.

      "label": "If you think FM Synthesis is complicated, it’s time to think again!\n\nBLEASS Omega places all of the sparkle, character, nuance and dynamic expressiveness of FM Synthesis at your fingertips, and does away with the arcane programming interfaces so often associated with FM. Harnessing BLEASS’ signature GUI technology, creating and crafting sounds in Omega is not just easier than with other FM synths, it’s easy – PERIOD!\n\nAll of the classic capabilities of FM Synthesis are available in BLEASS Omega – expressive electric pianos, deep thundering basses, crystal-clear pads, sparkling bells, and soulful leads. And thanks to the instrument’s analogue-style Waveshaper and multi-mode Filter, BLEASS Omega can inject powerful analogue-like flavour into those pure FM tones, giving searing filter sweeps, growling distortions, and harmonically-rich resonances.\n\nThe four FM operators that sit at the heart of BLEASS Omega are edited simultaneously from within a single screen, with all operator envelopes and controls available to the touch of your finger. This amazingly user-friendly approach makes light work of sound editing, and encourages experimentation and exploration in a way no other FM synth can achieve. \n\nWith eleven FM algorithms on offer, each providing a different way of interconnecting the four operators for radically different results, the sonic scope of BLEASS Omega is vast. The included library of over 200 professionally designed presets makes full use of this versatility, furnishing you with a varied and inspirational sound palette to use in your music making and sound design projects.\n\nBLEASS Omega fits in with your workflow and studio setup, no matter how you like to create. The iOS edition provides both standalone and AUv3 versions for use on iPad and iPhone, whilst the desktop edition for Windows and macOS comes as a VST3/AU plugin instrument, compatible with all major DAWs.\n\nMore information, tutorials and specifications on https://www.bleass.com/omega/"

      "label": "Description – Hip Licks for Saxophone Application\n \nHip Licks for Saxophone is designed to help saxophonists develop fluency in the jazz language by providing mainstream jazz vocabulary (swing/bop/post-bop) that nails the changes and lays great on the horn.\n \nThink of Hip Licks for Saxophone as a musical reference application, like a dictionary of great licks in all twelve keys, available when you need it. You can open the application to any page and just start playing.\n \nNeed something that will help you sound like a total pro while playing over the most challenging keys and chord progressions? Hip Licks for Saxophone is an indispensable resource that can immediately show\nyou how a professional player would approach those tough keys and chord progressions.\n \nCustom User Interface\n \nThis application features a customized user interface that makes this application fun and easy to use. When you launch the application, you’ll see a menu window that lets you choose to read through the entire contents of Hip Licks, page by page without the play-along tracks, or to load each set of licks with the accompanying play-along track. All page turns are automatic, and synchronized with the play-along track. \n\nTo start playing a sax demo track, simply click on the saxophone icon on the lower left side of the display, and the track will immediately begin to play.\n \nTo start playing a rhythm-section-only track, simply click on the drum icon on the lower right side of the display, and the track will immediately begin to play.\n \nSpecial Features of Hip Licks for Saxophone by Greg Fishman:\n \n• 168 Hip Licks – Each lick is unique and customized for each key, based on the best timbre, register and playability on the horn. The C7 lick is different than the B7 lick, which is different than the Bb7 lick, etc.\n \n• All fast tempo licks include both Slow Tempo and Fast Tempo Play-Along Tracks.\n \n• Hip Licks Nail the Most Popular Chord Progressions:\n \n– Major 7th, Dominant 7th, Dominant 7b9, Minor 7th, Minor 7b5, and Diminished 7th and Augmented 7th Chords\n– ii-7 / V7 / I Major (two and four-measure phrases)\n– ii-7b5 / V7b9 / i Minor (two and four-measure phrases)\n– Parallel Major to Minor Progressions\n– ii- ii-Maj7 / ii-7 V7 / I Maj7 (ii-7 / V7 / I Maj7 w/moving 7ths)\n \n• Interactive Call and Response Format, perfect for ear-training and developing your musical memory. Each lick is played twice in a row on the Play-Along Tracks, so you can hear the lick and then immediately play along.\n \n• Twelve Key Approach – Every track takes you through all twelve keys.\n \n• Rhythm-Section-Only Tracks let you experiment with your own variations on the licks and improvise over a wide variety of harmonic settings. These tracks are also excellent backgrounds for practicing all of your chords and scales.\n \n• Technique Builder – Use Hip Licks for Saxophone as part of your daily practice routine to dramatically increase your technical command of the saxophone.\n\nIf you have any other issues/problems with the app, please contact me at greg@gregfishmanjazzstudios.com or call 847-334-3634. All of my books and apps are 100% guaranteed!"

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store.

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "Built for Live performance and hands free use, Quantiloop recreates the simplicity of a hardware loop pedal in an iOS app. Attach a MIDI foot controller and control it the way you want. No MIDI controller at hand; just preset your loop length, enable auto–record or a count–in and your loops will automatically close, no hands or feet required. Big onscreen controls allow for easy configuration and tactile control by vocalists or beat boxers. Focus on your performance instead of fiddling with dip switches or complex menu’s.\n\nBe Creative\n\nCreate 4 tracks with endless layers of overdubs to build your performance. Record a Chorus, Verse and Bridge and switch between them seamlessly or create a 1 bar percussie loop on track one, a 4 bar chord progression on track two and layer a bass line on top, all in perfect synchronisation.\n\nRhythm Guide\n\nThe builtin rhythm guide provides a rhythmic backing. Use the internal metronome for practice, import drum loops from virtually anywhere or host and control your favourite rhythm apps to enhance your performance. MIDI master lets you control MIDI hardware, and MIDI slave lets Quantiloop follow it. Ableton Link lets you even play in time over WiFi with external apps and devices. Quantisation aligns your actions to the nearest measure or beat so you stay in time, and real-time tempo control sets the pace. Prefer setting your own pace, disable quantisation and Quantiloop will react to your actions with minimum latency to create tight synchronised recordings.\n\nFX\n\nAssign up to 3 simultaneous effects to the input. Use the built-in transpose to covert your guitar into a bass, or host your guitar amp sim directly in Quantiloop. The results will be recorded into your loops.\nOr assign up to 3 simultaneous track effects to the output. Use the tape stop to add drama, introduce a key change to build up your performance, or host an Inter-App audio/AU reverb processor. Track FX may be assigned to a single track, all tracks or the combined output.\n\nFeatures\n\n•\tFree, Synced and Paralel,Serial, Mixed Playing Styles\n•\tMultiple Quantise Modes\n•\tMultiple Stop Modes\n•\tUnique Dub Mode and Mute Mode\n•\tUnlimited Overdubs\n•\tOverdub Decay\n•\tUndo / Redo\n•\tAuto Record\n•\tHigh quality stereo audio\n•\tClear loop status display\n•\tRhythm guide with optional auto-start, auto-stop and count-in\n•\tAudible and Visual Metronome\n•\tSend start, stop and host sync to hosted rhythm apps.\n•\tSync to host when embedded in an Inter-App-Audio host\n•\tReal-time Tempo Control\n•\tExtensive MIDI control\n•\tMultiple Assignments per MIDI controller (tap, hold, double tap)\n•\tMIDI Program Change support for changing presets\n•\tSupports Audiobus and Inter-App-Audio and Audio Units (AUv3)\n•\tIndividual outputs for each track and rhythm\n•\tSynchronise to other apps and devices with Ableton Link\n•\tMIDI clock sync (both slave and master)\n•\t4 physical/iaa/au/audiobus inputs routable to any track\n•\t8 outputs (main, monitor, track 1-4, rhythm, input out)\n•\t3 assignable input Fx, including transpose, reverb and IAA, AUv3\n•\t3 assignable track Fx, including transpose, reverse, tape stop, fade and IAA, AUv3\n•\tCloud (iCloud, Dropbox, Audioshare …) import / export\n•\tAudioCopy/Paste\n•\tOpen In\n•\tStore Phrase Presets in unlimited banks with 100 presets each\n•\tIndividual Volume and panning controls for each track"

      "label": "Chord! is a chord and scale reference that works with any fretted instrument like guitar, basses, ukulele, banjos,… It computes and analyses all the possible fingerings for chords, scales, and arpeggios.\n\nWith Chord!, you can also write a song by simply dragging and dropping chords, transpose it in any key, compute the fingerings with any tuning and generate a beautiful print-ready PDF, etc.\n\nYou can also import your existing songs in text format (please note that the app does not ship with songs). You can also link audio tracks from your music library and play them at the same time while adjusting their pitch and/or speed.\n\nYou don't even have to know music theory to use it: behind its brute force, the app knows how to handle by itself some subtleties of music to give meaningful results.\n\nIf you don't have to be an advanced player to use the app, you can however take a look under the hood and tweak the parameters if you like! Whatever is your level or your instrument, Chord! will adapt and give you the most precise answer.\n\nYou can search for any chord, split (like D/F#), or not. If you're a beginner, you can choose the chord from a list, but you can also use the intelligent keyboard to enter the chord as it is written. If this keyboard is a great way to enter chords, it is also very useful to discover and understand how the chords are formed. You can also enter some notes on a neck to find which chords it can be. You can hear how each fingering sounds. Chord arpeggios are also supported, as well as drop voicings (drop 2, drop3, etc.).\n\nThe app also ships with the biggest list of named scales (and you can create your own scales). It analyses and presents them with nice interactive views (scale, score, and keyboard). Of course, it can also lay down these scales on a neck (with sound) and compute their fingerings. Like for chords, you can even search for a scale from its fingering!\n\nEach scale can be harmonized (decomposed into chords). You can also enter a sequence of chords to find which scale you can use to improvise onto.\n\nYou can use one of the hundred tunings that ship with the app, or you can add your own ones, for any instrument, with or without a capo, even with broken strings if you want!\n\nThe app uses custom and unique algorithms to generate charts, easily input complex harmonic structures, extract chords from fingerings, determine finger positions, compute keys of scales, generate chords from scales and find scales that go well with some chords.\n\nFor example, Chord! is the right tool in these situations:\n• You want to have your songbook available at any time, in your pocket;\n• You're a beginner and you want to know how to play easily a D/F# chord;\n• One gave you a ukulele and you want to know how to tune it and how to play the G Hawaiian scale;\n• You want to know on what scale you can improvise for some chord sequence (and the answer can be different than the Pentatonic minor!);\n• You want to print your song and share it with your band.\n• You want to experiment with this nice open tuning, moreover with a bottleneck;\n• Your little sister can't make bar chords and you want to show her how she can do without bars, with three (little) fingers only;\n• You want to impress your little sister by showing her how you can play the same chords with two bars!\n• You want to understand how this fingering for C13 is actually a fingering for C13;\n• You broke a string and want to know how to play some chords without;\n• You want to know how Django managed to play with two and a half fingers.\n\nThe app fully supports left-handed instruments.\n\nMain functions of the app:\n- Write, transpose, fingerize, print, and share songs;\n- Search chord fingerings (or chord charts);\n- Search chords from fingerings;\n- Search scale fingerings;\n- Search scales from fingerings;\n- Search chords from scale;\n- Search scales from chords."

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

It's an incredible tool for all audio engineers and musicians ... My mixing has improved by leaps and bounds after just a few weeks with Quiztones.”\n\n- Austin McAllister\n\n\nA professional Audio Engineer of 10 years, I've come across many ear training devices, blind tests, and software. This app is TOPS! Highly recommended! The developers are serious about what they do. You will not be disappointed!\n\n- Joel Avery\n\n——\n\nWhy We Created Quiztones EQ Ear Training Apps ...\n\nWe thought there should be an easier way to learn how to use EQ, train your ears and expedite the path to getting professional quality mixes, recordings and productions.\n\nWhen I was at music school ten years ago studying audio engineering and music production, my teacher turned an iMac around, pulled up an EQ in Pro Tools and started quizzing the class on which audio frequencies he was boosting or cutting in a mix. That's when it hit me — this should be an app, with various difficulty levels, a scoring system and the ability to import your own source material for quizzes that will teach you how to use EQ like a pro.\n\nFast forward to today — 50k app downloads later — and we're still just as excited to keep evolving Quiztones to help you take the quality of your mixes, recordings and productions to the next level."

A GPU-powered, fast and advanced integrated editor is part of TouchOSC on all platforms - create the most complex of control layouts with ease and precision.\n\nMIDI, OSC and more...\n\nTouchOSC supports sending and receiving any number of MIDI and OSC messages on many connections simultaneously. On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

      "label": "Note reading made fun! Note Rush is a game for practising note reading on the music staff to help you learn to play the piano, keyboard, flute, saxophone, violin... you name it! Note Rush shows you one note at a time in random order then uses the microphone to listen as you play through them like you would with note reading flash cards, only these flash cards check that you're playing the right note! \n\nPlay with a bunch of fun themes and race to earn stars and beat your best time! Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting. I'm thankful he can do this on his own and it keeps track of his high scores which is highly motivating for him.\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"A blockbuster hit with teachers and students... I especially like using it at group lessons.\" - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me \n\n\"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching.\" - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!\" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club.\" - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com\n\n*** Having trouble? See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student, with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students improve their note recognition across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

We spent a lot of time analysing iconic analog synths, both vintage and modern, to find out which parts of the circuit contribute most to their specific character. We used this knowledge to create a unique synth, with focus on what’s most important - the pure, organic and detailed sound. Many analog synth emulations sound dull. Not Zeeon. We take care of the entire spectrum range from deep lows to sweet highs. All audio and modulation signals are processed at 176 KHz (4x oversampling).\n\nFull manual and audio demos available at the BeepStreet website.\n\nFeatures\n\n• Audio Unit v3 and standalone application with a simple polyphonic step sequencer\n\n• 2 oscillators with continuously variable waveforms, hard-sync and sub-oscillator. Carefully simulated analog drift and PSU influence.\n\n• Filter: 3 models available: Transistor ladder low pass, OTA cascade low pass and State Variable Filter with continuously variable LP-HP + BP mode. \n\n• 2 low frequency oscillators and envelope generators per voice.\n\n• Overdrive: diode clipper, transistor saturation, wave folder, pre and post filter.\n\n• Up to 2 layers per voice. Layers can modulate each other.\n\n• Powerful modulation matrix offering self-modulation and cross-layer modulation, 8 modulation slots, 17 signal sources and 41 targets available, both from modulation modules and audio signal path. This takes Zeeon into semi-modular territory. Imagine oscillator waveform, panning, filter cutoff, resonance or LP-HP mode modulated by oscillators or another layer!\n\n• Effects unit: Circuit modelled BBD chorus, bass booster, zero-delay Phaser, Stereo delay and Reverb.\n\n• 144 presets and Tutorials bank.\n\nMore presets and exciting features in upcoming updates."

      "label": "A classic is reborn! With its introduction nearly a decade ago, Magellan pushed the boundaries of iOS technology and quickly took its place among the platform’s most popular synths. Continuing this pedigree, Yonac’s flagship Magellan Synthesizer 2 is a new alchemy of pristine sounds, innovative features, and devotion to user friendliness — all the same preserving the wicked soul of the original.\n\nCutting-edge synthesis technology, punchier tones, warmer filters, greater modulation options, AUv3, MPE, brand-new presets: these are just a few of Magellan’s features for a whole new era.\n\nSIGNAL GENERATORS\n\nMagellan’s beating heart is its three realtime virtual-analog oscillators: with their pulse width and blend parameters, the first two connect to a unique Timbre module to derive many additional waveforms. A special Oscillator Unison stage activates additional “secret” oscillators to supply up to 24 oscillators per voice — perfect for supersaws, or true chorus/flange effects obtained right at the synthesis stage. A fully configurable Maximizer module helps create even bigger stereophonic sounds by activating up to 120 simultaneous oscillators per voice. \n\nFM\n\nA powerful yet intuitive FM module gives life to Magellan’s unique hybrid design. With its very own ADSR and variable contour generator (with 3 different envelope shapes), it works as an additional sound source and transforms Magellan 2 into a very capable frequency modulation synthesizer. Combined with other oscillators and modulation features, it generates strong multi-layered textures impossible via subtractive synthesis alone.\n\nFILTERS\n\nTwo independent filter banks, 11 different filters, series/parallel selection with variable balance — these newfangled filters incorporate nonlinearities and analog-derived quirks that impart them hefty servings of aural “sugar”. The addition of “FAT” controls helps give added gravitas and harmonic content. Dedicated ADSRs (with extra long maxes) feature A/B/C contour generators for totally different playing characteristics.\n\nMODULATION\n\nTwin LFOs, modulation envelope, as well as direct control: the backbone of a powerful and versatile modulation system that can take 16 simultaneous targets, each with its own variable amount. In addition, each LFO/Envelope target can be assigned a secondary control (including via MIDI) to dynamically vary or even “piggyback” its modulating signal. The inbuilt XY-pad can hit any pair of 140 parameters for realtime control, while the “EZ Velocity” module helps quickly dial in the right touch for amplitude, filters & FM.\n\nSPAWN2\n\nSecond generation Yonac SPAWN unlocks the power of A.I. to help create countless original presets. Powered with an Expert mode, three different algorithms, and configurable machine autonomy down to module level, you can produce anything from subtle variations on a theme to wild new sounds with unrivaled “hit rate” — all at the touch of a button.\n\nAUv3, MIDI & MPE\n\nThe ultra-efficient synth engine and flexible user interface are specially designed so that you can run many Magellans simultaneously in your favorite AUv3 DAW or Mixer. Along with massively featured MIDI I/O (complete with MIDI learn/recall, program changes, et al.), Magellan 2 is also MPE compatible with full polyphonic pitch control. Aftertouch and even CC74 are assignable through the mod matrices — and the new onscreen MagTOUCH MPE controller provides voice-wise expression not only within Magellan, but to other MPE apps/devices and inside compatible DAWs as well.\n\n...AND MORE\n\nAnalog-inspired 32x4 step/pattern sequencer with gate, velocity and skip; ChordMaker with note matrix that maps one key into a chord; powerful, easy-to-use arp with live & program modes;  FX rack featuring 10 stereo units and configurable signal flow; 360+ factory presets, with a bank custom produced by Sunsine Audio; Ableton Link, YPAT3 preset management, patch translator, app recorder are just a few more of Magellan Synthesizer 2 features."

Discover new ways to create and construct unusual and exciting sounds from any environmental audio recordings or samples recorded from other apps through Inter-App audio or Audiobus.\n\nThe main advantage is that you can record and modify samples along the way within the single app. You can record sounds and noises, delete unwanted parts and then use presets to give a whole new sounding or create spectacular soundscapes and textures to use them as loops in this app. And even use FieldScaper as effect in real time with other apps or external input.\n\nThe FieldScaper consists of two main parts. The first part is the field recorder with special options for different ways of record environmental sound from microphone or record other sound sources. With the sample editor you can cut or split the source sample for more convenient use. The second part is the scaper sound engine that with using dynamic presets can easily transform the most ordinary sounds into something absolutely different. These parts connect with each other into one whole but you can use recorder or scaper independently.\n\nThe FieldScaper supports complete MIDI control for all faders, knobs and many buttons. You can change the parameters of oscillators, filters, delays and mixer by using any external MIDI controller or MIDI apps like sequencers. With the MIDI controllers this app becomes very comfortable to use at live performance. \n\nField recorder:\n\n- Auto start record when input signal appears.\n- Auto stop record when signal below threshold or by time.\n- Record series of samples by a signal presence.\n- Recorder timer in seconds or measure (sync with BPM).\n- Input signal monitor with different modes.\n- Automatic gain control, cut off input filters and noise gate.\n- Advanced sample editor (delete, trim, split, cut, copy, paste, undo).\n- Filter and normalizer for recorded sample.\n\nScaper sound engine:\n\n- Loop based mode for processing input in real time as effect.\n- Three sample-based oscillators, each with set of effects.\n- Low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-stop filters with resonance.\n- Two range delay with smooth time change and additional modes.\n- Advanced spatial mixer / reverb with changing of side and distance.\n- Three-band parametric equalizer for each oscillator.\n- Wide range changing of oscillator speed with option of reverse.\n- Distortion effect based on breaking addressing of samples (like on circuit bending).\n- Complex effect contains lofi, overload, noise, ringmod, flanger, phaser.\n- Step sequencer can control selected parameter and envelope generator (ADSR).\n- Individual or group of LFO for each effect with additional modes and BPM sync.\n- The \"Main effect\" function for control several parameters simultaneously.\n\nAdditional features:\n\n- More 50 predefined presets with wide range of effects.\n- Scenes for storing and loading all operation parameters.\n- Pack the scene and all its samples and presets to single file.\n- Convenient file manager with groups of files by name or date.\n- Access samples and records via standard iOS app \"Files\".\n- Complete MIDI control for all faders, knobs and other modes.\n- Adaptive UI for portrait and landscape orientation.\n- Different color schemes available for UI.\n- Detailed application description (built-in and PDF file).\n- Inter-App audio compatible (with transport and BPM controls).\n- Supports Audiobus 3 with \"State Saving\" and MIDI features.\n- Supports Ableton Link with start / stop sync.\n\nRequirements:\n \nThird generation of iPad or fifth generation of iPhone and higher is required.\n\nYou can find more details about FieldScaper on the website:\n\nhttps://motion-soundscape.blogspot.com\n\nOverview and demo:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/n9nQRN6xWGo\nhttps://youtu.be/cCr5UPkdMY0\nhttps://youtu.be/Kp88NkJpy2M"

      "label": "LayR is a massively polyphonic, multi-timbral synthesizer for iOS devices, optimized for modern 64 bit CPUs and capable of delivering up to 256 voices of rich, multi-layered and textured sounds. \n\nLayR's primary sound components are called Performances where a Performance is a set of Instruments and each Instrument is a set of Layers and each Layer is a complete synthesizer.  A performance can consist of any number of instruments each with its own MIDI channel and crossfading keyboard span. Each Instrument can consist of any number of Layers to a maximum of 128.\n\nEach Layer has a dual oscillator that can morph with modulation between two shapes and phase states, two rich and warm state variable filters, a wave folder and a mixing section to blend oscillators and filters in any serial/parallel combination. \n\nFor modulation (frequency, amplitude and phase) there are two Low Frequency Oscillators ranging from DC to audio frequency switchable to optionally follow keyboard pitch and restart phase when a note is started. Two loopable ADSR envelopes ranging from fractions of a second to over 100  seconds, an amplitude ADSR and a random number generator with a smoothing filter. With stereo delay, reverb and EQ on the output section LayR excels at not only emulating normal analog synth sounds but also at creating massive pads and huge spacy ambient textures with extremely long evolution cycles. \n\nFocused at keyboard players looking for a mobile synth that can be reliably used live on stage LayR is equally at home in the studio. An extensive selection of usable instrument and performance presets are included which can be loaded using MIDI bank select and program change messages in the same manner as hardware synths. \n\nLayR sports almost unparalled and extremely flexible MIDI control. Every parameter in the synth engine can be assigned to any MIDI Control Change number and parameters spread across multiple Layers can be grouped and controlled by a single MIDI cc with assignable range and direction.\n\nThere is also an 8 track, 16 step Arpeggio Sequencer which can be used to create all sorts of exciting polyrhythmic looped patterns or even ambient generative music. Each track can have it's own speed, playback mode and length. \n\nOn top of all that LayR has a MIDI Controller Mixer that can be used during performance to control the synth engine in real time and can also transmit MIDI cc's from LayR's output port to other destinations.\n\nFull IAA, Audiobus, Audio Unit and Link compatibility means LayR can be used with all hosts and other music apps on iOS and desktop DAWs."

      "label": "Songzap is The World’s First Pre-Production App for Songwriters, Musicians, Singers and MCs!\n\nSongzap simplifies drum programming, multitrack recording, song arrangement and mixing, and brings these capabilities literally to a musician’s fingertips. It helps take the guesswork out of song development and enables artists to capture and expand their musical ideas. Songzap focuses on the creative aspects of songcraft and pre-production, helping songwriters to design and interact with beats, experiment with song structures, refine performance approaches, develop and reflect on recordings, and mix a high-quality demo that can be shared with others. You don’t need any technical knowledge to use Songzap – just a passion for making music! \n\nDespite being so simple and intuitive, Songzap is also designed for helping experienced musicians, songwriters and MCs to become more prolific in creating and signing-off songs, harnessing creative inspiration and capturing ideas on the go. So if music is your thing, Songzap is for you!\n\nONE-TIME PURCHASE!\n\nSongzap is a one-time purchase app, there is no recurring subscription charge for using this app. You buy it, you own it. Our goal is to help people make more and better music and we aim to keep our app prices as low as possible to ensure all musicians can benefit!\n\nSongzap is developed by musicians for musicians.

We have developed Songzap with the intention of narrowing this gap.\n\nUsing our app you can approach song-making directly, from a variety of tried and tested starting points: by recording your voice and instruments using your phone’s onboard microphone; by putting a groove down first to guide your performance and develop ideas; by experimenting with different song structures and looping sections of a song; and by balancing your recordings and rhythmic elements with intuitive mixer functions. Then, you can export your song to share with the world, or export a folder with all your project assets (full-resolution mix, individual tracks, arrangement markers, lyrics, notes, and drum MIDI data) to bring into the studio for further development. You can also import recordings and bounce down tracks, for unlimited layering!\n\nGET SUPPORT AT THE SONGZAP WEBSITE\n\nThe Songzap website (www.songzap.app) is a one-stop-shop for everything you need to be inspired about music making and getting the best results from Songzap, including:\n\n• Tutorials and extensive videos on all aspects of using Songzap\n• Advice on the art of songwriting and pre-production\n• Demo movie of how Songzap’s developers use the app in creating their own music \n• Blogs and guest articles on songcraft and musical creativity\n\nGet your songs into shape with Songzap!"

Everything still there but with an exciting improvement: now you can use all the power of the Exponential Sine Sweep technique for the measurement process, so your results can be extremely precise and accurate.\nYou can also, save, load and export results in common spreadsheet format.\nThe app can also generate pdf reports with photos.\nA tutorial slideshow explains the app use.\nRequired at least iOS 11.0"

As the trade winds blow through the palm-trees , Manuel can be seen swaying to the rhythm of the music.  Now with Marvelous Manuel’s Magnificent Maracas you too can shake and shimmy to your own beat!\n\nMarvelous Manuel’s Magnificent Maracas is a maracas simulator.  When you shake your device it will produce the same sounds as if you were holding a real set of maracas in your hand.  You can play along with your favorite music,  swinging and shaking to the music.  If you really get into the music it can be a great form of exercise.  The maracas shaking sound can also be achieved by tapping the picture of the maracas on the main screen.  A different swirling sound can be achieved by dragging your finger from the picture of the maracas down to the bottom (near the handles) without lifting your finger from the screen.  Marvelous Manuel’s Magnificent Maracas also has a \"Music\" and  a \"Play / Pause\" button.  The \"Music\" and \"Play / Pause\" buttons were first introduced in the new version of Big Daddy'O Bongos (bdBongos Version 3.5) a bongo simulator, which is also available on iTunes.  You can pick a song from your device's playlist from within the app.  Simply tapping the \"Music\" button will give you a list of the songs on your device.  Pick one or more song and press the \"Done\" button.  You will then return to  Marvelous Manuel’s Magnificent Maracas were the music is ready to be play by tapping the \"Play / Pause\" button.\n\nPressing the \"Information\" button will take you to the copyright information page where Marvelous Manuel dances across the screen to the rhythms of the original musical sound track, Chi Chi Cha Cha."

We started by creating a dustbin sound system (garbage can for our American friends). We got a real dustbin and put some speakers in it! After it all was done, we ended up with an interesting creative audio effect plugin called Dustbin!\n\nThis plugin will litter-ally change your life. Stop wasting time, you can’t refuse it any longer. Take everything you thought you knew about music production and throw it out.\n\nImagine you left two easily entertained idiots alone with a dustbin, amp, speaker, some microphones, and a worrying idea. Well actually, you don’t have to imagine at all, because Dustbin is here to answer those musical questions you never asked.\n\nPick your way through the impulse responses taken from the Bin’s cavity and built-in speaker. Transform your Garage into Garbage, Rap into Scrap, Pop into Slop, Punk into Junk, and New Age into Sewage.\n\nNo more worrying about IF your music sounds trash, now it definitely does. You’re welcome.\n\nDustbin is both a stand-alone application as well as an AUv3 plugin, meaning it works within iOS and iPadOS hosts such as GarageBand."

So your drum sounds are lacking punch and lost in the mix? This is where Drum Doctor can really help by allowing you to literally shape and boost your kit to break through the mix safetly and without clipping.\n\nThe attack or onset of a sound is known as its transient. By controlling the level, shape and duration of these sounds, you change the dynamics of a drum track to achieve that perfect tightness, while boosting them to give your kick the right punch and snare the right amount of bite.\n\nUse the saturation to overdrive your mix prior to shaping.  This can drastically change the character of some drum sounds at the filtering stage. The single LP/HP filtering knob lets you quickly find the tone that suits combined with the 8 band EQ to define your sound. \n\nFinally the intensity knob allows you to control the level of dynamics applied to your mix. Automate this in real time when you want to relax or accentuate your drum track during your song.\n\nFeatures:\n\n○ Supports factory and user presets.\n○ Add bite using the Attack & Hold controls.\n○ Use the Release to get extra dynamic range.\n○ Both Attack and Release can be inverted to transform the dynamics. \n○ LP/HP filtering.\n○ Saturation control.\n○ 8 Band Graphic EQ.\n○ Real-time gain display.\n○ Intensity control to amplify the effect up to 200%.\n○ Limiter/clipper for driving your sound to the max.\n○ Auto ranging option for graphing."

A custom character can mapped to \n- A specific MIDI note or,\n- A specific note in the scale like the first note in the scale, the third note in the scale etc. \n\nUnless a character is custom mapped, a letter in English alphabet or a number, it will be a rest in the sequencer. \nAlso, you can randomise the velocity and gate lengths in each step if you want,\nYou can enable it on the settings menu and set a randomization min-max range.\n\nTextquencer is a MIDI app and does not create any sound on its own. You need to route Textquencer's MIDI output to your audio app's MIDI input. The standalone app supports Ableton Link. For using the AUv3 plugin, you need an AUv3 host app such as AUM, Cubase, Nanostudio etc."

      "label": "XAir Monitor Mixer is a personal monitor mixer for select Behringer and Midas digital mixers. It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

      "label": "The latest title in the KORG DS-10 series, now available for the iOS!\n\nThe KORG DS-10 series was an enormous hit for the Nintendo DS. Now, seven years later, it has undergone a further evolution while staying true to its original spirit. Now available is the KORG iDS-10, a portable synthesizer studio for iOS. \n\nThe KORG iDS-10 combines a cutting-edge analog synthesizer, voice synthesizer, and analog drum machine inspired by motifs from the original KORG DS-10. This iOS app gives you a hand-held system to easily create electronic music, which requires persuasive sound with a minimal number of notes.\n\n*** Powerful analog synthesizer lets you visually learn sound design ***\nThe analog synthesizer provides carefully selected parameters, making it easy to enjoy sound design. The unique patching function also lets you create sound in even deeper ways. Since all parameters can be automated, you have a wide range of song-production possibilities. Each synthesizer provides five types of effect with an oscilloscope that helps you see the sound. This cutting-edge synth engine takes full advantage of the iOS device’s CPU to generate astonishing sound, and will heighten your enjoyment using the KORG DS-10.\n\n*** Enter your lyrics, and the voice synthesizer turns them into a voice ***\nThe voice synthesizer is one of the popular features of the KORG iDS-10. Based on a vocoder, its engine makes it easy to generate voices. It also supports input via a microphone which can be used as a conventional vocoder. The parameters are optimized for creating such voices, so you’ll be able to enjoy sound design with a different character than an analog synthesizer, further widening the possibilities for your music.\n\n*** Analog drum synthesizer makes it easy to produce the sounds that you want ***\nDrums are now more important than ever, and the iDS-10 provides an analog drum machine that’s carefully tuned for easy creation of powerful sounds. With total control over six drum sounds (kick, snare, hihat1 / ihat2, tom, and percussion), you can create awesome tracks with high impact.\n\n*** Smart keyboard and KAOSS mode make step-recording enjoyable ***\nThe smart keyboard lets you specify a scale so that you can step-record without worrying about “wrong” notes. And of course there’s also KAOSS mode, where you can produce a limitless range of great-sounding phrases, with just a touch of the keyboard. The scale setting is also applied to the sequencer’s note display, so you can enjoy producing songs whether or not you have any musical knowledge or experience.\n\n*** Pattern play that you can perform in real time ***\nThe pattern play capability of the KORG DS10 has further evolved, generating amazing user performances. You can seamlessly play 32 patterns, and also manipulate track mute and solo settings in real time. It’s guaranteed to result in the kind of protean acts that are notable in modern day DJ performances.\n\n*** Send your songs by email for collaborative music productions ***\nThere’s a function that allows the transfer of song data via email, making it easy to exchange songs with your friends.\n\n*** Mystery bingo!? ***\nAnd then there’s the enigmatic mystery bingo; as you continue enjoying the KORG iDS-10, the full picture will become clearer …\n\nThis app was produced in cooperation with the game music and app production company “Detune.” Don’t miss this opportunity to experience the world of the KORG iDS-10 that resulted from this collaboration with Detune Inc.\n\nThe first title in the KORG DS-10 series was the KORG DS-10 which was announced in 2008. The second title was the KORG DS-10 PLUS which launched in 2009.\nThese are products of Marvelous Inc.

      "label": "A Real Time Analyzer for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Test your speakers, tune your room, do acoustical analysis work or just have a better understanding of audio frequencies. RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools."

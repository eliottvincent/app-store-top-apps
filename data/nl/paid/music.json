Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "Way more than a metronome, the Time Trainer adds five training tools to help you develop your own internal sense of time!\n\nThis is an accurate and stable metronome (many metronome apps out there are not) and features:\n• tap tempo (to work out tempos by tapping a button),\n• countdown timer (for keeping your practice to schedule!)\n• many different sounds (you like cowbell, wood or xylophone?)\n• accent control (for odd time playing)\n• visual metronome movement with a flash on the beat\n• vibrate option (on each beat or just accent)\n\n...but then we add to that with five training tools which will really help you develop your own time feel - essential for all musicians!\n\n• Bar Breaks • will mute the metronome for a bar or more forcing you to keep your time solid and be perfectly synchronized when the clicks return! This is a superb exercise and will really help develop confidence in holding your tempo. You can adjust how many bars are solid at the start then how many bars are solid and how many bars are muted which will cycle for the duration of the session. You can also select \"random\" mode and a % of bars (that you set) that will be dropped for an even more challenging practice session!\n\n• Random Beat Drop • does exactly what it says on the tin... some of the beats (clicks) will be muted at random, forcing you to be confident with your time and not rely on the click too much. Many people chase the beat or try and anticipate it, and this exercise will help you stop those bad habits! I've personally found that the \"gradual\" setting is most useful, a five minute session starting at 100% with more and more beats muted up to the % that you set.\n\n• Speed Up • is a tool I have wanted for years for my own practice so now I made one. Often when working on scales, arpeggios or licks you want to start at an easy speed where you are playing it 100% correctly and gradually push your technique by playing it faster and faster. With this tool you set a start tempo, end tempo and duration of you practice session and off you go, no more stopping to bump the bpm up a few notches every minute!\n\n• Step Upper • Many people requested that we make a programmable mode, most likely to be used to be able to move from one consistent tempo to another, rather than the gradual increase you get in the Speed Upper. You can program a tempo for X number of bars OR minutes :)\n\n• Subdivisions • Another heavily requested feature was to add in subdivisions for those that need to hear them, and for super slow tempo's where having subdivisions can be really helpful!\n\nI'm sure you will find all of the tools very useful, and of course you will find full support on the justinguitar community forum - please take the time to rate and review it, good things will help promote it and anything negative will help me improve it!\n\nWishing you many happy hours of practice :) Justin"

      "label": "Create surprising rhythms and harmonies by having colored shapes follow arrows on a two-dimensional grid.\n\nNew Path is a unique and playful tool that drastically changes the way you make music. Pick an instrument for each square or triangle (shapes) and let them walk around. Rotate the arrows to alter their paths. Now choose from an exotic list of arrow types to spice things up.\n\nShapes also have a mind of their own. By using crossroads and teleports they will have to decide for themselves which direction to take. This phenomenon will give you endless surprising results, but you’ll be able to keep full control by adjusting each crossroad/teleport bias.\n\n• Use the factory sets to play around and have lots of fun instantly! Or,\n• Create your own sets with the many features available!\n\n\nEach arrow contains adjustable values such as pitch, note duration, volume, etc, while shapes can interpret these values in their own way. For instance, a shape can add an octave to each pitch it comes across, so it will play all the notes one octave higher. \n\nUse delay and reverb to add flavor, use the advanced preset and generator systems to save and modify the grid, use the rules system to determine what should happen when two shapes meet, and much more.\n\nNew Path is also able to communicate with other hard- & software. With the MIDI out feature, New Path can control for example your hardware synthesizers. Use the Ableton Link feature to sync Link-enabled devices and play together with your friends. And finally, the Audiobus integration lets you send both audio and MIDI to other apps on your device (You will need the Audiobus app).\n\nKey Features\n• A well thought out interface designed for both fast editing and playing live on-stage\n• Have surprising results with exotic arrow types such as crossroads and teleports\n• 70+ instruments such as Drums, Bass, Plucked, Synths, Acoustic, and Fx\n• Midi editor with a scales system\n• Many useful shape settings such as: Attack, Release, Note Value Multiplier to make non-western rhythms, etc\n• A preset system to instantly save and recall grid and shape settings\n• An advanced grid generator/modulator\n• A system of “If-Then” rules to trigger actions when shapes meet each other\n• A mixer with Delay and Reverb\n• 5x5 Arrow Cells with data such as: velocity, note duration, note value, repeat chance, crossroad chance, CC out, and much more…\n• 9 Tutorials with example sets to get you started \n\nNew Path supports\n• Ableton Link\n• iCloud device sync\n• iCloud export/import\n• Audiobus support (midi and audio)\n• Midi out \n\nIn-App Purchase\n• Arrow Skins\n• Instrument Expansion Pack\n• Audio Unit v3 (AUv3)\n\nAbout AUv3\n• In case you bought New Path before 28th December 2022 (for $6.99), email a screenshot with proof of your purchasing date and we’ll email a promo code for the AUv3 feature (info@studiothezooo.com)\n\nGet New Path today to create a treasury of musical gems! \n\n* Runs on iPhone 5s with iOS 11.0 and above"

      "label": "XAir Monitor Mixer is a personal monitor mixer for select Behringer and Midas digital mixers. It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

      "label": "Verituner is an advanced piano tuning app for use by professional piano technicians. This new app brings our leading Verituner product line to the best ever platform in its 15 year history. \n\nPiano technicians have said that Verituner technology has given them better sounding tunings than they ever thought possible with the fewest steps.  Our patented multi-partial technology calculates your tuning to perfectly match each piano’s unique scaling. Automatic hands-off operation keeps you tuning quickly and eliminates tedious pre-tuning measurement steps. \n\nFEATURES\n• Aural Quality Tunings – create well-balanced tunings with the only tuning technology that tunes all the partials on all the notes.\n• Quick and Accurate Pitch Raises – get close quickly with overpull targets individually calculated from the starting pitch of each note.\n• Historical Temperaments – get access to over 90 of the best known historical temperaments, or easily key in your own custom temperaments.\n• Adjustable Stretch – precisely control octave widths with the built-in Styles, or create your own Custom Style to exactly match your aural tuning preferences.\n• Alternate Standard Pitch – tune to alternate pitches in a wide range of A=392 to A=466.\n• AutoNote – jump to any note and octave as you tune with automatic hands free tuning.\n• Saved Tunings - instantly recall prior tunings so you can tune quickly and consistently on frequently tuned pianos.\n\nHOW DOES VERITUNER WORK?\nVerituner measures the inharmonicity of every note while you are tuning, accumulating a detailed picture of the scaling of the entire piano. Then it calculates tuning targets for all the partials of all 88 notes to produce a well-balanced tuning custom fit to the piano. By tuning all the partials, the best possible compromise can be reached for every tuning interval, and the need for aural adjustments is substantially reduced.  All of this is done completely automatically while you tune – without any extra steps required. \n\nCAN I TUNE MY OWN PIANO?\nThe answer is yes!  BUT… Piano tuning involved advanced skills and experience. A beginner will be challenged with correctly interpreting the moving tuning displays, and performing very fine tuning pin movements that a professional takes years to perfect. If you are an amateur, please contact us to understand what to expect before purchasing this app.\n\nQUESTIONS AND SUPPORT\nIf you have any questions about the Verituner app or need any assistance whatsoever, please visit our website www.veritune.com and contact us by email or telephone. We are always happy to help!"

      "label": ">> Troublemaker requires iPad 4/Mini 2/iPhone 5S/iPod Touch 6 or higher <<\n\nFeatured in the US Appstore! Here's what the reviews say: \n\n\"Perfect for on the move acid sessions, the Trouble Maker app faithfully recreates the sound of the original TB-303\" - DJ Mag\n\n\"Troublemaker is absolutely no trouble at all to heartily recommend\" - SoundOnSound\n\n\"If you want to make the bassline from Josh Wink’s ‘Higher State of Consciousness’ on the bus, this is the app for the job\" - Factmag.com\n\n\"Top-notch stuff from a developer that just keeps getting better\" - Musicappblog.com\n\n\"This app has been consuming all of my time this week! Love it!\" - Discchord.com\n\nIntroducing Troublemaker: this is not a 303\n\nThe legendary TB-303 has magical properties; it is filled to the brim with analog shimmer. Its output jack is a gateway to a parallel universe and when you twiddle the filter knobs an army of highly trained pixies chisel the square waves from freshly harvested unicorn souls. So if you want a TB-303, you should buy a TB-303. But if you're after *that sound* Troublemaker will give you everything you need in spades.\n\nTroublemaker sports a carefully crafted diode filter emulation and among the available oscillators are the typical raspy, nasal sawtooth and rubbery squarewave with its oddball shape and shifting pulsewidth. \n\nIt also has the wow.\n\nTroublemaker is fully Audio Unit (AUv3) compatible, so you can go wild running multiple instances in your favorite DAWs. \n\nIt also has:\n- Ableton Link synchronization, \n-  MIDI CC controllers for all knobs (predefined), \n- Core Midi, Virtual Midi, Bluetooth Midi input, \n- MIDI Clock Sync, MIDI Start / Stop support\n- Realtime Mutation Probability Engine\n- Standalone sequencer supports 1-64 steps\n- Audiobus 3 support (audio + MIDI) \n- Exports MID and WAV files from the standalone sequencer\n- User manual and MIDI charts on ruismaker.com\n- Comes with an extra AUv3 plugin version of a modded Troublemaker unit\n\nAnd unlike the TB-303, it can actually sound like a bass guitar ;-)"

The E Theremin can achieve portamento, vibrato and quarter-tones with precise control.\n\n– Ideal for professionals looking for an alternative to the keyboard controlled synth. \n– Great for anyone interested in synthesizers, particularly early analogue.\n\nIn 1928 Maurice Martenot created one of the first electronic musical instruments, entitled; the Ondes-Martenot, the prerunner to the theremin, similar in sound but with a very different type of user interaction, an inspiring slider on a cord was used. Later in the 1950s Paul Tanner invented the Tannerin a.k.a. Electro Theremin. The Tannerin used the same slider controls as the Ondes-Martenot to control pitch. The Tannerin went on to play a large role in records such as The Beach Boys “Good Vibrations”. \n\nSummarized Features\n– Two oscillators\n– 5 waveforms\n– New classic style theremin waveform  \n– 4 octave scrolling keyboard\n– 4 octave slide control \n– Reverb with 11 presets\n– Delay (can preform endless loops)\n– Fat analogue sound\n– Retina GUI"

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store.

With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

Originally a collaboration of Wizdom Music's Jordan Rudess and Kevin Chartier (MorphWiz, SampleWiz) and Rob Fielding (Mugician), Geo Synthesizer is an incredibly expressive musical instrument specifically created for a multitouch surface. Jordan is now working with Roli-Labs, creators of the amazing Seaboard instrument on an exciting future for Geo Synthesizer and it's users!\n\nA comprehensive Geo Synthesizer manual is available at: http://www.wizdommusic.com/GeoSynth/manual.html\n\nJordan says: \"Since touching a preliminary piano keyboard on an iPhone screen and realizing the amazing potential for musical expression on a multitouch device, I have been inspired to create next-generation musical instruments for iOS. Geo Synthesizer is a dream come true in many ways. It is the fastest truly playable iOS instrument that I have put my hands on to date. I can fly through the range of an instrument while expanding on the kind of advanced pitch control we introduced in MorphWiz. As someone who grew up with synthesizers, I can tell you that pitch bending has never been this good!\n\n\"Geo features many of my custom sounds and in addition, Geo is also a MIDI controller, so you can use it with any external midi instrument or virtual MIDI.  Virtual MIDI allows you to control an app running in the background on the same device! Geo Synthesizer also now features AudioBus, a technology that allows one to interconnect audio apps in exciting new ways! A great feature of Geo is that internally and externally we send independent voices on each note played, so as an example, you can pitch bend one note and not the other, or add unique expression on every note! I can't wait to see the YouTube videos of all of you guys rocking out with Geo Synthesizer!!!\"\n\nFeatures:\n- AudioBus\n- ability to load waveforms from SampleWiz presets\n- octave rounding for effortless soloing over large ranges\n- whammy slider with absolute and relative modes\n- 12ET, 24ET, 53ET, and 665ET temperament options\n- mono, string, and full-polyphony modes\n- tuning and transposition controls\n- snap speed control to affect how quickly the instrument pulls notes in tune\n- playing surface options for number of rows and columns on screen\n- octave and fifth harmonics synthesis options to rich, organ-like sounds\n- gain control to add distortion to the sound\n- FM and touch FM controls for timbal variation\n- mono out for use with guitar amps\n- sine, sawtooth, square, and custom (SampleWiz) wave options\n- attack and release controls\n- synthesis body control\n- lowpass filter with resonance\n- stereo delay\n- reverb\n- MIDI output with polyphonic note bending and multiple configuration options to allow compatibility with a wide range of hardware and software synthesizers\n- performance menu lets you make your own custom menu so all the controls you need are always right at your fingertips\n- 40 presets carefully selected by Jordan Rudess, including patches from Jordan's personal sound library"

      "label": "Tempi measures you and your entire band’s tempo live, while you play, and lets you analyze the performance when you’re done. It's like a reverse metronome.\n\n* Tempi listens while you (or your entire band) play.\n* Tempi reports the BPM (beats per minute) of your performance in real time with remarkable accuracy.\n* When you’re done, Tempi lets you analyze the recording so that problem areas can be pinpointed and improved.\n* Use Tap for Tempo to quickly get a BPM reading at any time.\n* Switch themes for easy nighttime use or just to suit your style.\n* Export the audio recording of your performance to keep or share with others.\n\nHOW TO USE\n\nIn a band setting, place the iPhone or iPad in a position where the entire band can see it so everyone will know when the band is speeding up or slowing down. When you’re done playing the song, press the stop button to analyze the performance. You can scroll through the entire song, isolate where the tempo sped up or slowed down, and play back the song to get an idea of what went wrong.\n\nTempi is great for individual practice too. Use it instead of a metronome while practicing to pinpoint problem areas in a piece of music that you’re learning. If you can play through an entire song with the tempo only changing by 1 or 2 BPMs, you’ve arrived :-)\n\nTempi works best when there’s a distinct “pulse” to the song, like a kick drum/snare or a repeating chord, and assumes the player is trying to play at a consistent tempo. With less structured music it still does quite well but may occasionally report incorrect tempos.\n\nIf your song is very fast or very slow, tap the button at the top right to toggle between 1/2x, 1x, and 2x tempos."

      "label": "BLEASS Sidekick is a combination of a kick drum synth, a step sequencer, and a ducker (aka a sidechain compressor). The result is a plugin that provides a unique way to create exciting rhythmic dynamics within your music.\n\nThe kick drum synth uses an analogue-style engine inspired by vintage beatboxes, which allows it to create a wide range of classic analogue kick drum tones with ease. This synth can be triggered by the built-in 16-step sequencer or by an external MIDI input; its sound can be mixed with the audio passing through the plugin, be used to trigger the plugin’s ducker stage, or both. \n\nUsed without the ducker, BLEASS Sidechain makes it easy to add your own kick parts to loops and other percussive parts. \n\nBringing in the ducker causes the input signal to reduce in volume whenever the kick synth is triggered. When used on a drum loop this lets you impose your own creativity on the underlying feel and beat of the loop, ducking-out the loop’s kick sound and pattern so that you can replace them with a sound and pattern that you have crafted.\n\nPerhaps BLEASS Sidekick’s best trick, though, is to use the kick synth and sequencer purely as a trigger for the ducker. This lets you create fascinating and detailed dynamic rhythms within any part or track, whether individual instrument or an entire mix. \n\nThis plugin is AUv3 compatible and offers Multi-Bus output (within AUM) as well as Midi Input.\n\nMore information and tutorials available on https://www.bleass.com/sidekick"

      "label": "From the early 1920s, jazz musicians attempted to make their improvised lines flow more smoothly by connecting scales and scale tones through the use of chromatic passing tones. During that period of time such jazz giants as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Wes Montgomery, Bud Powell, Charles Mingus began adding an extra half step to the different scales and the modes derived from it (i.e., dorian mixolydian, and locrian). This technique has the effect of making the scales rhythmically symmetrical when played in eighth notes, as most lines were at the time. For instance, a major scale played in eighth notes with the extra half step added. This material is widely used not only by bass guitarists, but also by double bassists.\n\nBebop scales is a serious material for improvisations. They are especially good in building WALKING BASS LINES in jazz. You can also see and hear the harmony over which Bebop scale is played. This is who does it well: Jeff Berlin, Richard Bona, Ray Brown, Ron Carter, Stanley Clarke, Nathan East, Matthew Garrison, Eddie Gomez, Charlie Haden, Dave Holland, Anthony Jackson, Alphonso Johnson, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Gary Peacock, Miroslav Vitous.\n\nThe \"Bebop Scales on Bass\" is the one app that represent a big number of bebop scales in a very simple and visual way on your iPhone / iPad. \n\nApp Features: \n------------------------ \n● About 370 of different Bass Bebop Scales, which can be easily transposed, resulting in more than 4,400 of total Scales (incl. variations and transposition)! \n● Harmonization feature of every Scale: you can listen to the chords, over which given Scales can be played. More information about these chords you can find in our \"Bassman\" app. This is a common technique used by arrangers to harmonize melodic lines. \n● Every scale is represented in several fingering layouts, vertical and horizontal, narrow or wide, at your taste! You can switch between them by tapping the \"Variation\" button! \n● Transpose scales into any desired key by dragging notes on the screen with your finger! \n● Metronome with adjustable tempo and time signature for training \n● Cursor can display note names or fingering (selectable) \n● Notes can display note names or fingering (selectable) \n● Degree indicator. It allows you to examine scale steps in detail. (Degree on/off toggle is located at the bottom of the Settings page) \n● Sharp and flat signatures correspond to the current Scale's key \n● Fast cycled playback with adjustable tempo (30 - 360 BPM) \n● Step by step note playback in both directions for detailed learning of Scales \n● Manual note selection by tapping notes on the screen \n● Six selectable harmony timbres to choose from \n● Stereo Chorus FX for harmony chords at your choice \n● Favorites button (a Star) to mark your favorite modes. After, you can access them all from \"Favorites\" folder in the Scales Selector. \n● Master Tune parameter to use with bass guitars with different tunings \n● designed for both iPhone and iPad\n\n● iOS 7.0 and up compatible (incl. iOS 11)"

      "label": "SENODE is an innovative music app based on the idea of finite state machines. It works like a polyphonic modular step sequencer with probabilistic steps. This app is perfect for generative music and complex sequencing setups. Senode syncronizes its clock to Ableton Link or integrates as AUv3 plugin. All actions are MIDI bindable, so the steps can be triggered in real time from drum pads, sensors or other apps – a real live-performance instrument!\n\n\"Senode is something quite different when it comes to sequencing\" - Create Digital Music\n\n\"I highly recommend Senode to everyone who is interested in generative music. It's such a fun app to work with!\" - haQ attaQ\n\n\"A Killer App!\" - A4iRebirth\n\n\nCREATE COMPLEX SEQUENCES WITH RANDOMIZATION\n\nThe core of Senode is a graph of nodes connected by edges. You decide if Senode acts like a simple vending machine or a complex pinball game. Each node triggers a sound when activated, while edges determine the direction of travel. Instruments are controlled by emitters which send their tokens onto the graph and generate MIDI signals. That means, you can compose a generative music piece for a whole orchestra using the graph notation and a couple of emitters! It gets more interesting if you add random directions or emit multiple tokens at different time positions.\n\n\nGRAPHICAL MULTI-TOUCH INTERFACE\n\nCompose and perform your music live using the intuitive multi-touch interface. Create, drag and connect nodes with multiple fingers. The on-screen keyboard helps you to visualize and edit notes easily.\n\n\nINTEGRATED SYNTHESIZER \n\nThe standalone app contains a simple but powerful subtractive synthesizer with main OSC (sine, saw, square, noise), sub OSC (sine), 1-pole lowpass filter, stereo reverb and ADSR envelope. Try the demo patches to get inspired!\n\n\nMIDI CONTROL AND STEP RECORDING\n\nUse the step record function to create new nodes on the fly, from single notes or using the chord detection. Use a drum kit, wearable sensors or any other MIDI device to control the steps of Senode. Enjoy the unique experience of being your own clock!\n\n\nCONTROL MUSIC APPS AND EXTERNAL DEVICES\n\nSenode is the perfect sequencer for all MIDI-capable apps. Play in sync with other apps using Ableton Link. Integrate with your favourite DAW using the AUv3 plugin (in-app purchase required). If you connect a MIDI interface, you can even control your hardware synths with the app.\n\n\nREALTIME CONTROL\n\nSenode is made for live music performance. There are no default \"beats\" or \"bars\" and all actions are performed in real time. Tokens can be quantized to a clock (16th resolution) and support catch-up, which means you can hit all functions like a drummer \"on the spot\" and stay in sync, even if you're too early or a little late. By the way, the really cool stuff will happen if you break free from 4/4 bar schemes, start your sequences on off-beat timings or create crazy polyrhythmic cycles...\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n- innovative non-linear graphical sequencer with draggable multi-touch interface\n- standalone app and AUv3 MIDI plugin (in-app purchase required) for iPad and iPhone\n- unlimited notes or chords per step with velocity, legato or fixed-length notes\n- unlimited number of steps and directions: cycles, randomized, one-shot\n- multi-timbral patches with polyphonic emitters\n- live arpeggiator mode with hold and monophonic option\n- integrated polysynth with sine, square, saw and noise OSC, ADSR, filter, reverb\n- real-time sequencer control with clock sync and catch-up quantization\n- MIDI device input and output\n- velocity-sensitive binding support for all sequencer operations like step, emit, tick, trigger or clear\n- tempo and start/stop synchronization using Ableton Link\n- step recording with chord detection\n- copy and paste functionality\n- transpose and clock divide functions\n- comes with tutorial and example patches that you can instantly play\n\nSee senode.org for more details."

The playful touch UI invites anything from live performance, experimentation to learning and mastering the granular concept.\n\nMultiple plugins: Import, Record or Live Process\nYou can import your own WAVs (standalone & AUv3 Instrument plugin), Record audio (Record effect plugin) or live-process sound (Process effect plugin) to create anything from drones and granular echoes to moving microtonal audio textures.\n\nDesigned for touch: Kinetic Sliders\nAll sliders and XY pads are linked to a physics model which lets you flick and throw them around. Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

      "label": "Finally there is an improved controller App for Sonos available on your iPhone or iPod Touch! Even still supporting iPod Touch 5th Gen and iPhone 4S! \n\nWatch on YouTube (http://youtu.be/rvp4QinakL0) or \nread below about\n \n- a new intuitive and concise user interface\n- less taps for common tasks\n- home automation integration\n- and current limitions (don't skip them ;) )\n\nor come over to my homepage www.sonophone.net with much more information and screenshots available.\n\nThis application is not endorsed by or associated with Sonos, Inc. (which is why it is not free)\n\n◆◆◆ a new intuitiv and concise user interface ◆◆◆\nSonoPhone is designed to leverage the latest iOS design principles:\n- Tap or drag the player on the top and you'll find the players view to select a new player and with volume controls for all players. From here you can also enter Zone Management, where you can group and ungroup players with drag and drop.\n- Tap or drag the Track infos on the bottom and you'll be at the big covers screen\n- Drag the main menu from any place to the left or right to have instant access to playlist or shortcuts\n- volume + progress popups: when changing volume or progress of a song, you get popups telling you the actual values. Stop guessing your desired values today!\n\n◆◆◆ less taps for common tasks ◆◆◆\nSonoPad tries to optimize most often used tasks to have the least taps needed. In the end you are able to navigate and control your players much more fluently.\n\n- Touch To Play: are you sick of always beeing asked what to do when you tap a track or album? SonoPhone defaults to just starting an album or song. A long press still gives you access to all options - you can also change the tap default in the settings menu. Want to build a playlist fast? Just set the default to 'always add to end' and off you go ...\n- tap an album cover image and the whole album starts to play immediately \n- aggregated search: search results are collapsed into one view, so you see immediately in what category you have the best results, without switching back and forth\n- shortcuts to most used functions: drag the main menu to the right to get shortcut buttons for artist, albums, radio and musicservices.\n- you can control the volume of every player directly from the player selection screen. No need to switch players anymore.\n\n◆◆◆ home automation integration ◆◆◆\n- you can start SonoPhone with the 'sonophone://' URL from other remote Apps. Its also possible to hand over a return URL, then a new icon is displayed to return to the automation App.\nFurther option include to select a default player or default menu, you can read more about all option on my homepage sonophone.net\n\n◆◆◆ Limitations ◆◆◆\n\n- all music services except Google Music are supported\n- no playing of music stored on iPhone yet\n- no options to set alarms or sleep settings\n- no support for discontinued WD100 dock\n\n◆◆◆ Other stuff ◆◆◆\n- Sonos is registered trademark of Sonos, Inc."

You can even view a device’s screen* to follow along as they play! Cue works with forScore 6.1 or later (sold separately).\n\nWith Dual Page mode, you can use forScore on one device and Cue on another device to display two full-sized pages simultaneously. Your page and its annotations are sent wirelessly, and tapping or swiping on either device turns two pages at a time—just like a book. Dual Page mode even supports links and buttons, so you can tap on them no matter which side they’re on and they’ll work just like you expect. Visit forScore.co/cue to learn more!\n\n*Performance can vary greatly based on settings, environmental factors, and network availability. A wi-fi connection is strongly recommended.

You can use it in individual lessons, home study, or in group classes with the built-in games or with games led by you. Because you know how you want to teach or how your students learn best, you can tailor the app to exactly what you want: \n\n• You define the notes on the grand staff that you want your student to drill. \n• You decide if the application should test or teach. \n• You decide how many cards to drill, how long to test, and how quickly students must answer. \n• You decide whether to drill in letter names, solfège, piano keyboard, and several other options.\n• You can review the incorrect notes and save them for student drilling. \n\nMusic Flash Class is designed for use with all ages: \n\n• You can lock the device’s orientation to accommodate each student’s way of holding the device. \n• You can discourage accidental disruption of the games by 'locking' buttons that would normally exit the play. \n• You can use built in games or design challenges for your students. \n\n\"I love the app....my students are competing against each other for time and decks completed without error!!!\" - Penny L., professional piano teacher \n\n\"This app has become a favorite backseat activity in my van.

      "label": "If you think FM Synthesis is complicated, it’s time to think again!\n\nBLEASS Omega places all of the sparkle, character, nuance and dynamic expressiveness of FM Synthesis at your fingertips, and does away with the arcane programming interfaces so often associated with FM. Harnessing BLEASS’ signature GUI technology, creating and crafting sounds in Omega is not just easier than with other FM synths, it’s easy – PERIOD!\n\nAll of the classic capabilities of FM Synthesis are available in BLEASS Omega – expressive electric pianos, deep thundering basses, crystal-clear pads, sparkling bells, and soulful leads. And thanks to the instrument’s analogue-style Waveshaper and multi-mode Filter, BLEASS Omega can inject powerful analogue-like flavour into those pure FM tones, giving searing filter sweeps, growling distortions, and harmonically-rich resonances.\n\nThe four FM operators that sit at the heart of BLEASS Omega are edited simultaneously from within a single screen, with all operator envelopes and controls available to the touch of your finger. This amazingly user-friendly approach makes light work of sound editing, and encourages experimentation and exploration in a way no other FM synth can achieve. \n\nWith eleven FM algorithms on offer, each providing a different way of interconnecting the four operators for radically different results, the sonic scope of BLEASS Omega is vast. The included library of over 200 professionally designed presets makes full use of this versatility, furnishing you with a varied and inspirational sound palette to use in your music making and sound design projects.\n\nBLEASS Omega fits in with your workflow and studio setup, no matter how you like to create. The iOS edition provides both standalone and AUv3 versions for use on iPad and iPhone, whilst the desktop edition for Windows and macOS comes as a VST3/AU plugin instrument, compatible with all major DAWs.\n\nMore information, tutorials and specifications on https://www.bleass.com/omega/"

      "label": "Description – Hip Licks for Saxophone Application\n \nHip Licks for Saxophone is designed to help saxophonists develop fluency in the jazz language by providing mainstream jazz vocabulary (swing/bop/post-bop) that nails the changes and lays great on the horn.\n \nThink of Hip Licks for Saxophone as a musical reference application, like a dictionary of great licks in all twelve keys, available when you need it. You can open the application to any page and just start playing.\n \nNeed something that will help you sound like a total pro while playing over the most challenging keys and chord progressions? Hip Licks for Saxophone is an indispensable resource that can immediately show\nyou how a professional player would approach those tough keys and chord progressions.\n \nCustom User Interface\n \nThis application features a customized user interface that makes this application fun and easy to use. When you launch the application, you’ll see a menu window that lets you choose to read through the entire contents of Hip Licks, page by page without the play-along tracks, or to load each set of licks with the accompanying play-along track. All page turns are automatic, and synchronized with the play-along track. \n\nTo start playing a sax demo track, simply click on the saxophone icon on the lower left side of the display, and the track will immediately begin to play.\n \nTo start playing a rhythm-section-only track, simply click on the drum icon on the lower right side of the display, and the track will immediately begin to play.\n \nSpecial Features of Hip Licks for Saxophone by Greg Fishman:\n \n• 168 Hip Licks – Each lick is unique and customized for each key, based on the best timbre, register and playability on the horn. The C7 lick is different than the B7 lick, which is different than the Bb7 lick, etc.\n \n• All fast tempo licks include both Slow Tempo and Fast Tempo Play-Along Tracks.\n \n• Hip Licks Nail the Most Popular Chord Progressions:\n \n– Major 7th, Dominant 7th, Dominant 7b9, Minor 7th, Minor 7b5, and Diminished 7th and Augmented 7th Chords\n– ii-7 / V7 / I Major (two and four-measure phrases)\n– ii-7b5 / V7b9 / i Minor (two and four-measure phrases)\n– Parallel Major to Minor Progressions\n– ii- ii-Maj7 / ii-7 V7 / I Maj7 (ii-7 / V7 / I Maj7 w/moving 7ths)\n \n• Interactive Call and Response Format, perfect for ear-training and developing your musical memory. Each lick is played twice in a row on the Play-Along Tracks, so you can hear the lick and then immediately play along.\n \n• Twelve Key Approach – Every track takes you through all twelve keys.\n \n• Rhythm-Section-Only Tracks let you experiment with your own variations on the licks and improvise over a wide variety of harmonic settings. These tracks are also excellent backgrounds for practicing all of your chords and scales.\n \n• Technique Builder – Use Hip Licks for Saxophone as part of your daily practice routine to dramatically increase your technical command of the saxophone.\n\nIf you have any other issues/problems with the app, please contact me at greg@gregfishmanjazzstudios.com or call 847-334-3634. All of my books and apps are 100% guaranteed!"

Anyone can jump in and play with over 160 included presets or lay fingers to the controls and begin exploring vast magical realms of creative potential for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and Mac. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App incorporates a number of inspiring sound creation tools and capabilities not present on its analog antecedent. New functions include the ability to play chords with up to four-note polyphony, an easy-to-use arpeggiator for rhythmic pattern creation, a real time looping recorder with unlimited overdubbing capacity, a tempo-synchronizable stereo ping pong delay module, and the Bender -- a wide-range stereo time modulation effect module. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App also supports AUv3 Audio Unit extensions, which allows multiple instances of this powerful instrument to be used simultaneously within compatible iOS apps supporting AUv3.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY \nIntroduced by Moog in 1970, the Minimoog Model D served as the archetype for all electronic keyboards that followed. It gave users the ability to design their own sounds, translating imagination into reality. The Minimoog’s portability, affordability and accessibility made it the go-to instrument for musicians looking to expand beyond the traditional sounds of the time. Bernie Worrell used the Minimoog Model D to establish Parliament Funkadelic’s futuristic funk sound. Kraftwerk employed the Minimoog Model D on the successful concept album Autobahn, sparking an entirely new genre. Gary Numan replaced his live band’s guitars with Minimoog Model Ds, creating the prototype for industrial music. The classic sound of the Minimoog Model D can be heard on Bob Marley’s Catch A Fire, Michael Jackson’s Thriller and Dr. Dre’s The Chronic; Detailed in the mini-doc series “A Brief History Of The Minimoog”. \n\nFEATURES \n• Ships with over 160 presets (hundreds more available in the Minimoog Model D App Store) \n• Up to 4-notes of polyphony \n• Easily share presets and audio recordings with friends \n• Arpeggiator module with note-hold and chord latch capability \n• Stereo ping-pong delay effect \n• Bender time modulation effect \n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing \n• Selectable envelope shapes and triggering behavior \n• Effortless MIDI CC mapping \n• Seamlessly backup presets to iCloud \n• Play mode for easier panel and keyboard interaction \n• A new take on the classic feedback/overload path \n\nSUPPORTS\n• All 64-bit iOS devices\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions (Including GarageBand)\n• MPE Controller Support \n• Ableton Link \n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI \n• MIDI Program Change Support \n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers \n• Share over AirDrop, Mail, or other iOS applications"

Create a new Alarm.\n2. Choose either one song or create a playlist of songs to shuffle.\n3. Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

The signals are easy to understand and the conductor can use them to adjust the musical expression within every desired musical parameter. Through the development of VOPA, as a pedagogical tool and an artistic methodology, the signals have shown to be surprisingly effective as an easy and fast way to create “music of the moment” with singers of all levels, from audience participation to the highest professional level of vocal arts."

      "label": "This app is a speaker polarity tester. Find out if your speakers are wired correctly (in phase or out of phase). Test your surround speakers, stereo speakers, PA speakers, in fact any speaker with wiring terminals on the back.\n\nThis speaker polarity tester was designed by the same people who built the Audio Toolbox, and the polarity tester in that unit was known as the most accurate and reliable polarity tester available. Now that technology is available in your iPhone. \n\nUse this app to test your home speakers, recording studio monitors, or as part of your professional contractor work. Speakers wired backwards are the most common error in sound system setup, cause big problems, and are easily corrected. This app will give you the answers, no matter how difficult the wiring may be to trace. \n\nSpeaker Pop works by watching for a proprietary \"pop\" sound from the speaker, and doing DSP analysis of the sound to determine if the speaker cone is moving in the correct direction.\n\nAs long as you use a standard 1/8\" stereo plug, you can use any normal 1/8\" to RCA adapter to get the signal into your system. You can also to record the \"pop\" test signal to a CD, DVD, or another iPod, and play this signal through your speakers. \n\nWorks with iAudioInterface and iTestMic.\n\nSelect the speaker type filter, Woofer, Midrange, or Tweeter. This selects either a 125Hz, 500-2000Hz, or 8000Hz filter, to make the readings more reliable.\n\nOnce you have the test signal coming out of the speaker, position your phone near the speaker (we suggest you flip it over to point the internal mic directly at the speaker -- the display will flip). In a few seconds you will get the reading on the screen, either a Plus or a Minus. Plus indicates correct speaker polarity, Minus means you need to swap the wires coming into the speaker.\n\nWe also have stereo and surround test signals available for download from our web site which are ready for burning to CD or DVD. See our web site or for more information. Note that iDVD will not burn encoded surround files, a more advanced DVD burning authoring program is required. Some folks have had success with Toast. We also sell test DVDs on our web site.\n\nSee our other audio apps: AudioTools, our premier audio and acoustics test and analysis app, SPL, the professional grade sound level meter for the iPhone, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real time analyzer, FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the Energy Time Curve app, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time analysis, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator. Watch for more coming soon."

      "label": "hearEQ builds your EQ skills to professional levels using custom ear training exercises, created just for you from your favorite songs. Simple, powerful, and fast, hearEQ is perfect for ear training on the go. Named one of \"The best iPhone and iPad apps for musicians\" (www.apppicker.com), here's what the experts have to say about hearEQ:\n\n\"When I found hearEQ, I knew this was a game-changer. From the ease of use and the ability to use your own music selections, hearEQ is perfectly designed to be the go-to choice for developing your ear. My students have shown tremendous improvements in mixing and productions, and I completely attribute this to hearEQ. Thanks Ten Kettles! Keep up the great work. You are making a difference!\" -Chandler Bridges, Ph.D., Professor (The Los Angeles Film School); Audio engineer (Will Smith, Aaliyah, Johnny Mathis, P-Diddy, J-Lo, Bette Midler, LeAnn Rimes, and more) with two Grammy-winning albums.\n\n“After half an hour with the app I had a noticeable improvement to my score, but I was also thinking in much clearer terms too!” -Tim Webb, www.discchord.com\n\n“This handy app is one of the greatest tools I've seen for helping you hear exactly how EQ adjustments affect your sound. Wish I would have had this when I was first learning how to mix live sound.” -James Wasem, www.greatchurchsound.com\n\n\"hearEQ…makes the experience of ear training enjoyable enough to seem like fun.  [It's] a great educational tool.\" -Tom Flint, Sound on Sound: The World's Best Recording Technology Magazine\n\n“The principle behind hearEQ is beautifully straightforward…even with a little repetition, things do start to improve and I suspect if you were to build some hearEQ into your daily musical routine, you would soon reap some positive benefits.” -John Walden, www.musicappblog.com\n\n----------------------------------\n\nEvery frequency range has a color, a quality, a character. For sound engineers, musicians, and other enthusiasts, knowing how to apply this to an equalizer (EQ) can make a transformational change to your sound—whether you're mixing a live concert, a recording, or even playing music through iTunes.  (VIDEO @ www.hearEQ.com)\n\nIt's a simple app with a powerful promise:  if you learn the qualities of each frequency band—for example, cutting 4kHz puts sound in the background—then you can make equalization work for you, and truly transform your sound into something professional and beautiful. \n\nhearEQ uses your favorite songs on your device to create custom ear training exercises that a) teach you all about frequency bands, and b) help you really hone your EQ skills. A standard 10-band or 30-band* equalizer is used, just like you'd find in iTunes and on many professional sound mixers. Your song will be played back with a simple equalization applied—and you guess what it was! \n\n> Was it really clear, maybe a bit hollow? Could be a 1000 Hz cut. \n\n> Was it muddy? Maybe that's a 500 Hz boost. \n\n> Was it really present, almost too in-your-face? Sounds like a 4kHz boost. \n\nTen questions, ten frequencies, and then you get a score. Want to focus on just a few frequency bands to start? You can do that too. Keep at it, and you'll be an EQ master in no time.\n\nWant to learn more? Check out our site and the hearEQ video at www.hearEQ.com.\n\n\n*The 30-band equalizer is part of the \"Advanced EQ\" module, available as an in-app purchase within hearEQ.\n\nNOTE:  hearEQ works with any track on your device, with the exception of tracks that prevent our EQ processing, such as DRM-protected tracks and cloud tracks (e.g., Apple Music). That said, hearEQ ships with several built-in practice tracks, so you'll be able to start EQing right away!\n\nTERMS OF USE:  https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

It uses Apple's accelerate framework to perform fast high resolution 8K fast fourier transformations to display a real time frequency spectrum. The result is an accurate representation of the sampled sound broken down into its frequency components. \n\nYou can use this plugin in conjunction with equalisers and parametric filters to obtain a nice flat mix or eliminate hard to find unwanted noise or hiss.\n\nVarious display modes include, linear narrow band, logarithmic narrow band, Octave, 1/3 Octave, 1/6 Octave and Mixer Mode with selectable ANSI A and C weighting curves. Up to 64 times oversampling can be applied to obtain more stable readings.\n\nThis plugin also includes a Digital Tuner mode which allows real time note detection, frequency and cents deviation from true pitch.\n\nThis is one of a suite of AUv3 compatible plugins which will also soon be available from 4Pockets."

Big buttons designed for live play-ability and simple design for the zero learning curve. Open with Audiobus play along with other apps and record. The difference between a beat machine and a drum machine is this app loops quality drums recorded by a professional drummer in a studio when drum machines just play single sounds and are computerized, complicated, and lack feel and musicality. For less than a dollar have a beat machine in your pocket with HQ drum loops with natural drum loops in a highly organized structure.\n\nThis is a beat machine, a drum machine plays individual sounds that you have to sequence together. I did the hard part so you can focus on making music.\n\nI am an indie developer, I don't have a million-dollar ad campaign.

      "label": "Euclidean Sequencer is an alternative incarnation of the classic step sequencer that has become very popular in the modular realm. It is based on Euclidean rhythms developed by computer scientist Godfried Toussaint in 2004. Euclidean rhythms have their roots in Greek mathematician Euclid’s algorithm, which involves using the greatest common divisor of two numbers to place hits in a sequence as evenly as possible across a set timing divisions.\n\nIn practice this is actually simpler than you might think, and Euclidean Sequencer is a great way to auto generate complex musical sequences with no prior knowledge of how it actually works.\n\nEuclidean Sequencer is an AUv3 plugin that can be loaded inside any popular host application that has flexible MIDI routing. \n\nYou can define up to 4 Euclidean rhythm parts, each part is referred to as a band. The bands are labelled A-D and colour coded RED, ORANGE, GREEN and CYAN. Together these 4 bands create a pattern, and you can create up to 16 seperate patterns per song patch.\n\nSince each band can specify its own note sequence and output MIDI channel, you can create some quite sophisticated rythms patterns, driving 4 seperate instruments at once. Even better you can seamlessly switch patterns to create even longer evolving sequences. Patterns follow a specified key, scale, or defined chord.\n\nYou can even use MIDI input to automatically make note sequences conform to the currently playing chords.\n\nPlease note: This is an AUv3 plugin instended to be used inside your favourite host DAW such as AUM, Cubasis, Loopy Pro etc. It will work with any app that has flexible MIDI routing.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n4 Band Sequencer\n16 Patterns per patch.\nUp to 64 events per band.\nSeamless pattern transitions.\nOutput Port and Channel control.\nPer Band and Global speeds.\nRandomize function with varying complexity.\nSupports note Probability.\nReverse and PingPong modes.\nMIDI Chord recognition.\nLatch mode.\n4 Band Velocity Mixer\nController support.\nGate Mode.\nAUv3 Compatible."

      "label": "The VTines instrument is based on real samples of a 1978 Fender Rhodes© Mark1 fully restored with clean pickups and tines, new grommets, new hammer tips, etc, so it is the best an electric piano can sound. Our model gives you access to a 100% continuous response, a very small sized library (90Mb), common FX and adjustable bell and release volumes. It also ensures that the staccatos and releases that make up for half of the realism sound perfect, not like a fadeout, not too loud, just perfect.\n\nThe second concentric knobs control Treble and Bass, just like on a real suitcase Rhodes. We measured this carefully and made sure the ranges and frequencies matched the original.\nThe vibrato has two controls, the depth and the speed. We carefully measured the output of the preamp and copied the real output of each channel. We also added a tempo link as it can be very useful. We also extended the original range as this is a common mod on real Rhodes.\nWe measured the output of the preamp of a Rhodes© suitcase and created an exact replica of the stereo panning of the Vibrato. We just added the possibility to sync it to your tempo and also extended the speed range just like some real mods do.\nThere are two very common FX accessible on the front panel: reverb and drive. You can also engage the AMP simulation from the front panel.\n\nThe VTines combines samples and modeling techniques to accurately reproduce the sound of the original instrument. This allows the VTines to weight only 90Mb, to really sound like a Fender Rhodes with all of its imperfections and to have a fully continuous response.\n\nThe « Live » version of our instruments has been especially thought for Live performance usage. CPU and RAM footprints have been optimized, so that our model can run on IOS devices. We paid a particular attention to making it easy to connect and use with external MIDI keyboards, and/or within you favorite AUv3 host\n\n- Sampling and modeling hybrid of a Mark1 Fender Rhodes©\n- Full continuous velocity\n- Perfect staccatos and release samples\n- 7 high quality presets\n- Bass and treble EQ adjusted to the frequencies and ranges of the original preamp\n- Precise modeling of the original Vibrato effect (can be synched to the host tempo)\n- Very detailed Rhodes© AMP simulation\n- Reverberation and Drive FX\n- Adjustable pedal volume, release volume and bell amount\n- Adjustable MIDI response, input sources and channels\n- Adjustable MIDI CCs to control knobs and switches\n- Standalone app and AUv3 plug-in\n- Low download and installation size (less than 90 Mb)\n- Reasonably low RAM and CPU footprint"

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Live pitch graph displays the exact pitch, note and deviation in realtime.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to visualize pitch on piano keys.\r\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

It can be set to different time signatures like 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 7/4, 9/4, 11/4, 13/4. You can also select or deselect the downbeats and offbeats separately.\nYou can listen and play to all chords in all twelve keys, see which notes are the chord notes and scale notes and read information about the chord and the corresponding scale.\nIn addition to that, all chords can also be played randomly. You can choose to just randomly change the root or the root and the chord type.\nThe app lets you filter the chords, which allows you to only randomly play the chords of for example the modes of melodic minor or harmonic minor.\n45+ Chords:\n▵7, 7, -7, ø7, o7, 5\n69, ▵7#11, ▵7#5, ▵7#5(11), ▵7#9, ▵7#9b13\n7sus4, 7susb9, 7#11, 7#5, 7b913, 7b9b13, 7b13, 7alt\n-6, -▵7, -▵7b13, -7b13, -7b9, -7#11, -∆7#11, phryg, ø713, o7b2b11\nmajor, major/3, major/5, major/b9, major/9, major/b3, major/11, major/#11, major/b13, major/13, major/7, major/▵7\nminor, minor/b3, minor/5\naugmented, diminished\nSounds: electric piano, piano, organ and strings\n\n•Progressions•\n\nIn this section you can practice more than 50 chord progressions in all twelve keys.\nThe metronome, with all its setting options, is also included in this section.\nThe volume of the root note, third and septime or rather the tensions is adjustable.\nIf you press one of the two random buttons, the app picks a random root or a random progression and root.\n50+ progressions:\nII-7 V7 I▵7, II-7 V7alt I▵7, II-7 bII7#11 I▵7, II-7 V7b913 I▵7, II-7 V7b9b13 I▵7, II-7 V7susb9 I▵7\nIIø7 V7 I-, Coltrane Changes and so on…see full list on my website.\nSounds: electric piano, piano, organ and strings\n\n•Pad•\n\nUsing the pad you can put together your own intervals and chords.\nYou have four octaves and five sounds to choose from, with which you can select up to five tones. The tones can sound both simultaneously and one after the other.\nThe metronome, with all its setting options, is also included in this section.\nYou can choose out of these sounds:\nelectric piano, piano, organ, strings and sine\n\n•Fingerings for saxophone and reed adjustment for saxophone and clarinet•\n\nThere are fingering charts about standard fingerings, false fingerings, altissimo and quarter tones and information about reed adjustment of sides, table, tip, shoulder and heart.\nIf you don´t play the saxophone, you can hide this part of the app.\n\n•Features•\n\n* Stealth Mode (Ear Training Mode). You can use stealth mode in drones, chords and progressions. This will hide the currently played chords and display them afterwards.\n* A practice timer that informs you when your set practice time has expired.\n* Landscape mode.\n* Light- and dark appearance (Night Shift).\n* You can set if you play a C, Bb, oder Eb Instrument.\n* Are you an advanced player? The expert mode offers you additional information which could be confusing to unexperienced musicians. If you have no idea what C▵7#5 means or if you have never heard of quarter tones you probably should choose the standard mode.\n* All sounds can be played from 432Hz to 444Hz."

      "label": "Simple 12-string guitar tuner to tune up your 12-string guitar. This is for the standard eEaAdDgGBBEE 12 String Guitar tuning.\n\nTuning your guitar can be a difficult task for you if you are just beginning guitar. The good news is, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. A nicely tuned guitar can make your music sound a lot better and help you greatly while you're are just getting the hang of finger placement for notes.\n\nA 12 string guitar is split up into 6 pairs of 2 strings. The thicker string of the pair is tuned to the same note and octave as a regular 6 string guitar. The thinner string, on the pair of strings 3-6, is tuned one octave higher than it's pair. On the first and second pairs, the notes are the same octave and each string in the pair should sound exactly the same to it's other string in the pair. This is eEaAdDgGBBEE tuning. The lowercase letters means that it is one octave higher then it's counterpart. \n\nTouch the note for the string you want to tune and then turn the tuning pegs on your guitar and match it up with the note that is being played.\n\nTip: Make several passes tuning each of the strings. For example you might have noticed that if you have tuned all the strings once, and then back to the first one you tuned, it might be off a little bit. This is because you are increasing or decreasing the tension on each of the strings as you tune it and the instrument's body might bend ever so slightly due to this difference in tension. This causes the other strings to slightly change in pitch. So make sure you keep on checking and tuning the strings until all are in tune, so make several passes.\n\nAlso you can use this simple tuner for your standard 6-String Guitar, it is the same tuning, only the strings on the 6-String Guitar are EADGBBEE, which is right part of this 12-String Guitar Tuner. So use just right part of this tuner to tune up your 6-String Guitar.\n\nAny questions using the App? Write support@tuneinstrument.com and we we'll get back to you promptly.\n\nIf you need to tune other music instruments simply have a look into our other applications: Violin Tuner Simple, Cello Tuner Simple, Banjo Tuner Simple, Mandolin Tuner Simple, Double Bass Tuner Simple, Viola Tuner Simple, Guitar Tuner Simple, Ukulele Tuner Simple, Bass Tuner Simple.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @TuneInstrument\nLike us on Facebook: facebook.com/Tuneinstrument\nFollow us on Google+: Tuneinstrument\nSubscribe to YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/TuneInstrument\nSign up for newsletter and or visit us: www.tuneinstrument.com"

The idea was to design a tool to manipulate a melody’s speed, direction, and pitch, as well as play multiple variations of the melody simultaneously.\n\nAs it turned out, the best implementation for this was to reimagine one of the most fundamental building blocks of all music sequencers: the piano roll.\n\nFUGUE MACHINE is the world’s first multi-playhead piano roll. Create a music sequence and play it back with up to four playheads at once — each at various speeds, directions, pitches, and more. Watch the playheads dance, and hear the complex patterns that emerge.\n\nIt’s mesmerizing.\n\nFugue Machine supports iPhone, iPad, MIDI, AUv3 MIDI, Ableton Link, Audiobus, Audiobus 3 MIDI, and Inter-App Audio."

Get creative and listen to how your compositions swing with the Genius Jamtracks trio.\n- Edit the charts for your favourite jazz standards however you like.\n\n\n“Genius Jamtracks is easily the best play along app out there! Particularly the piano voicings are more logical and realistic than other play-along apps. The bass and drums are not just a simple repetitive pattern, but actually use some jazz language. And it’s nice that you can make the band busy in unpredictable ways. As much like playing with a real group as you can get from an algorithm. Highly recommended!“\nPaul Bollenback  \n\n“It’s like a jazz musician wrote it. The drums and piano are just like how a jazz drummer and pianist would play. Couldn’t be an easy task to create that!”\nSteve Beskrone\n\n\n\n- Easy to read charts! \nCustom fonts make for beautiful, easy to read chord charts.\n\n- Rhythmic Complexity slider \nStart with simple comping and work your way up to mastering superhuman polyrhythms!\n\n- Harmonic Complexity slider\nStart with triads and work your way up to advanced substitutions and reharmonisation of the song.\n\n- The one and only polyrhythmic play-along!\nIn the Jam Session mode, the app decides on its own what to play and when to play it, based on the style of the song and the tempo. Experiment with how the app transforms the rhythm and the harmony according to the slider levels.\n\n- Master your polyrhythms!\nFocus on a specific grouping, polyrhythm or rhythmic displacement. Ask the trio – or an individual instrument – to include only what you’ve requested when they introduce polyrhythmic phrasing.\nAs you won’t know when or how it will be used though, this feature also helps sharpen your ability to improvise as well as mastering that rhythm!\n\n- Why it sounds great.\nIt’s all in the dynamics, note durations, space and feel. The Genius Jamtracks trio pays close attention to each of these elements to make the Genius Jam Session experience as close to the real thing as possible.\n\n- A real swing feel!\nForget the robotic triplets of other play-alongs. When changing the tempo, the app doesn’t simply play faster or slower, the swing feel changes as well. The app learned how to swing by internalising the jazz vocabulary and playing based on real transcriptions from the masters.\n\n- Actual voice leading!\nNo matter what your settings are, just press play and you’ll always have the same attention to voice leading from the pianist and the same effort in creating beautiful lines from the bassist to accompany you.\n\nReady to take your skills to the next level?"

It can also be used on its own for finger-drumming or driven by a controller like a keyboard or drum pad.  It has 16 slots that start off with our factory kits, but you can load your own sounds using our sample browser or drop in a drum loop and have Sitala slice it automatically.\n\nSitala features:\n\n• 16 drum pads, each of which can play a user-assigned sample\n• Sample browser that lets you quickly swipe through all samples in a folder without importing each individual sample\n• 3 built-in drum kits: 808, retro and hip-hop\n• AudioUnit v3 plugin\n• Beat-slicer that automatically slices loops into individual drum sounds\n• Velocity sensitive, MIDI mappable pads\n• Special finger drumming mode with 4 giant pads for often used samples\n• Editable start and end points for each sample\n• A separate output for each pad (in multi-out mode) for hosts that support such (e.g. AUM and Cubasis)\n• Sitala for iOS can load kits created by Sitala for the desktop (macOS, Windows and Linux) and vice versa\n\nSix controls to sculpt each sample:\n\n• Shape: adjust the attack, length and sustain of your sounds while the overall volume remains constant\n• Compression: make your sounds punchier with more sustain Automatic gain makeup maintains the overall volume while chainging dynamics\n• Tuning: pitch sounds up or down by up to one octave while showing you exactly where the current sound falls in the frequency spectrum\n• Tone: emphasizes the highs or lows in a sound. Accentuate or scoop the midrange to position the sound in the mix. Adapts based on the pitch content of each sound\n• Volume\n• Pan"

A GPU-powered, fast and advanced integrated editor is part of TouchOSC on all platforms - create the most complex of control layouts with ease and precision.\n\nMIDI, OSC and more...\n\nTouchOSC supports sending and receiving any number of MIDI and OSC messages on many connections simultaneously. On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

      "label": "Creating sounds with time-varying timbre, on your mobile device.\nKORG iWAVESTATION - A wave sequence synthesizer for iOS.\n\nThe WAVESTATION synthesizer went on sale in 1990. This instrument featured an advanced vector synthesis system which created new sounds by combining and connecting multiple waveforms; it provided a mix/morphing function that let you use a joystick to change the balance of four oscillators, and a distinctive wave sequence function that allowed you to place waveforms in a desired sequence to create sequence patterns. To this day, it continues to be considered a legendary and still-unique instrument.\n\nNow in 2016, the WAVESTATION has been reborn as \"KORG iWAVESTATION,\" an app for iPad/iPhone. In addition to completely reproducing the programs, it also features a renewed design that lets everyone experience the stupendous sound-shaping potential of the WAVESTATION. It features touch-based operation that's distinctive of iOS, in conjunction with a new graphic interface that allows you to visualize and edit the time-varying timbral changes that are distinctive of the WAVESTATION. \n\n[ Features ]\n\n- A faithful reproduction of the original WAVESTATION sound: In addition to providing the sounds from all PCM memories of the WAVESTATION, the new iWAVESTATION also reproduces in software every detail of the parameters, based on an analysis of the original hardware circuit diagram.\n\n- A new wave sequence view that can be graphically controlled: The iWAVESTATION, we advance another step with a graphical user interface that takes advantage of the touch operations that are a characteristic of iOS. Even more than ever, we've updated the screen design with an emphasis on creating sequences.\n\n- 1,500 sounds, more than 700 waveforms, 55 effects, and a powerful random sequence engine: This new instrument includes a stupendous number of presets and waveforms, covering all models of the series. iWAVESTATION also provides a new random sequence function which will give you different perspectives to inspire new sounds.\n\n- Produce music together with KORG Gadget integration: iWAVESTATION can be used in conjunction with the \"KORG Gadget\" music production DAW app that has won numerous awards around the world. If both apps are installed, it can be used as the \"Milpitas\" gadget inside the KORG Gadget app.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

No additional software needed!\nSend all possible Notes, Continuous Controller / Control Change and Program Change values to the connected device.\n\nBuild your workspace from the ground up with unlimited, custom Pushes/Buttons and Sliders.\nAll Pushes/Buttons and Sliders are completely customisable - customize every value of every control possible and how the control behaves. You can even create dynamic controls (e.g. Program Change values that count up or down).\n\n• Works with every macOS: From 10.5 (Leopard) up to the newest 10.15 (Catalina)\n• Works on every iPhone and iPad\n• Also works with external hardware (e.g. synths,...) that supports Apple (CoreMidi)\n• If your hardware/PC does not support CoreMidi, you can use an iPhone/iPad compatible MIDI-Interface as bridge to make MidiController work with ALL MIDI devices\n\nWorks with every application that supports MIDI-Input.\nExample DAWs (Digital Audio Workstation):\n* Logic X Pro\n* Ableton Live\n* Avid Pro Tools\n* Propellerhead Reason\n* Steinberg Cubase\n* Cockos Reaper\n* and many more (in principle every application that supports midi input)\n\n** NOTES **\n• MidiController does not play any sound itself, it only sends out MIDI-Information to connected devices.\n• MidiController is primary created to work with macOS-Devices. If you want to use MidiController with hardware that does not support Apple CoreMidi, you might need an iPhone/iPad compatible MIDI-Interface as bridge. A MIDI interface typically connects to your iOS per lightning port and provides standard MIDI DIN ports to connect to your hardware. There are also bluetooth MIDI interfaces that connect wirelessly.\n• MidiController does not receive any MIDI-Information, it generates and sends them itself depending on the user-input."

It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

Pick an instrument for each square or triangle (shapes) and let them walk around. Rotate the arrows to alter their paths. Now choose from an exotic list of arrow types to spice things up.\n\nShapes also have a mind of their own. By using crossroads and teleports they will have to decide for themselves which direction to take. This phenomenon will give you endless surprising results, but you’ll be able to keep full control by adjusting each crossroad/teleport bias.\n\n• Use the factory sets to play around and have lots of fun instantly! Or,\n• Create your own sets with the many features available!\n\n\nEach arrow contains adjustable values such as pitch, note duration, volume, etc, while shapes can interpret these values in their own way. For instance, a shape can add an octave to each pitch it comes across, so it will play all the notes one octave higher. \n\nUse delay and reverb to add flavor, use the advanced preset and generator systems to save and modify the grid, use the rules system to determine what should happen when two shapes meet, and much more.\n\nNew Path is also able to communicate with other hard- & software. With the MIDI out feature, New Path can control for example your hardware synthesizers. Use the Ableton Link feature to sync Link-enabled devices and play together with your friends. And finally, the Audiobus integration lets you send both audio and MIDI to other apps on your device (You will need the Audiobus app).\n\nKey Features\n• A well thought out interface designed for both fast editing and playing live on-stage\n• Have surprising results with exotic arrow types such as crossroads and teleports\n• 70+ instruments such as Drums, Bass, Plucked, Synths, Acoustic, and Fx\n• Midi editor with a scales system\n• Many useful shape settings such as: Attack, Release, Note Value Multiplier to make non-western rhythms, etc\n• A preset system to instantly save and recall grid and shape settings\n• An advanced grid generator/modulator\n• A system of “If-Then” rules to trigger actions when shapes meet each other\n• A mixer with Delay and Reverb\n• 5x5 Arrow Cells with data such as: velocity, note duration, note value, repeat chance, crossroad chance, CC out, and much more…\n• 9 Tutorials with example sets to get you started \n\nNew Path supports\n• Ableton Link\n• iCloud device sync\n• iCloud export/import\n• Audiobus support (midi and audio)\n• Midi out \n\nIn-App Purchase\n• Arrow Skins\n• Instrument Expansion Pack\n• Audio Unit v3 (AUv3)\n\nAbout AUv3\n• In case you bought New Path before 28th December 2022 (for $6.99), email a screenshot with proof of your purchasing date and we’ll email a promo code for the AUv3 feature (info@studiothezooo.com)\n\nGet New Path today to create a treasury of musical gems! \n\n* Runs on iPhone 5s with iOS 11.0 and above"

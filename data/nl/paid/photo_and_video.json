Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  \n\nOK!  Now what??\n\nDo you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do!

ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!\n\nWorth a shot !

      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR.

Share your screen on a Smart TV, Mac, PC, Laptop, Gaming Console, Smartphone or Tablet.\n\nThe Screen Mirroring App can connect to any Web Browser and cast your screen with zero delay in HD quality. Screen Mirroring over DLS / Cable / Internet is supported by Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge and the newest Smart TVs.\n\nThis is the easiest and most powerful screen sharing tool. Share your photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations and documents with your friends and family, even to remote places.\n\n* Supported devices: Any device with an integrated Web Browser, e.g. Samsung TV, LG TV, Panasonic TV, Hisense TV, Philips TV, Hitachi TV, Grundig TV, TCL TV\n\n* Local mirroring on WiFi: Your iPhone/iPad and your web browser device must be connected to the same wifi. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Remote mirroring is limited to DSL / Cable / Internet. Connections over cellular/mobile networks (LTE/5G) are not yet supported.\n\n* Latency is supreme (0 seconds) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* You don't need a companion App on your TV or receiving device\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nThis app is brought to you by the developers of Video & TV Cast, the #1 video casting app in the world with more than 100.000.000 downloads across all platforms and devices.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with any of the trademarks mentioned here."

      "label": "Designed by a photographer for photographers, focused on RELIABILITY and PRECISION for digital and analog photography.\n\n• Extended sensitivity as low as -2/-4EV (dark scenes)\n\n• Two different convenient interface designs.\n\n• Incident and reflected light metering modes.\n\n• Save exposure data.\n\n• f/Tools connection.\n\n• Independent calibration for the two metering modes.\n\n• Independent selection of aperture, speed, ISO and exposure compensation with 1/3 resolution. From 4 minutes to 1/8000 sec., aperture from 1.0 to 512 and iso from 3 to 6400.\n\n• Automatic priority for aperture or speed. (Automatic Av and Tv modes).\n\n• Automatic ISO or locked ISO options.\n\n• Point metering in camera view.\n\n• Maximum aperture limited by the selected lens.\n\n• Calculate the average of any number of measurements you want.\n\n• Read the exposure data of any photo from the gallery.\n\n• Calculate hyperfocal distance for 5 memorized lenses. Which also blocks maximum aperture.\n\n• Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.\n\n• Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light. (IR button)\n\n• Exposure value EV on an analog scale or right up front.\n\n• Two LED indicators show whether the measurement is unreliable due to lack of light in the scene, or if we have under 30% battery left.\n\n• On 3.5 \" displays preset lens buttons tilting the device or tapping at the bottom.\n\n• Be advised that accurate incident light reading needs a diffuser attached to the front camera. Without the diffuser still can be used but think about it, it will be a reflected reading taken with the front camera.\n\nI'm an independent photographer/designer/developer and am very grateful for your support. Trying to do the best lightmeter app ever, a lot more to come. You can ask for any improvement and I'll be happy to help. This app is constantly reviewed and improved because it is my tool, if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me by email at davidquiles@me.com\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid Quiles"

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Fire TV.\n\n* Supported Fire TVs: Fire TV Box+Stick, Fire TV Cube and all other devices of the Fire TV Family.\n\n* Supported TVs: Insignia TV and Toshiba TV with Fire TV Edition\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Fire TV must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store.

It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast.

      "label": "Reeflex is the best photography app on the App Store designed for enthusiasts, creatives, and professional photographers! The app provides pro-level DSLR features directly on your iPhone while being extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\n— Professional Tools for Everyone —\n\nReeflex offers two main capture modes - the main one for classic still photography and the IAP long exposure photography mode - providing a rich set of professional tools for full manual control over focus, exposure, and white balance. The live histograms combined with the zebra stripes allow you to precisely monitor your exposure. The focus peaking is a powerful guide for adjusting the focus on your subject. By a simple two-finger tap on the viewfinder, Reeflex also allows you to independently adjust focus and exposure, moving two reticles across the scene.  \n\nReeflex allows shooting in HEIF, JPG, TIFF, or RAW on all iPhone models. You can also shoot in the Apple ProRAW* format and 48MP*** on compatible devices.\n\n— Slow Shutter Mode (IAP) —\n\nReeflex offers the best long-exposure tools on the App Store. Enjoy the flexibility of manual controls and watch the picture forming on the screen. Select either Motion Blur or Light Trails modes to make people disappear, give moving water & cloudy skies a smooth silky appearance, or transform busy roads and starry skies into stunning rivers of light. Long Exposure on iPhone has never been easier than now!\n\n— Honorable Mentions —\n\nOnly a few days after its launch Reeflex was listed as “Must Have APPS - You Never Heard About” by the highly popular iReviews YouTube channel. Reeflex Pro Camera is now a top-tier camera app vastly acclaimed among the iPhone photography community worldwide, being featured by some as the \"best camera app\" for 2022 across several youtube channels and mobile photography magazines (Mobiography.net, PhotoFocus.com, iPhonephototeam.com)\n\n— MAIN FEATURES —\n\n• Still photography mode with full manual controls\n(ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance)\n• Automated Focus and Exposure reticles (AF/AE)\n• Luma and RGB zebra stripes\n• Live luma and RGB histograms \n• Advanced focus peaking\n• Support for multiple cameras\n• JPEG, HEIF, or TIFF as processed formats\n• Apple’s ProRAW* and RAW** support\n• Wide Angle camera 48MP support***\n• GPS location in photos’ metadata\n• Gyroscopic tiltmeter\n• Extended digital zoom up to 10x\n• Integrated camera roll\n• Color-blind users' support: customization of focus peaking colors\n• Tutorials, tips, and detailed explanations are available in the settings section\n\n— SLOW SHUTTER MODES (in-app purchase) —\n\n• Motion blur mode: blur movement, from silky waterfalls to dreamy cloudy skies\n• Light trails mode: transform busy roads and starry skies into stunning rivers of light\n• Wide range of long-exposure capture durations, from 0.5 seconds up to 2 hours\n• Bulb mode - select a custom long-exposure capture duration\n• Live Preview - allows you to monitor the long-exposure capture\n\n— REMARKS —\n\n*ProRAW is only supported on iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.\nOn other iPhone devices, when the RAW format is selected, photos will be saved in the standard Bayer RAW format.\nNote: RAW format requires an iPhone 6s or later.\n\n**On devices older than iPhone 12, hence from iPhone 11 and prior, the RAW format is not supported on the Ultrawide camera\n\n***48MP is only supported on the main Wide Angle camera on the latest iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.\nNote: RAW format does only support 12MP.\n\n— GET IN TOUCH —\n\nWe'd love to hear from you!

      "label": "Intuitive yet powerful, Lumos accurately predicts the position of the sun and moon at any time, on any day, in any place. Whether you’re planning a photo shoot, a wedding, or a solar panel installation, tracking the sun and moon has never been easier!\n\nLumos is divided into six main modules:\n\n• The augmented reality view harnesses the power of AR to visually project past, present, or future sun and moon positions (and moon phases!) onto your surroundings, letting you perfectly visualize your plans.\n\n• The map view overlays the sun and moon positions for a given time and location onto a map of that location, letting you make plans from afar.\n\n• The Street View mode works like the AR view, but it takes advantage of Google Street View to allow you to envision sun and moon positions for remote locations (requires Lumos Pro).\n\n• The calendar view displays a simple list of rise/set times and moon phases throughout the year, letting you see the big picture at a glance. Tap a row to see the detailed ephemeris for that day.\n\n• The notifications module lets you sign up to receive notifications for significant solar and lunar events, including: astronomical, nautical, and civil dawn/dusk, blue hour, golden hour, sunrise/set, solar noon, moon rise/set, lunar transit, and lunar perigee/apogee (requires Lumos Pro).\n\n• The shadow length view calculates the exact length of the shadow an object will cast on a given time and day, letting you see the result both visually and numerically. You can also calculate the height of an object if you know the length of its shadow.\n\n\nWith an affordable one-time purchase of Lumos Pro, you can also:\n\n• Search for a location by name or manually enter coordinates\n\n• Save locations for later reference or offline use*\n\n• Take notes on a saved location and have them readily available the next time you view it\n\n\n*The map view and Street View do not currently support offline use\n\nNOTE: The sun and moon positions calculated by Lumos are accurate to within a small fraction of a degree. However, as with any augmented-reality app, the accuracy of the projection is dependent on the underlying hardware. If you are seeing inaccurate positions, please calibrate your device's compass and ensure that you are not near any sources of electromagnetic interference (e.g. microwaves, computers, car engines, high voltage lines). Phone cases containing batteries are known to cause compass interference. You can also use the visual calibration tool to align the projection with sun’s current position. Please feel free to contact us if you continue to have issues.\n\n_____________\n\nTerms of Use: https://termsfeed.com/terms-use/c5bcd4de47ffe3020e8aebd04a91af68\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/8042948/full-legal"

Watermarking can also be used to add your email, url, a personal message or fun graphics to any photo or Pokemon Go screenshot.\n\n\"It's by far the best watermarking App I've seen to date on iOS.\"\n- Terry White, review on bestappsite.com\n\nVideo Review by the Daily App Show:\nhttp://dailyappshow.com/iwatermark\n\nThanks to all iWatermark users for the great reviews, feedback and suggestions. \n\niWatermark, is the only watermarking tool available for all 4 platforms iPhone/iPad, Mac and Windows. iWatermark is the most popular professional watermarking tool for photos.\n\nSocial media sharing at full resolution to Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Twitter, Camera Album, Clipboard or Email (3 resolution options).\n\nFeatures\n\n  * Touch gestures.\n     ** Click to move the watermark location.\n     ** Pinch/zoom to expand/contract the size of the watermark. \n     ** Two fingers at once to rotate the watermark to any angle.\n  * Batch processing (all at once) or sequential.\n  * Easily adjust the watermarks scale, opacity, font, color, size, position and angle.\n  * Create your own subtle text or graphic watermarks or select from the included example watermarks (both text and graphics).\n  * Included examples are both text (names, dates, tag data, etc.) and graphic (signatures, logos, etc.) watermarks which can be used immediately. \n  * 162 fonts for your text watermarks 112 + 50 iOS fonts.\n  * Displays each font.\n  * 34 high-res watermarks.\n  * Import your own graphic watermarks by sending yourself an email with attached graphic.\n  * One button import of your signature for use as a watermark.\n  * Complete and easy to understand manual.\n  * Create a QR watermark which is like a barcode. QR codes can contain up to 4000 chars of information. QR codes can then be read with a scanner or smartphone with the right app revealing the info you encoded. \n\nWhy Watermark?\n\nDigitally sign your photos/artwork with iWatermark to claim, secure and maintain your intellectual property and reputation.\n\n- Photos go viral then they fly off globally. Watermark with name, email or url so your photo has a visible and legal connection to you.\n- Build your company brand, by having your company logo on all your images.\n- Promote your company, name and website by using QR codes as watermarks.\n- Avoid the surprise of seeing your photos and/or artwork elsewhere on the web or in an ad.\n- Avoid the conflicts, costly litigation and headaches from plagiarists who claim they didn't know that you created it.\n- Avoid intellectual property (IP) squabbles.\n\nQ:I want to stamp my signature as my watermark. How do I add my graphic signature like the examples, Picasso, Ben Franklin, etc.? \nA:Use our signature tool or make the .png graphics on your computer, email it to yourself, open the email on your iOS device and save to your photo album. In iWatermark create a graphic watermark and choose the graphic from your photo album to add it as a new watermark.\n\nQ:Will it work with Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus?\nA:Yes\n\nSee the manual for more details:\nhttp://www.plumamazing.com/iphone/iwatermark-iphone/iwatermarkhelp/\n\nIMPORTANT: The signatures of John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Galileo are just examples of graphic watermarks. They are the real signatures of these historic people. They are there as examples to show what is possible. We recommend you create your own signature, logo or QR code watermarks.\n\nContact us if you need help or have a suggestion."

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any video you want on your Amazon Fire TV (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

Combine multiple photos to create artistic double exposure, surreal or just fun juxtaposed photo. \n\nSuperimpose provides a very simple workflow, which almost anyone can follow. Yet, it provides a wide range of tools suitable even for advanced users, to create complex compositions.\n\nBlend/mix/combine/cut/copy and paste one photo on another. Creating double exposure photo is as easy as loading two photos and then choosing opacity and blending modes.\n\nWith advanced masking tools, you can manually or semi-automatically erase portions from one image and then blend that with another photo. From magic lasso, that cuts out an image from a roughly painted boundary to a simple brush masking tool, you can use wide range of masking tools to create all sorts of masking, using this app.\n\nThe app has tons of masking tools like brush, smart brush, magic wand, magic lasso, lasso, polygon, rectangle, ellipse, linear and radial gradient and color range. Text masking tool and you can even create a mask from an image.\n\nAnd how do you cut out hair or fur of your pet? You can create fine mask of hair, using hair masking tool even to cut out hair!\n\nTo keep the flow simple, Superimpose works with two photos at a time. But you can keep merging and keep adding more and more layers of photos to create complex compositions.\n\nTo blend two photos even better, the app supports a set of adjustment tools like exposure, saturation, hue, color balance, curve etc.\n\nApart from blending, advanced masking and filters, Superimpose comes equipped with assorted set of editing tools like perspective correction, adding text with extensive text settings and tools like motion blur, zoom blur etc.\n\nCreating a natural shadow of objects that you blend with a photo is easier than ever. A dedicated tool just to create a shadow.\n\nStore all your cut outs, stickers or masks in a built-in mask library. For example, you can take photo of your products, mask them and then save them in the mask library. You can later add those cut outs on a background you want to add it to.\n\nCreate a fun photo by adding one part of the photo as a foreground and another photo as a background.\n\nSave images in high resolution either in JPEG, PNG or HEIC format."

      "label": "ReeXpose is the best app for long exposure photography on the App Store. Designed by professionals for professionals, ReeXpose closes the gap between your iPhone and a DSLR camera, allowing you to shoot long exposure photos in RAW. All without the need for additional ND filters!\n\nSelect your capture mode, adjust your exposure, chose your capture duration and ReeXpose will do the rest. The result will be a single, 12bit DNG file editable in your favorite editing software.\n\nUse the “motion blur” mode to make people disappear, smooth the movement of clouds or give running water a characteristic silky appearance. Use the “light trails mode” for stunning star trails or to transform moving cars into gorgeous rivers of light. Enjoy the flexibility of full manual controls and the extended dynamic range given by RAW files.\n\nReeXpose is brought to you by Reeflex, the small studio behind the development of Reeflex Pro Camera. \n\n --- MAIN FEATURES ---\n\n- RAW capabilities* for long exposure\n- Extended capture time, from 1s to Bulb**\n- Full manual controls for ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance\n- Motion blur & Light trails mode \n- Exposure guides like histogram and zebra stripes \n- Focus peaking\n- Apple Watch integration for remote shutter\n- Photo backup in the File app\n- Gyroscopic tiltmeter and Grid (rule of thirds)\n- GPS location in the photo’s metadata\n- Language support: English, Spanish, German, French, Italian\n- Blazing fast processing & saving time (1ms)\n- Lock Screen Widget for quick access\n\n--- PRO FEATURES (available through in-App purchase) ---\n\n- Interims results: allows to capture intermediate photos during a long capture\n- Parallel Bracketing: allows to capture 2 photos at different selected exposures for HDR bracketing in post-production\n\n--- ACCESSIBILITY ---\n\n- Color-blind users can now tune the app to best suit their needs, customizing the UI and color coding.\n\n--- CREDITS ---\n\nA big thanks to all our beta testers and collaborators, especially Bintang, Darek, Dale, Germain Julian, Yohsuke, Reece, David, and Shayne. Without you, this project would not be possible. \n\n—- REMARKS —-\n\n*The RAW format is not supported for the ultra-wide camera of devices older than the iPhone 12 series\n**As usual for long exposure, you must use a tripod and keep the phone as steady as possible\n\nWe'd love to hear from you and get your feedback. If you have any ideas on new features or improvements, please email us at: support@reeflexstore.com\n\nTo stay up to date and receive regular updates, subscribe to our newsletter (reeflexstore.com/pages/newsletter) or follow us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (@ReeflexCamera)"

Helios helps you improve your photos by notifying you of four magical times of the day.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe golden hour is the period of daytime shortly after sunrise or before sunset, during which daylight is redder and softer than when the Sun is higher in the sky. The opposite period during twilight is the blue hour, just before sunrise or after sunset, when indirect sunlight is evenly diffused. Photography during magic hours is proven to result in better photos than pictures taken at any other time of the day. The app is available around the globe and works without internet connection. It's an essential tool for all photographers and videographers.\n\nDESIGN\nHelios features a beautiful design that follows iOS 12 design language with incredible precision, making the experience truly breathtaking. An elegant dark theme is also available.\n\nFEATURES\nWith advanced tools like augmented reality lens and built-in light meter, planning your photos has never been easier. Powerful calendar and map tool can predict magic hour times, as well as sun and moon positions with extreme accuracy for days, weeks or even months in advance. By saving other locations, you can make sure you'll be prepared to capture the world around you wherever life takes you. Daily notifications help you stay up to date with slightest changes in time and duration of sunset, sunrise and magic hours.\n\n\nFeatured by Apple on the App Store Today page. Picked as one of the best iOS apps by TechnoBuffalo and Apple User."

Recover all shadow and highlight details in post-production.\n\nASTROPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nBy combining (\"stacking\") multiple photos with the same composition, you can drastically reduce camera noise in post-production. Use Shutter to catch multiple exposures of the night sky. This will allow you to produce stunningly clear images of the Milky Way and Northern Lights (aurora borealis).\n\nLIFESTYLE PHOTOGRAPHY FOR INSTAGRAM AND SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nNo one better understands your Instagram business than yourself. Compose perfect shots and improve your Instagram engagements. With Shutter's timer you can take as many photos as you want without hubby's bored face.

      "label": "Watch any web-video, online movie, livestream or live tv show on your Samsung Smart TV or Blu-ray Player. Enjoy the show on your big screen with the no#1 web video streamer.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast for Samsung Smart TV you can browse the web and stream any web video, online movie, livestream or live tv show you want on your Samsung Smart TV. Mp4, m3u8, hls livestreams and also video-over-https are supported.\n \nThere is no time limit at all! You can watch videos of 2 minutes or 2 hours or even more. Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for link detection and send the video with a single tap to your Samsung Smart TV. The discovered link will be shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the Samsung App Store (Smart Hub) on your TV or Blu-ray Player, search for 'TV Cast' and install the receiver app.\n\n* Please enter the ip-adress of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your Samsung TV Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and other DRM protected videos like HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please use the Remote Playbar for video control while browsing (see more info below)\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all Samsung Smart TVs and Blu-ray Players. You can also use the included TV Remote for basic video control (play, pause, stop, forward and rewind videos) and navigating in Samsung Smart Hub. The TV Remote currently works on 2010 - 2013 TVs.\n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Samsung or any other trademark mentioned here."

The program was dead on…\" - National Geographic\n\n\"One of the most powerful photography applications that I've seen, one that you'll be using for years and years.\"  - AdoramaTV\n\nThe Photographer's Ephemeris (TPE) helps plan outdoor photography shoots in natural light, particularly landscape and urban scenes.

It is recalling the images you took 72 hours later, when 80% of your memory has blurred and faded away, will turn your short-term memory into long-term memory. Our team also has attempted to reproduce the in-the-moment experience of taking photos by eliminating the Instant Review feature found on conventional digital cameras and reducing 95 % of the conventional viewfinder feature, leaving only the bare minimum needed for taking shots.\n\n\"Gudak-dari Camera\", as its name suggests, refers to a time-worn and antique camera. Living in a digital generation where \"Un-do\" function is prevalent, we may have lost\n\nthe thrill of making new and conscious decisions. \"Patients is a virtue\" has faded its original value and people are getting used to selecting one palatable photo out of a myriad of photos. Amid this so-called \"digitalization\", we hope you to recall the thrill of making new choices by seizing the \"Gudak Moment\".\n\nGudak 3.2 Update has added a self-camera feature that allows you to shoot with a front camera as Gudak feels.\nExperience a new look of Gudak and a variety of emotional photos with front cameras as well as rear cameras. The theme will be updated further in the future.\n\n*The Lecoq film is only available in Korea.\n\nAlso, for those who feel that Gudak photos are dark, you can adjust the brightness of photos through the newly added ISO (based on world standard film sensitivity).\n\nA Gudakbook icon has been added to make Gudak photos a real album. Try to experience the feeling of those days through Gudakbook like the excitement I felt when printing the film camera. You can apply for Gudakbook through the print icon on the Printed Envelope Check page.\n\n\n[Explanation of Authority ]\n\nEssential access authority\n- Cameras: Camera access for photography\n- Save: External Storage Read/Write permissions for photoshooting, storing, and bringing in\n\nSelective access\n* You can use the service without agreeing to access rights.\n- Location: Location access to tag location information in pictures"

After you've wrapped a shoot, scene, or interview, email your notes as a CSV file (excel spreadsheet) to use during post. \n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n- Set the timer to match the timecode on your camera.\n- Press the marker button every time you have an interesting shot.\n- Write a note for the marker or use one of the 'quick note' buttons above the keyboard\n\nSYNC TIMECODE\n\n• Manually with keypad\n• With clock time\n\nWHAT ELSE?\n\n• Custom set FPS\n• Customize the 'Quick Notes' that you use most often when logging\n\nCUSTOMER FEEDBACK:\n\n- \"I've tried the whole range of available TC logging apps out there - from Moviestate Pro, Logster, and most of the others that have come out, whether or not they accept external timecode input. Timecode+ is the nicest so far for straight logging.\"\n\n- \"TimeCode+ is essential to efficiently editing soccer games down to just the highlights.\""

The duration and timing of the Blue Hour varies depending on location and on the date. In order to achieve optimum results and to plan in advance the app Blue Hour (solar calculator) has been developed.\n\nThe calculations are not only limited to the blue hour. Further information for sun and moon events can also be calculated. This includes information about sunrise, sunset together with data of the blue hour, golden hour and twilight times (civil, nautical and astronomical). Furthermore you can calculate information about moonrise, moonset, moon phases and moon illumination (calculated data are approximations of +/- 1 day accuracy).\n\nIn this app you can view data for multiple locations. These can be defined manually or automatically by getting your GPS location. Additionally you have the opportunity to manually set timezones of the locations, which can be helpful if you are planning trips to locations with another timezone than the one, where you currently are in.\n\nCore features at a glance:\n• Calculation of sunrise, sunset and solar noon\n• Calculation of moonrise and moonset, moonphase and moon illumination\n• Calculation of civil blue hour\n• Calculation of twilight times (civil, nautical and astronomical)\n• Calculation of golden hour\n• Visualization of the azimuth-data of sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset\n• Visualization of the azimuth-data of sun and moon for specific time\n• Reminder for events\n• monthly forecast\n• 5 days weather prediction\n• definition of multiple locations, including current position (based on GPS)\n\nNote: the calculated values are approximations. Additionally it depends on weather situation, how good or if any solar event is visible."

Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

      "label": "DoubleTake by Filmic transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll."

Whether you’re planning a photo shoot, a wedding, or a solar panel installation, tracking the sun and moon has never been easier!\n\nLumos is divided into six main modules:\n\n• The augmented reality view harnesses the power of AR to visually project past, present, or future sun and moon positions (and moon phases!) onto your surroundings, letting you perfectly visualize your plans.\n\n• The map view overlays the sun and moon positions for a given time and location onto a map of that location, letting you make plans from afar.\n\n• The Street View mode works like the AR view, but it takes advantage of Google Street View to allow you to envision sun and moon positions for remote locations (requires Lumos Pro).\n\n• The calendar view displays a simple list of rise/set times and moon phases throughout the year, letting you see the big picture at a glance. Tap a row to see the detailed ephemeris for that day.\n\n• The notifications module lets you sign up to receive notifications for significant solar and lunar events, including: astronomical, nautical, and civil dawn/dusk, blue hour, golden hour, sunrise/set, solar noon, moon rise/set, lunar transit, and lunar perigee/apogee (requires Lumos Pro).\n\n• The shadow length view calculates the exact length of the shadow an object will cast on a given time and day, letting you see the result both visually and numerically. You can also calculate the height of an object if you know the length of its shadow.\n\n\nWith an affordable one-time purchase of Lumos Pro, you can also:\n\n• Search for a location by name or manually enter coordinates\n\n• Save locations for later reference or offline use*\n\n• Take notes on a saved location and have them readily available the next time you view it\n\n\n*The map view and Street View do not currently support offline use\n\nNOTE: The sun and moon positions calculated by Lumos are accurate to within a small fraction of a degree. However, as with any augmented-reality app, the accuracy of the projection is dependent on the underlying hardware. If you are seeing inaccurate positions, please calibrate your device's compass and ensure that you are not near any sources of electromagnetic interference (e.g. microwaves, computers, car engines, high voltage lines). Phone cases containing batteries are known to cause compass interference. You can also use the visual calibration tool to align the projection with sun’s current position. Please feel free to contact us if you continue to have issues.\n\n_____________\n\nTerms of Use: https://termsfeed.com/terms-use/c5bcd4de47ffe3020e8aebd04a91af68\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/8042948/full-legal"

      "label": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!"

The result will be a single, 12bit DNG file editable in your favorite editing software.\n\nUse the “motion blur” mode to make people disappear, smooth the movement of clouds or give running water a characteristic silky appearance. Use the “light trails mode” for stunning star trails or to transform moving cars into gorgeous rivers of light.

      "label": "Obscura 3 is a camera app packed full of features to help you take incredible photos. Obscura pairs a stunning design with intuitive controls that make taking photos a delight.\n—\n\nObscura 2 has been featured numerous times by Apple around the world, including as Editor’s Choice and App of the Day. And Obscura 3 is even better.\n—\n\nDesign\n\nObscura squeezes a bunch of powerful features into simple controls anyone can master. The interface balances aesthetics, ergonomics, and intuitiveness. You won’t want to use anything else. All the camera controls can be reached with one thumb, and gestures and haptics combine to create a tactile experience that lets you stay focused on your subject.\n—\n\nAppearance\nThemes, manual light and dark modes, custom app icons. All gorgeous. \n—\n\n\nCamera Features\n—\n\nModes\nObscura 3 has been designed around 5 distinct camera modes: \nPhoto - simple, fast performance\nPro Photo - maximum control \nDepth - portraits & depth data\nLive Photo - for.. Live Photos\nVideo - video capture with pro controls\n\nExposure\nTo adjust exposure, just touch your thumb to the Exposure Button and move it in a circle, like turning a dial. Couldn’t be simpler and it feels great. And you can just tap the button to instantly reset the exposure bias.\n\nFocus\nJust like exposure, drag your thumb around the Focus Button to focus manually. And you’ll get both a focus loupe and focus peaking to help you get your subject perfectly crisp. ^1\n\nISO & Shutter Speed\nTK\n\nWhite Balance\nAWB, White Point, Scene Presets, and manual Temp + Tint.\n\nPhoto Formats\nProRAW ^2, RAW, HEIC, and JPEG photos, Live Photos and Depth Data ^3. \n\nVideo Formats\n1080p or 4K at 24,30 or 60fps ^4\n\nFilters\nLots of new filters, some old favorites. You can now disable filters and set favorites for quick access. All included.\n\nAspect Ratio\nCapture photos in 4:3, 1:1, 16:9, and 2:1 aspect ratios.\n\nHistogram\nSmall or large, luminance or color.\n\nGrid\nLines, crosshairs, or none.\n\nSpirit Level\nFor perfectly level horizons that would make Wes Anderson proud.\n\nFlash\nYep.\n\nTimer\nI hear tick tock is really popular with the youths.\n\nPresets\nCustomise Obscura to your heart’s content, and save those customisations into presets to quickly access at any time.\n—\n \nLibrary\n\nNot only has the camera interface been redesigned, but the library has been reconsidered from the ground up to give you quick access to your most important photos, without sacrificing performance.\n—\n\nView Options\nObscura lets you configure exactly what’s displayed in the library views, so you can hide screenshots and memes to help you focus on your photos.\n\nYou can also adjust the size of thumbnails to suit your preference. And keep hidden photos hidden. Naturally.\n—\n\nImage View & Editing\nBrowse, share, fav, rate, edit. Whether you want to dig into metadata, triage through your vacation photos, or apply some cool filters, you’ll find it here.\n—\n\n\nSettings & More\nObscura’s Settings has a bunch of options, allowing you to manage filters, tweak camera behaviours, change the theme, read the walkthrough and more.\n—\n\nApple Watch Support\nUse your Apple Watch as a camera remote. You can change capture mode, set exposure and more!\n—\n\nGame Controller Support (Beta)\nIt’s a little rough, but yes, you can use a game controller to control your camera.\n———\n\n\n1. Manual Focus only available in single camera modes, not while using a Virtual Dual or Triple camera. Yes, this sucks but the virtual cameras are weird and full of quirks\n2. ProRAW only available on iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro\n3. Depth Data only available on Dual, Triple, or TrueDepth Camera systems\n4. Video formats vary by device\n\nThanks for checking out Obscura. If you decide to buy, we hope you’ll consider rating it, or sharing with someone you think might like it. \n\nAll the best,\nBen & Adam"

If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop.

      "label": "* Special Offer Price *\n\nNDICam is the original NDI iOS camera built by NDI broadcast infrastructure developers Sienna, mature and feature rich, uniquely with both Full NDI and NDI HX3 modes.\n\nThe NDI (Network Device Interface) protocol connects to professional vision mixers and other devices, and delivers a high quality, low latency connection. NDICam is compatible with VMC, TC1, TriCaster, VMix, Wirecast and dozens of other professional IP video systems which support NDI.\n\n- Simple to use - nothing to configure on your iOS device\n- Switch between front and rear cameras during broadcast\n- Auto Focus, AF Lock and Tap to Focus\n- Auto Exposure, AE Lock and Tap to Expose\n- Illumination light on/off\n- Audio Mute Control\n- Manual Naming of NDI Stream source\n- 4 quality / performance levels to suit your device and network, plus NDI HX Option \n- Pinch to zoom (where zoom is supported)\n- Auto-lens mode for multi-lens cameras\n- On screen live / preview tally plus optional use of camera flash as talent tally (with red gel cover).\n- Option to prevent iOS device sleep\n- Select 25FPS or 29.97FPS standard rate.\n- Choice of Full NDI or NDI HX3 compression modes (HX2 at 2 to 20 mBit, plus HX3 Ultra)\n- Rotation support for Portrait or Landscape Video Modes.\n\nFront and Rear cameras can be selected at the touch of a button and NDICam features a 4 position quality vs frame rate slider to deliver optimum video suited to the quality of your wifi connection and your iPhone's processing performance. Depending on your iOS device, compression mode selected and Wifi network performance NDICam supports up to 1080 full HD resolution.\n\nControl of flashlight, touch to focus, focus lock, pinch to zoom and audio enable are also included.  You can even use the phone's torch as a Tally Light, by covering it with a red gel.\n\nNote: Depending on the performance of your iOS device and your WIFI network, you may not see full frame rates when operating at maximum 1080 resolution with a full HD camera. Using HX3 mode will help if the bottleneck is your WIFI network.\n\nNote: NDI is a high bandwidth protocol designed for local area Gigabit networks. In order to see good results you will need a fast, uncontested wifi connection.  If you see slow frame rates, try improving the wifi environment, with a better router, less interference, directional antenna or maybe switch to 5GHz if you are on 2.4GHz. . \nNB HX3 Ultra will use around 50mBits of bandwidth, so its lower than full NDI, but still quite high. Use one of the lower bandwidth HX2 modes if your network connection is struggling/\n\nNDICam is also compatible with wired ethernet connections to iOS devices which can help deliver smooth video compared to a poor quality Wifi network. Good results have been seen with lightning to ethernet adaptors.\n\nYou can now specify an NDI4 discovery server in the application settings. Note that you will need to restart the app for any changes to take effect.  Specifying a discovery server will disable the standard mDNS (Bonjour) advertisement for the NDI Cam source, so your iOS device must be able to reach the discovery server one the network.  If you experience problems - delete the Discovery Server entry and restart the app.\n\nNB: NDI HX3 Ultra mode requires a recent NDI 5 compatible receiver."

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast.

Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!!

Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here.

Easily, secure and protect your photos with a text, graphic, signature or QR watermark. Adding a visible watermark to a photo displays it is created and owned by you. Watermarking is increasingly important and is like signing your name to an image. A watermark subtly displays, no matter where your photo goes, that it's yours. Watermarking can also be used to add your email, url, a personal message or fun graphics to any photo or Pokemon Go screenshot.\n\n\"It's by far the best watermarking App I've seen to date on iOS.\"\n- Terry White, review on bestappsite.com\n\nVideo Review by the Daily App Show:\nhttp://dailyappshow.com/iwatermark\n\nThanks to all iWatermark users for the great reviews, feedback and suggestions. \n\niWatermark, is the only watermarking tool available for all 4 platforms iPhone/iPad, Mac and Windows. iWatermark is the most popular professional watermarking tool for photos.\n\nSocial media sharing at full resolution to Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Twitter, Camera Album, Clipboard or Email (3 resolution options).\n\nFeatures\n\n  * Touch gestures.\n     ** Click to move the watermark location.\n     ** Pinch/zoom to expand/contract the size of the watermark. \n     ** Two fingers at once to rotate the watermark to any angle.\n  * Batch processing (all at once) or sequential.\n  * Easily adjust the watermarks scale, opacity, font, color, size, position and angle.\n  * Create your own subtle text or graphic watermarks or select from the included example watermarks (both text and graphics).\n  * Included examples are both text (names, dates, tag data, etc.) and graphic (signatures, logos, etc.) watermarks which can be used immediately. \n  * 162 fonts for your text watermarks 112 + 50 iOS fonts.\n  * Displays each font.\n  * 34 high-res watermarks.\n  * Import your own graphic watermarks by sending yourself an email with attached graphic.\n  * One button import of your signature for use as a watermark.\n  * Complete and easy to understand manual.\n  * Create a QR watermark which is like a barcode. QR codes can contain up to 4000 chars of information. QR codes can then be read with a scanner or smartphone with the right app revealing the info you encoded. \n\nWhy Watermark?\n\nDigitally sign your photos/artwork with iWatermark to claim, secure and maintain your intellectual property and reputation.\n\n- Photos go viral then they fly off globally. Watermark with name, email or url so your photo has a visible and legal connection to you.\n- Build your company brand, by having your company logo on all your images.\n- Promote your company, name and website by using QR codes as watermarks.\n- Avoid the surprise of seeing your photos and/or artwork elsewhere on the web or in an ad.\n- Avoid the conflicts, costly litigation and headaches from plagiarists who claim they didn't know that you created it.\n- Avoid intellectual property (IP) squabbles.\n\nQ:I want to stamp my signature as my watermark. How do I add my graphic signature like the examples, Picasso, Ben Franklin, etc.? \nA:Use our signature tool or make the .png graphics on your computer, email it to yourself, open the email on your iOS device and save to your photo album. In iWatermark create a graphic watermark and choose the graphic from your photo album to add it as a new watermark.\n\nQ:Will it work with Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus?\nA:Yes\n\nSee the manual for more details:\nhttp://www.plumamazing.com/iphone/iwatermark-iphone/iwatermarkhelp/\n\nIMPORTANT: The signatures of John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Galileo are just examples of graphic watermarks. They are the real signatures of these historic people. They are there as examples to show what is possible. We recommend you create your own signature, logo or QR code watermarks.\n\nContact us if you need help or have a suggestion."

A lens out of focus captured the light of a candle which resulted in a blurred image with octagonal-shaped diamonds dots.\n\nWithout losing the characteristics that made it a great success, we listened the opinions from our users and created an even better and more complete app! \n\nNow you can have even greater customization for your photos! \n\nIncrease, decrease, move, rotate, adjust the opacity of the effects and save at high resolution, are some of the most anticipated news!\n\nThere are now 121 effects!!! Including the new category NEON \n\nEasier to apply effects! And it looks even more beautiful and fresh! \n\nWe hope everyone can have again a unique experience with Lumiè!\n\n=====================\n\nUse #lumie tag on instagram\n\nfollow our inspirations instagram @lumieinspiration\n\n====================="

Experiment safely, you can always get back to where you started.\n- 20 blend modes (like Multiply, Screen and Overlay) let advanced iPhoneographers create unique effects.\n- The \"red mask\" view mode shows you just the top image with the erased parts in red. It is helpful when precisely cutting out an element.\n\n* WhatsOnIphone.com: \"The application works incredibly well and makes an otherwise challenging process simple and fun. It blows my mind that you can do such things on an iPhone.\"\n* TUAW: \"This $2.99 app is a lot of fun, as well as one of the best-executed compositing tools for a mobile device that I've ever seen.\"\n* IphoneAppReviews: \"Pretty much everyone, at some point in time, has had the uncontrollable urge to take a friend’s photo and do something truly evil with it.

And the best part is, you don’t need multiple cameras to do it!\n\nFabFocus works on all devices running iOS 12 and forward and uses advanced image recognition to detect people, and intelligently blurring the background, applying beautiful bokeh effects. \n\n————\n\nThe Big 2.0 Update\n\nFabFocus 2.0 is a complete rewrite and redesign, with the goal of making it as fast and simple as possible to make stunning portraits. Every last detail has been considered and refined to streamline the experience.\n\nWe hope you love it as much as we do.\n\n————\n\nFeatures\n\nFabFocus has a lot of different features. Here’s a quick overview.\n\n————\n\nFace Detection\n\nFabFocus will automatically detect faces in your photos, use a little computer magic to work out what’s in the foreground and then intelligently blur the background.\n\nIf a photo contains depth information, that is used that for even faster performance.\n\n————\n\nCamera\n\nFabFocus has its own camera interface, that automatically configures itself for portrait capture on supported devices. \n\n————\n\nEditing Tools\n\nFabFocus has a whole bunch of tools to help you refine your portraits.\n\n• Adjust the amount of blur applied to the background\n\n• Chose the shape of bokeh (even set it to love hearts or stars!)\n\n• Change the brightness and saturation of the foreground and background independently.\n\n• You can also draw to refine the selection of what’s in the foreground, great for tricky situations, or creating portraits of a wide variety of subjects, like pets, plants and more!\n\nWhile editing, you can quickly undo and redo your adjustments, and there are buttons to share and save your photos right away. \n\n————\n\nTake your portraits to the next level with FabFocus\n\n————\n\nFor support, please contact hello@ghostwheel.org"

If you are happy with the framing then you can get the big camera out. The app has a large database of camera sensors details and film formats but if the format you desire isn’t there you can add your own custom format. The app is targeted at stills photographers or film makers working in either film or digital. If you don’t have your big camera with you, Viewfinder Preview is still great for photo sketching, location scouting or story boarding.\n\nThe app includes\n\n- Customisable menus so you can include the film/sensor formats and focal lengths you care about.\n- A fully configurable light meter.\n- You can take photos with it, so you have a record of shots you were framing.\n- Photos taken with the app include additional data that describe the film format, focal length and lighting meter settings at the time the shot was taken\n- Add notes to your photos\n- A photo gallery for viewing photos taken with the app which also displays the additional data\n- Share images in emails, messages\n- Create albums of photos from the same project, trip etc\n- Create PDF documents of albums\n- Film stock emulation\n- Wide angle lens adapter support"

Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your TV or gaming console. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Google Cast enabled device immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, like Vizio TV, Toshiba TV, Sony TV, Philips TV, Sharp TV, Chromecast 1+2+Ultra, Nexus Player, Nvidia Shield gaming console\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast.

Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google, Sony, Philips, Vizio, Sharp, Asus, Nvidia or one of their products and trademarks."

Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  \n\nOK!  Now what??\n\nDo you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do!

ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!\n\nWorth a shot !

The program was dead on…\" - National Geographic\n\n\"One of the most powerful photography applications that I've seen, one that you'll be using for years and years.\"  - AdoramaTV\n\nThe Photographer's Ephemeris (TPE) helps plan outdoor photography shoots in natural light, particularly landscape and urban scenes. It's a map-centric Sun, Moon and Milky Way calculator: see how the light will fall on the land, day or night, for any location on earth.\n\nWhether you need at-a-glance information on today's sun, moon and Milky Way data for your current location, or need to plan a precise alignment of the full moon for a future shoot, TPE has the tools you need. The combination of augmented reality, line-of-sight analysis and visual search supports the most sophisticated photo planning needs.\n\nNight mode features a 3D representation of the Milky Way, pole stars and major constellations directly over the map, so you can easily visualize exactly how to align your shot.\n\nResearch and save your own list of favorite photographic locations, using 7 different map types (including 2 offline maps) and save them in your locations list. Favorite locations are always displayed right on the map.\n\nAdvanced features including visual sun and moon search, automatic time zone and elevation detection, correction for atmospheric refraction and height above the horizon, ensuring that you have the best possible information for planning your shoot.\n\nYou can even determine when the sun or moon will rise from behind nearby hills and mountains.\n\nKey features:\n\n- Time/direction of sun, moon, and galactic center rise/set\n- View azimuth and altitude of sun/moon and the galactic center for any time of day/night\n- Milky Way, stars and asterisms visualization via 3D map overlay\n- Moon phase and % illumination\n- Civil, nautical and astronomical twilight\n- 2 topographic maps\n- 2 offline map types\n- Movable map pins: drag and drop the pin exactly where you need it\n- Map autorotation using the compass (on compatible devices)\n- Shadow lengths displayed to scale on map\n- Save any location you want: no fixed lists\n- Celestial events including moon phases, apogee, perigee, solstice, equinox\n- Network connection not required for rise/set time, azimuths and sun/moon position\n\nAdvanced features:\n\n- Augmented reality view for on location scouting\n- Saved location synchronization between devices and the free TPE web app\n- Automatic time zone detection\n- Elevation above sea level\n- Distance, bearing and elevation angle between any two points\n- Location import/export from KML\n- Magnetic north option\n- Configurable timeline display\n- Sun/moon transit times\n- 'Golden hour' time/duration\n- Light pollution overlay\n\nGeek features:\n\n- Line of sight analysis\n- Find when the sun/moon will appear from behind a hill or ridge\n- Advanced visual sun and moon search\n- Azimuth or altitude search priority\n- New crescent moon visibility\n- Distance to the visible horizon\n\nAvailable map types include:\n\n- Standard, Satellite/Hybrid, Terrain\n- OpenCycleMap Topographic\n- OpenStreetMap\n\nSunrise/sunset color forecasts are available (covering lower 48, southern Canada and Europe) with a subscription to the Skyfire service, available via in-app purchase.\n\nNote:\n\n- Maps and elevation-based calculations require a data connection, except for offline map tiles previously downloaded and stored on your device\n- Topographic map data is available only between 60°N and 47°S\n- Availability of map types is subject to change, due to 3rd party map service availability, terms or conditions\n- The app itself supports only English language at present\n- Augmented reality requires an iPhone 6s (or later), iPad Pro or 2017 model and iOS 11 or later"

      "label": "Watch any web-video, online movie, livestream or live tv show on your Sony TV, Hisense TV or VEWD powered Smart TVs. Enjoy the show on your big screen with the no#1 web video streamer.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast for Sony TV you can browse the web and stream any web video, online movie, livestream or live tv show you want on your Sony TV. Mp4, m3u8, hls livestreams and also video-over-https are supported.\n \nThere is no time limit at all! You can watch videos of 2 minutes or 2 hours or even more. Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for link detection and send the video with a single tap to your Sony TV. The discovered link will be shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the App Store on your Sony TV, search for 'TV Cast' and install the companion app.\n\n* If your Sony TV is powered by Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, please download our dedicated App 'Video & TV Cast | Google Cast' to enable casting.\n\n* Please enter the ip-address of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your Sony Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* Please use the Remote Playbar for video control while browsing (see more info below)\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop.\n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Sony or any other trademark mentioned here."

It's all new with these great features:\n- build for iOS7\n- supports the 4\" Screens of iPhone5/s/c\n- supports retina\n- Much more comfortable selection of shutter speed and NDFilter (no wheel control)\n- Multi-Select! Finally! You can switch to Multi-Select-Mode with a single tap in the toolbar if you are a ND-Filter-Stacker like myself :) Just activate Multi-Select-Mode and tap on any Filter you have stacked to the lens for really long exposures.\n- Add your own Filters! Finally! You own a filter which is not listed in the default list? Just add it by f-stops, ND-Value or Factor.\n- Delete Filters. Just delete all filters you don't own and make selecting filters much more convenient\n- Reorder Filter. Order the Filter-List as you like it. Bring up the most used filters to the top of the list.\n\nThe core function is still the same as NDCalc:\n\nYou know the time without the filter -how long do you need to exp. WITH filter? Sounds easy but tell me quickly how long to exp. with an ND 1.8 if the time without filter is 1/320? \n\nNow you can! \n\nSet Filter and exp. time without the filter and you can see the correct time. In the example above 1/5 \n\nEven easier it shows you 5 because this is what you can set on a dSLR. Smaller letters showing you the actual time. For 12500'' it shows, that these are 3h, 28m and 20s. \n\nFor times of 4+ seconds you get a countdown button to easily stop longer exposures manually with a remote shutter release with alarm and vibration (if supported)."

      "label": "Sunny16 is a fun, easy to use exposure calculator that implements the Sunny 16 exposure rule and then some. This app is ideal for anyone with a film or digital camera with an M (manual) mode who wants a quick tool to help set up the perfect exposure or anyone who wants to understand the relationships between the elements that create a properly exposed image.\n\nSunny 16 is a basic photographic exposure rule that works like this: If it’s sunny set your aperture to f/16 and your shutter speed to the reciprocal of your film speed. Huh? Exactly! That's why we created Sunny16. To put it another way, if your film speed (ISO) is 200 set your shutter speed to 1/200 and your aperture to f/16. But what if you want to shoot at f/8? What if it's not quite sunny? What about heavy overcast? What if you want to shoot at 1/1000? Sunny16 answers all of those questions with just a tap.\n\nSunny16 features:\n• Equivalent Exposures: see the full range of equivalent exposures (also known as reciprocal exposures) for any film speed under natural lighting conditions.\n• Exposure Compensation: easily compensate +/- up to 5 stops for backlight or other common lighting conditions.\n• Implicit Priority Modes: if you set the shutter speed and then change the ISO, the lighting condition, or the exposure compensation, the shutter speed will remain the same and the f/stop will change (shutter priority). And vice versa for aperture priority. \n• Limits: if a particular shutter speed or f/stop is not available for the conditions you specify you won't be able to select it (you can try but the picker will politely roll back to a correct exposure). \n• Stop Increment: full, 1/2, or 1/3 stops.\n• Lighting: naturally occurring lighting conditions expressed in EV 100. Don't worry if you don't know or care what EV is, just use the descriptions. \n• ISO: film speed from 6 to 102400.\n• Shutter Speeds: from 1/16000 to 30\"\n• f/stops: from 1 to 32"

No subscription, no trial, no in-app purchases: buy once, use always on iPad and iPhone.\n2. Display EXIF, IPTC and other metadata of photos in iOS devices, iCloud Files and iCloud Stream.\n3. Edit, remove EXIF & metadata like camera info, photographer info, location & IPTC info and much more - in Apple Photos and also in iCloud Files! Geotagging directly on a map with location search.\n4. Save your work by using customizable templates - presets.\n5. Batch processing of many photos at the same time.\n6. Display EXIF data in an extension directly in the Photos app or in iMessage and many more.\n7. Privacy share: protect your privacy and share your photos with your people with or without EXIF data.\n8. Display EXIF source text - incl. its export.\n9. Copy EXIF data directly to clipboard.\n10. Focus on simple workflows and intuitive handling.\n11. No collection of personal data like many copy-cat apps in this category.\n12. Runs on iPad and iPhone. \n13. Is under active development.\n\nReal customer testimonials:\n\n\"Finally - This program is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use but very effective and comprehensive. And the best: Pay once and good! Thanks to the developer!\"\n\n\"Just good! - Comprehensive and zero effort to use. For me the best app to edit the EXIF data of my photos. The presets are great and finally no in-app purchases! Keep it up!\"\n\n\"IPad version - it is here - Many thanks to the developer. Now I can add location information to photos on iPad. The developer also responds very quickly to requests and suggestions for improvement.\"\n\n\"For a long time I was missing a possibility on the iPhone / iPad to store the location data of photos, because I still shoot a lot with \"old\" DSLRs and they do not have GPS. With this, this also works from Apple's photo app. \nWithout complications. That's how it should be!\"\n\nThe app works with:\n- All photos in your iPhone or iPad photo library, except ProRAW images.\n- Photos in iCloud (Files app)\n- Photos in photo stream\n\nDo you have questions or need help? Write to support@imagexif.de, we're happy to help!\n\nWhat the app doesn't do:\n- Changing the filename: EXIF isn't about filenames. Also iOS does not allow the renaming of photos in the Photos Library.\n- Changing the order of photos in the Photos Library. Apple decided that the only sorting criteria in iOS Photos Library is the date the photo has been added to the library.\n\nQuestion: What is EXIF data?\nEXIF stands for \"Exchangeable Image File Format.\"\nWhen you take or receive a photo with a digital camera, it contains invisible metadata. This is information attached to the photo that describes, for example, certain properties and settings of the camera or even the place where the picture was taken. Services that can read this data are able to collect the circumstances and contexts of the photos and match them with certain other events (e.g. calendar entries, motion profiles, etc.).\n\nQuestion: Why doesn't the app handle PNG?\nUnfortunately, the Photos API does not allow modification of PNG files, but saves them as JPG. Therefore, to avoid confusion, imagExif cannot edit PNGs."

We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "Reeflex is the best photography app on the App Store designed for enthusiasts, creatives, and professional photographers! The app provides pro-level DSLR features directly on your iPhone while being intuitive and easy to use in every situation.\r\n\r\n--- Professional Tools for Everyone ---\r\n\r\nReeflex offers a rich set of professional tools for full manual control over focus, exposure, and white balance. The live histograms combined with the zebra stripes allow you to precisely monitor your exposure. The focus peaking is a powerful guide for adjusting the focus over your subject. By a simple two-finger tap on the viewfinder, Reeflex also offers the possibility to independently adjust focus and exposure, moving two convenient reticles across the scene.  \r\n\r\nReeflex allows shooting in HEIF, JPG, TIFF, or RAW on all iPhone models. For compatible devices, you can also shoot in the Apple ProRAW format. \r\n\r\n--- Slow Shutter Mode --- \r\n\r\nReeflex offers the best long exposure tools on the App Store. Enjoy the flexibility of manual controls and watch the picture forming on the screen. Select either motion blur or light trails to make people disappear, give moving water a smooth silky appearance, or capture the movement of the night sky for stunning star trails. It has never been easier, the only limit is your creativity. \r\n\r\nOnly a few days after its launch, Reeflex was listed as “Must Have APPS - You Never Heard About!” by the highly popular iReviews YouTube channel. Check out the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M2PjNFbIjM\r\n\r\n--- MAIN FEATURES ---\n\r\n• Motion blur\r\n• Light trails\r\n• Wide range of selectable exposure duration, from 0.5 s to 2 hours.\r\n• Bulb mode for custom exposure duration\r\n• Full manual controls over ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance\r\n• Focus and exposure reticles \r\n• Luma and RGB zebra stripes\r\n• Live RGB and luma histograms \r\n• Advanced focus peaking \r\n• Support for multiple cameras\r\n• Apple’s ProRAW* and RAW** support\r\n• JPEG, HEIF, or TIFF as processed formats\r\n• GPS location in photos’ metadata\r\n• Gyroscopic tiltmeter\r\n\r\n--- ADDITIONAL FEATURES --- \r\n\r\n• Extended digital zoom up to 10x. \r\n• Integrated camera roll.\r\n• Customization of focus peaking color\r\n• Tutorials, tips, and detailed explanations in the settings section.\r\n\r\n--- WHAT'S COMING NEXT --- \r\n\r\nWe are working hard to include more advanced features such as:\r\n• RAW long exposures\r\n• Hand-held long exposures\r\n• Time-lapse, intervalometer, and bracketing\r\n\r\n--- REMARKS ---\r\n\r\n*ProRAW is only supported on iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 pro max. On other devices, when RAW mode is selected, photos will be saved in the Bayer RAW format. RAW mode requires an iPhone 6s or later.\r\n**On devices older than the iPhone 12, the RAW format is not supported on the ultrawide camera.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for new updates!\r\nWe'd love to hear from you and get your feedback. If you have any ideas on new features or improvements, please email us at info@reeflexstore.com."

      "label": "Finally on iOS™!\nThis app is the official iOS™ version of the classic app White Balance Color Temp Meter that has sold more than 25 000 copies around the world. This new app is much improved with calibration, real-time measurements and more.\n\nHave you ever experienced that the colors of your photos does not correspond to the colors of the scenes in front of you? Let this app help you to get more realistic and better looking photos!\n\nThis app measures the color temperature of the lighting so that you can set the appropriate white balance setting on your camera. You can also use it to measure the Kelvin temperature on LED lamps and other light sources. The app also supports basic green / magenta tint measurement (also known as Duv measurement).\n\nWhat is Color Temperature?\nColor temperature is a characteristic of visible light that measures the hue of light from a light source. Color temperatures are usually measured in Kelvin (K). Low color temperatures (below 3000 K) are called warm colors (red and yellowish white) while high color temperatures (above 5000 K) are called cool colors (blueish white). Technically the color temperature is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of comparable hue to that of the light source.\n\nWhen is Color Temperature Important?\nColor temperatures are of special interest in all kinds of color photography. The human eye easily compensates for the color temperature of different light sources. Most cameras today have a feature called Automatic White Balance, AWB, which tries to do the same. In some conditions this works OK, in other conditions the results are poor. Many photographers therefore prefer to manually set the white balance value on the camera to match the color temperature of the current scene. With this application you can measure the color temperature before doing the white balance setting on you camera to get a more accurate setting.\n\nYou can also use this app to learn about the color temperatures in your environment. With this knowledge you can develop a better understanding of how the color temperatures varies which helps you when you are trying to master the light and colors in your photography.\n\nHow Accurate are the Measurements?\nTo measure the color temperature accurately is more complex than it might appear. On a phone or tablet this is complicated further by the fact that all devices are different from each other. Uncalibrated values from the app can be seen as fairly good approximations. But with the use of calibration supported in this app and a proper white surface evenly lit by the light source you are measuring, you can usually get good accuracy.\n\nGot Feedback on the App?\nPlease send any feedback, ideas or improvement suggestions on the app to apps@contechity.com."

Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)\n\n\nMORE THINGS TO LOVE\n\nAs you dive deeper, you’ll find Things packed with helpful features.

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "Pipe Saddle Layout Calculator is a iPhone app that provides the fitter with the points to make an accurate cut (fish mouth, cope, etc) for piping (cylinder to cylinder) intersections. This app is intended to be used by fitters, welders, fabricators, or anyone who needs to join two metal cylinders at any angle.\n\nAre you still carrying that blue book around? Pipe Saddle Layout Calculator is the modern piping blue book. Confused about how to layout cut lines for joining two pieces of pipe? If you are a pipe fabricator, welder, or fitter who needs to make perfect saddle cuts, then this app is for you. Forget books, calculators, compasses, ancient saddle layout procedures, laptops, expensive CAD programs, mathematics or internet access to figure out how to make that perfect saddle joint.\n\nPipe Saddle Layout Calculator is easy. Pipe Saddle Layout Calculator provides the offset layout dimensions for that perfect pipe joint. This calculator works with any size pipe, any angle of intersection, and any wall thickness of pipe. User enters: main pipe, branch pipe, wall thickness (this app considers wall thickness, you don't want to leave too much metal, or take too much off) and branch angle. The calculator does the rest.\n\nThis calculator produces an on the fly ordinate table of the offsets. The beauty of this app is that it also produces full size pattern templates, so you don't have to measure and layout all of the work points. Now you can print out your pipe pattern templates for any size and any angle intersection. This version outputs patterns configured for an 8.5 X 11 (everyone has access to one of these), 11 X 17, and 24 X 36 printer sizes. So with this app and a 8.5 X 11 printer, the user can still produce any size pipe coping pattern.\n\nThe calculator is very versatile. Presently input and output is US based imperial and/or metric. Output is feet, or feet and inches, decimal or fractions (to 1/32\"). This app has been updated to support metric solutions.\n\nUser can control how much cut line accuracy he/she wants by setting how many control points are desired (infinite amount, user can get 8 control points, i.e. every 45 degrees or 360 control points, i.e every degree, or more). Most books only give 8 or 16 control points. This app allows an infinite amount. For example, a 2\" pipe needs fewer control points than a 48\"."

The Do Less To-Do List\n\nBento helps you do less, but more meaningful tasks.\nWe all have plenty of to-dos on our list and our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nBento doesn't replace your to-do list, it complements it!\nOne of the biggest productivity issues is prioritization - so we've limited you to 3 tasks per Bento box.\n\n---\n\nSo, how does Bento work?\n\nTASK LIMITS\n\nBento limits you to 3 tasks per box - to help you do less, but more meaningful to-dos. We limit how many boxes you can open to 7 boxes in total, to help you plan only what is most important. Our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nSMALL, MEDIUM & LARGE TASKS\n\nMuch like a box for sushi, Bento allows you to create small, medium, and large tasks helping you to organize your tasks in sizeable chunks for better completion. The best productivity experts recommend reducing your workload for better per-task performance.\n\n3 ENERGY-BASED WORKFLOWS\n\nOnce you have your 3 priority tasks. We've created 3 workflows, Eat That Frog, Climb The Summit, and the Slow Burn to help you best order your day for success and energy.\n\nSINGLE-TASK FOCUS MODE\n\nTo truly focus, we need fewer distractions. Blocking out attention to focus on just your key task can make a huge difference. Inside Bento, we have a single-task focus mode combined with a countdown timer for deep focus work states.\n\nDARK & LIGHT MODE\n\nEach box can be customized with an emoji alongside stunningly animated themes. Each theme has a light mode and dark mode, for optimal productivity.\n\n6 BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THEMES\n\nRelaxing Japanese-themed backgrounds for a soothing way to handle your most meaningful tasks.\n\n---\n\nBento can be used in a variety of ways, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Create a daily Bento to plan your 3 priority tasks\n- Plan the full week by adding up to 7 Bento boxes\n- Build a week, month, and yearly goals list for planning ahead\n\nThe Bento app is the best and most effective place to implement the Bento Methodology, a new mindful way to approach task management. Bento is now optimised for iPad as part of a single universal app for all your iOS devices.\n\n---\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nReach out on Twitter @BentoMethod or email bento@keepproductive.com for any help.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nFind the full privacy policy here: https://www.bentomethod.com/privacy"

It automatically receives all the calendar events and overlays them on the 12/24 hour dial. This provides a different, more efficient view of your schedule.\n\nHOW IT LOOKS\n\nIt looks like a projection of your calendar of events onto a 12-hour dial that has hour and minute hands just like a regular watch.\nEvent sectors are displayed in those hour intervals in which they will occur.\nThe interval of idle time between events is displayed between sectors, as well as the time from an hour hand to the start of each event.\nEvents are displayed automatically 12/24 hours ahead of time.\n\nThe calendar and analog clock, combined, give a visual representation of your busyness, allow you to effectively plan and calculate daytime.\n\nUse a widget for better integration.\n\nAREAS OF APPLICATION\n\n• Day scheduling and timing. Conveniently track your daily tasks, meetings, events and at any time know how much time is left to wait until the end of the current event and until the start of the next. Don't be late.\n\n• Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in your workplace and you will be completely under control.\n\n• Class schedule. Observe how much time is left before the end of a tiresome lecture at the university and never be late for laboratory work.\n\n• Schedule of the day. Follow your daily routine and get better, just use the app to keep track of your to-dos and daily tasks. Take rest breaks in time!\n\n• Trip timer and flight duration. Are you losing the passage of time due to endless travel and flights? Control check-in time, boarding time and flight duration. Keep everything under control.\n\n• Make your meal, medication, and exercise schedule clearer. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!\n\n• Convenient countdown to scheduled events in the app and widget. The plan of the day will be executed exactly.\n\n• The app may appeal to fans of Pomodoro and Chronodex timer technologies. Time tracking with him will happen in a new way."

      "label": "TaskTask is the easiest way to get your Outlook or Gmail tasks onto your iPhone! TaskTask directly connects with your Office 365 Business, Exchange on-premises, or Google tasks to keep your full task list in sync between Outlook and your device. Everything is tracked, include all the advanced properties you can see in Outlook. Best of all TaskTask includes flagged items (email!) so you can see your complete task list on the go.\n\nUsing TaskTask, you can manage your to-do list, create tasks, set start/due dates, mark complete, assigning categories, change importance, set and receive reminders, and delete tasks. An Exchange Server or Office 365 account is required to synchronized tasks with Outlook. No additional software is necessary. TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "iPinSafe is the perfect solution if you want to take your secret passwords and PIN codes with you on your iPhone or iPod touch. You can enter and maintain the data either with this app, or with the Mac version of iPinSafe (available on the Mac App Store).\n\nThe app stores the information in a very secure way on your iPhone, and only allows access to someone who can reproduce a specific screen gesture, defined by you.\n\nThe program stores the information with strong encryption, using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Therefore, the only way to access the data is by entering a key, which only you know. There is no \"backdoor\" to get to the information!\n\niPinSafe uses a unique approach for entering the key. You do not have to type a password or a secret number; instead the program lets you define a gesture, in the form of a line pattern that you simply draw on the screen. This approach has a number of advantages:\n- It is faster than typing a password.\n- Being a line pattern, the key is easier to remember than a series of letters and digits.\n- The number of possible gestures is huge, so it is virtually impossible to guess the correct one.\n\nThe encryption key is not stored on the device - only you know the personal gesture. So even if you lose the device, the information is safe.\n\nWhile you draw your secret line pattern, it appears in a small area of the screen, and can even be totally hidden if you wish. If you suspect that an unauthorized person saw you drawing the line pattern, you can easily change it.\n\nWhile accessing your confidential data, you can lock the data instantly by simply turning the device face-down. This clears the screen, and you must enter the gesture again to see the data.\n\nThe program also locks the data if the device is tilted or moved quickly - for example if someone unexpectedly grabs it from your hands.\n\niPinSafe keeps track of the number of times a wrong gesture has been entered. The app supports auto-destruct: if a wrong gesture has been entered too many times in a row, the stored data is destroyed. You can configure the maximum number of attempts yourself."

It just notifies you about the interval end and you decide when do you want to continue with the next interval. This is more realistic in a real world scenario as you might need an extra minute or so to complete your current work before you want to go for a break. It is a similar experience as a traditional analog pomodoro timer. Our statistics module can figure out what counts as a set or break, so you still get the same insight and discipline for your focused work. \n\nIf you have any question don't hesitate to reach us at [company@talkingchickenfriend.com](mailto:company@talkingchickenfriend.com)\n\n\"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.\" - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)"

We have got you covered.\n\nWe have dedicated modes inside the app to handle both your PRODUCTIVITY Life and your everyday LIVING.\n \nPRODUCTIVITY, READY.\n\nLife recognises the importance of time management, planning and continuous learning. It has got five different productivity related features to help you get things done.\n \n- TIME 'management.'\nAre you often unable to concentrate on doing one thing because your mobile phone distracts your attention? This kind of problem will now be solved by your new \"LIFE\". The time section offers two different modes, focus/timer, to allow you to toggle between different levels of concentration so you can focus on whatever needs to be done.\n\n- LEARNING 'mate'\nKeep up with your daily readings, and track reading progress as well as writing down any related thoughts, questions, and notes through your bookshelf while enjoying a selection of seven white noises. You can now also stay on top of your learning items by utilising the flashcards that are made available to you. \n1. Export To PDF\n\n- Plan 'daily'\nDon't worry about not having a detailed and reasonable plan anymore. You can now access a much simpler and visually straightforward method for planning your tasks. You can choose to add to-do’s and prioritise between different tasks and set reminders. At the same time, you can see your unfinished and completed tasks all in one clear manner. Additionally, you can start recording down your daily expenses and note down investment records in the wealth section.  By being able to view your spending behaviour and its breakdown by type, you will become more financially aware of your spending pattern! It will be easier to start to organise daily routines from now using Life.\n \nLIVING, APPRECIATED.\n\n- 'Uncluttered' mind\nUse the journal to record everything from a text passage you read in the news or just your inner thoughts or feelings as they come and go. You will never have to leave any significant bit of daily life behind. Start appreciating and reflecting every touch of this Life of yours.\n\n- 'Thankful' soul\nLet even a simple hangout with your best friends be a special moment in your life!  Never again will you miss an important date or an interaction with the ones you cared the most. \n\n- 'Hydrated' body\nLog your daily water intake with Life to stay informed with your daily drinking pattern and consumption level. You will also be able to sync your water intake data with the Health app if you prefer.\n \nYOUR, LIFE.\n\n- 'Work and Life', Integrated.\nTo save you the hustle from interacting with different related components of Life between the ‘PRODUCTIVITY’ and ‘LIVING’ modes, we have implemented ways to link related features or modes across the app to speed up things. Try to create a new interaction record that came with an expense between you and one of your contacts. Once created, you will notice that the costs recorded in the contact's interaction will also be automatically recorded in your budget section at the same time. This kind of linkage will likely be more common in the upcoming future updates.\n \nOTHER, THINGS.\n\n- 'Shake for prophecy'\nWhen you are hesitant about something, you can always quickly shake your phone and listen to a weird cat's opinion. (That is if it is of any use to you.)\n\n-'Daily introduction'\nGet your daily motivation up through daily quotes and important date countdown.\n\n-'?'\n+ Apple Health integration\n? Minimalism\n? No accounts required\n? No subscriptions/ or in app purchases \n! Variety of app icons to choose from, whichever fits with rest of the other apps you got on your Home Screen.\n?

      "label": "Scene Study is an incredibly easy way for actors to learn their lines, memorize scenes and rehearse for theater and film productions. Created by actors for actors, Scene Study frees you from the script to start actively listening and responding in the scene. By recording your cues lines, you practice listening for them right along with recalling your own. \n\nOnce you have a scene set up, save time by rehearsing while doing other activities. Combining other tasks with rehearsal enables deeper memorization of your lines and often provides a few unexpected insights to your character. \n\nGetting started is easy. Simply create a production, add characters, then start recording your character's spoken and cue lines. Record the full lines for your scene partners or just the cue lines. Then start rehearsing!\n\nChoose the character you wish to rehearse by muting them during playback and enjoy your own portable scene partner. Rehearse around the house or on the go, rehearse while driving or doing chores. It’s that easy! \n\nFeatures \n\n- Dress rehearsal mode!\n- Line prompting to speed memorization.\n- Streamlined recording interface.\n- Lock screen audio controls integration.\n- Great for single scene and full length productions.\n- Shared character lists for productions.\n- Streamlined scene screen enables playback and recording from one screen. \n- Playback all scene lines or mute a character to rehearse lines from memory.\n- Drag and drop line reordering.\n- Auto-save recordings for fast scene creation.\n- Headphone and bluetooth support for limitless rehearsal opportunities."

      "label": "Habeets is a simple habit-tracking app designed to help you achieve your goals and create a better version of yourself. If you want to create better habits (workout, eat healthily, save more money, etc), or ditch your bad ones (drinking, smoking, etc), Habeets can help you achieve that. You will still need to do the hard work, though...\n\nCORE VALUES\n- Form or ditch any type of habit\n- Easy to use\n- Packed with all the features you need\n- All your habits are for your eyes only. Neither I nor Apple can read your data.\n- No extra payments, subscriptions, or ads\n- Automatically synchronize your data across all your devices\n- Support for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac (Apple Silicon)\n- Beautifully crafted graphs and insights\n- Dark mode\n- Set reminders\n\n\nMAKE YOUR GOALS A REALITY\nShows how far you've come and how much you've improved. Encourages you to keep going when things get tough. Finally, break those bad habits that have been holding you back for years\n\nSIMPLE, EASY, AND FAST\nHabeets is a straightforward, simple, and elegant solution to help you in your journey, that will become part of your day.\n\nIMPROVE EVERY DAY\nTrack days that you missed or skipped, and make it work next time.\nForm all types of recurring habits: Weekly, Interval, and Customized.\n\nNO EXTRA PAYMENTS\nI believe that helping you achieve your goals is more important than anything else. Nowadays almost every app requires subscriptions or they just have ads everywhere.\nHabeets doesn't have any premium features. You'll receive all features already unlocked. No subscriptions, no additional payments, or ads.\nPay once, and use forever. That's it.\nHelping you become better and better by using this app is what matters to me.\n\nYOUR PRIVACY MATTERS\nHabeets is focused on privacy. We don't track you or your habits. We don't send any data to 3rd parties. Your habits data never leaves your phone or its iCloud backups. None of your habits data is saved to a server (except iCloud's servers).\n\nREMINDERS\nGo mind-free all day setting reminders for your habits. Set up an alarm for when you need to do something important like drink water or meditate. You'll never miss a chance to keep moving forward.\n\nANYTIME. ANYWHERE\nI designed Habeets so you can use it anytime, anywhere. From your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch. This will help you continue your habits wherever you go.\nFor example, you can use your Apple Watch to track habits when your iPhone is not around.\nAll your data is encrypted and automatically synched throught all your devices.\n\n\n\"Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\" - James Clear (Atomic Habits)\n\nThank you for reading until here. I wish you nothing but the best in your journey.\n\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://habeets.com/privacy-policy/"

These brainwave frequencies are in most cases inaudible and therefore must be induced through the use of binaural tones.  In this process two different tones are played, one for one ear, and one for the other (headphones or earbuds must be used).  When processing these two different tones the human brain perceives the difference as a beat matching the target brainwave frequency."

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

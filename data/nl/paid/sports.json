Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

      "label": "This app provides, using temperature, altitude, humidity, atmospheric pressure and your engine configuration, a recommendation about optimal carburetor config (jetting) for karts with IAME X30, Parilla Leopard, X30 Super 175 engines which use a Tillotson or Tryton diaphragm carburetors\n\nValid for the following IAME engine models:\n• X30 Junior - 22mm restrictor (Tillotson HW-27 or Tryton HB-27 carburetors)\n• X30 Junior - 22.7mm restrictor (HW-27 or HB-27)\n• X30 Junior - 26mm header + flex (HW-27 or HB-27)\n• X30 Junior - 29mm header + flex (HW-27 or HB-27)\n• X30 Junior - 31mm header + flex (HW-27 or HB-27)\n• X30 Senior - header + flex (HW-27 or HB-27)\n• X30 Senior - 1-piece exhaust (HW-27 or HB-27)\n• X30 Super 175 (Tillotson HB-10)\n• Parilla Leopard (Tillotson HL-334)\n\nThis app can obtain automatically the position and altitude to get the temperature, pressure and humidity from the nearest weather station through the internet. Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet, in this case the user has to enter weather data manually.\n\n• For each carburetor config, the following values are given: high speed screw position, low speed screw position, pop-off pressure, optimal exhaust length, spark plug, spark plug gap, optimal exhaust temperature (EGT), optimal water temperature\n• Support Kestrel DROP, Kestrel 5x00, WeatherFlow WEATHERmeter, Skywatch BL bluetooth weather stations\n• Fine tuning for high and low speed screws\n• History of all your carburetor configs\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (gasoline with or without ethanol, Racing fuels available, for example: VP C12, VP 110, VP MRX02, Sunoco)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor config will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg atm for pressures\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab high speed screw position, low speed screw position, pop-off pressure, optimal exhaust length, spark plug, spark plug gap, optimal exhaust temperature (EGT), optimal water temperature are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs. This tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all this values to adapt to the concrete engine. Also the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too. On this tab, you can also share your settings with your colleagues. You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of air and fuel (lambda).\n• History: This tab contains the history of all carburetor configs. This tab also contains your favorite carburetor configs.\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, type of restrictor, carburetor, spark manufacturer, fuel type, oil mix ratio\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity). In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. Also, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us."

Do you get bored in the arena and need to help finding new ways to keep both you and your horse entertained?\n\nIf the answer is yes to any of the above then you need the Polework Patterns App by Fancy Footwork Equestrian  in your life! \n\nThis app includes 40 different layouts (20 main and 20 random) which are designed to be multi directional and use between one and twenty poles. There are several unique features including:\n\n- the option to search for layouts based on the amount of poles you want to use:\n   • 1–5 poles\n   • 6–10 poles \n   • 11–15 poles \n   • 16–20 poles \n\n- the option to search for exercises based on what area of a horse’s development you want to focus on – here you will find 15 categories including \n   • Balance \n   • Core \n   • Engagement \n   • Response to rider \n   • ... and more!\n\n- a random button which can be used if you can’t decide which layout to go for, or if you like to live a little dangerously! Either way press that random button, watch the poles spin, the confetti fall and then marvel as your layout is revealed! \n\n- all of the layouts have different suggested exercises to use (four options for the main layouts and two options for the random layouts), each of which are colour-coded to show which pace to use, and a proposed difficulty rating attached to help you decide if that exercise is suitable to your horse’s stage of training.\n\n- 120 potential exercises with four suggestions given per exercise as to what areas it could help your horse improve on. (Flexibility, straightness etc) \n\n- a “Favourites” folder where you can add any of the 80 exercises used in the main layouts for quick and easy access.\n\nPolework patterns was developed by the creator of Fancy Footwork Equestrian, Nina Gill. Nina is a qualified coach who runs Polework clinics full-time and is passionate about her work and the many benefits of polework. This passion has led to Fancy Footwork Equestrian collaborating with some of the U.K.’s biggest equestrian YouTubers and influencers, as well as having Polework training articles printed in three of the biggest equine magazines to date. \nWith this app you will never run out of Polework ideas, even the biggest layouts have been designed to be broken down into smaller sections so that those sections can be used as a standalone layout if you don’t have enough poles to build the whole thing."

You are already at a disadvantage because you lose concentration while arithmetic and have to start again.\nThe Darts Checkout Trainer helps you to gradually learn all common checkouts from 41 to 170 by heart.\nAnd if you prefer a different finish route than suggested by the app for a checkout, you can edit the stored checkout table at any time and save your preferred routes.\nIn a real match, you can also use the app as a checkout table! The app always shows you your current favorite checkout.\nYou can also use the app as a clear checkout table! \nMake sure to try out the widgets \"Checkout of the day\" and \"Checkout table\"!\nDo you have to write on a scoreboard at a league game again? Or are you playing on a board with a friend and there is no app available? With this app you can practice \"calculating by hand\"!\n\nIn addition to the mental training, there will be more and more practical games on the board over time. 501, Around the clock and Bob's 27 are the hottest new games. Get accurate on every single segment of the board and push your double hit rates!\n\nAnd very important: The app is optimized for both iPhones and iPads.

An overview of the current list of courses can be found at courses.expertgolf.com. \n\nWhy Expert Golf is better\n▸ User-friendly and intuitive operation (a manual is superfluous).\n▸ The first score card in the world that can be signed on the touchscreen.\n▸ More precise data thanks to professional mapping.\n▸ Database updated daily.\n▸ Support 365 days a year.\n▸ No advertising pop-ups at all.\n▸ Excellent customer ratings and top rankings in the App Store.\n▸ Leading app for many years and improved with regular updates.\n\nIncluding updates for one year. (Note: Expert Golf is NOT a subscription. The annual fee will not automatically be charged again after the year has ended. You can continue to use the app without renewing the service, you will just no longer be able to download any new courses from the database.)\n\nFAQ – Why Expert Golf charges an annual fee\nEach year approximately 15% of golf courses are redesigned or newly built or the order of their holes is changed etc. This means that the database has to be constantly maintained and updated. Only with an annual fee concept will you be guaranteed access to up-to-date and comprehensive data that you can trust on a long-term basis. Providers that only charge a once-only payment for their app will sooner or later stop maintaining their data.\n\nExpert Golf is the only app that puts everything a player needs on a round of golf onto the iPhone. It comprises a total of four modules including “iGolfrules” – one of the world’s most popular sport apps that has been in the App Store top ten continually for many years and is officially recommended by Apple. You can add the following additional modules to your app (charges apply)\n▸ GPS caddie \n▸ Golf rules\n▸ Golf tips\n\nIf you are happy with our app we would be grateful if you would take a moment of your time to post a rating/ write a review in the App Store.\nIf, for whatever reason, you are not happy with the app or have any questions about it please contact our support team at support@expertgolf.com."

Clever.”\n▸ EXTRA GOLF wrote: “The undisputed no. 1 golf app.”\n▸ GOLF JOURNAL wrote: “A real must for golfers who own an iPhone.”\n▸ GOLFERS ONLY wrote: “The perfect virtual caddie. Recommendation: Buy.”\n\nOn the basis of state-of-the-art GPS technology, the GPS Caddie from Expert Golf sends the exact distance to the green directly to your display – with an accuracy of 1-3 meters. You can also measure the length of your shots (e.g. drives). The distances are permanently available to be read off the display, without any user interaction (no aiming necessary and you do not have to be able to see the flag). This is facilitated by a vast database containing the GPS coordinates of the golf courses.\nThe accuracy of the data is of utmost importance to Expert Golf. Therefore highly-accurate data is collected in cooperation with the national surveying and topography offices and other government agencies – as opposed to most other providers whose apps are based on free aerial imagery and who thus tolerate discrepancies of tens of meters. \nThe database is updated and extended daily. An overview of the courses already mapped is available at courses.expertgolf.com. \n\nWhy Expert Golf is better\n▸ User-friendly and intuitive operation (a manual is superfluous).\n▸ More precise distance information thanks to mapping by professional surveyors.\n▸ Virtually no roaming charges (no need to download aerial photos).\n▸ No network coverage required (the app only uses the free GPS signal).\n▸ No advertising pop-ups.\n▸ Database updated daily.\n▸ Support 365 days a year.\n▸ Excellent customer ratings and top rankings in the App Store.\n▸ Leading app for many years and improved with regular updates.\n\n100% RULES COMPLIANT! The use of iPhones as distance measuring devices has been permitted in tournaments since 1.1.2014, on the condition that distance measuring devices are allowed in the Local Rules. (Please note: Many GPS apps give advice on club selection and are therefore banned. However “Expert Golf” complies with the rules as per the R&A.)\n\nIncluding updates for one year. (Note: Expert Golf is NOT a subscription. The annual fee will not automatically be charged again after the year has ended. You can continue to use the app without renewing the service, you will just no longer be able to download any new courses from the database.)\n\nFAQ – Why Expert Golf charges an annual fee\nEach year approximately 15% of golf courses are redesigned or newly built or the order of their holes is changed etc. This means that the database has to be constantly maintained and updated. Only with an annual fee concept will you be guaranteed access to up-to-date and comprehensive data that you can trust on a long-term basis. Providers that only charge a once-only payment for their app will sooner or later stop maintaining their data.\n\nExpert Golf is the only app that puts everything a player needs during a round of golf onto the iPhone. It comprises a total of four modules including “iGolfrules” – one of the world’s most popular sport apps that has been in the App Store top ten continually for many years and is officially recommended by Apple. You can add the following additional modules to your app (charges apply)\n▸ Score card & Stableford calculator\n▸ Golf rules\n▸ Golf tips\n\nIf you are happy with our app we would be grateful if you would take a moment of your time to post a rating/ write a review in the App Store.\nIf, for whatever reason, you are not happy with the app or have any questions about it please contact our support team at support@expertgolf.com."

      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

      "label": "Keep track of your players' time on the field with Coach's Clock.\n\nDesigned with input from a youth soccer coach who manages multiple teams each season, Coach's Clock is a very simple application that runs on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. It keeps track of all of the players on your team, where they are supposed to be on the field, and how long they've been playing since they were last substituted into the game.\n\nJust enter in your team name and your player roster. Drag your players on and off the field and tap the clock to start it running. Players on the field accrue elapsed time. Players off the field do not. It's that simple.\n\nWhat Coach's Clock does:\n\n* It tracks how much time has elapsed in the current play period.\n* It tracks the position of every player on your team.\n* It keeps track of how long each player has been on the field.\n* It helps you plan player substitutions.\n* It has field backgrounds for basketball, field hockey, football, hockey and soccer but it could also be used for any similar sport.\n* It supports an unlimited number of teams.\n* It has detailed usage instructions right inside the app.\n* It's a \"universal app\" so one purchase is good for all your iDevices!\n\nWhat it doesn't do:\n\n* Coach's Clock doesn't force you to keep the app running throughout your game. You are free to close it, open other apps, take phone calls, or whatever you like. You only need to run it when you want to refer to it or when you need to make a change. The clocks keep time even when the app isn't running.\n* Coach's Clock is not a replacement for your whiteboard or playbook. (There are plenty of other fine apps which can do that for you.)\n\nCoach's Clock may seem like a pretty simple app, and it is! But that's the beauty of it. It doesn't try to do everything for you; instead it tries to do a few essential things very well. It doesn't try to change the way you coach your team; it just makes your job a little easier."

It records all types of sensor data provided by your iPhone/iPod/iPad (or external sensors), combines them, and makes them available to optimize your drive. Over time, you will get insights on your car and in your driving, not known before.\n\nLapTimer offers more than 1300 predefined tracks world wide. With its assistants, it is extremely easy to setup - just click your track and drive. It fully automates your lap timing using GPS, and presents the results to all kinds of media.\n\nYou are not limited to track driving only. For example, you may define your home and working locations as a 'track', collect statistics on different ways chosen, and analyze / optimize the time used every day. \n\nWant to show your drive to your friends? LapTimer Petrolhead and above generates beautiful in car video recordings with all kinds of data overlaid, ready to be presented - e.g. on youtube. Even without video, recorded data can be analyzed using purpose designed views, making it easy to analyze and improve your driving performance.\n\nUsing online racing, you can use LapTimer in competition. LapTimer offers a Hall of Fame, allows watching you and your friends on track - all in real time.

LapTimer itself comes in three different editions: LapTimer Rookie is the entry level with all you need for lap timing; LapTimer Petrolhead is the advanced version including lots of video features, and LapTimer Grand Prix is the edition for professionals including Multi Cam recording, Health Kit integration, and advanced sensor and analytics functionality. \n\nPlease note that functionality depends on your device, the LapTimer edition chosen, and sometimes even external sensors added (like OBD II). Please visit our web page to get the full story. All edition can be upgraded later, all editions come with native iPhone and iPad support. \n\nThere are quite expensive stand alone solutions for track days available. Be smart and own the leading edge tool simply by using your iPhone and LapTimer. Besides the professional area, there is no known solution that offers more functionality than LapTimer does - across the market. As our ambition is to offer the best tool, LapTimer is enhanced continuously.\n\nPlease visit http://www.gps-laptimer.de for detailed information on versions, FAQs / documentation, in depth technology background information, online racing, and supported device configurations.

Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "SkyDroid - Golf GPS gives you your distance to every green on the course and more. Golf GPS that is easy to use, has a beautiful design, and there are no subscription, usage or course download fees.\n\nWe have over 30,000 courses available, with new courses being added every day of the year. You can view the entire course list on our website: www.skydroid.net. \n\nAdd new courses (if yours is missing) to our system using our web based Course Mapper tool (see skydroid.net for details and tutorial). \n\nFeel free to contact us with questions (contact@skydroid.net)\n\nNote: See our usage note below for help on searching for courses.\n\nFEATURES:\n• Clean and Clear design\n\n• Distances to the front, center and back of every green on the course\n\n• Distances to course features (water hazards, bunkers, target points)\n\n• Satellite image of every green and course\n\n• Shot Tracking: Track the distance of your drives!\n\n• Find your distance to ANY point on the course.\n\n• GPS Accuracy indicator (tap at anytime to find your exact accuracy)\n\n• Distances in yards or meters\n\n• Auto Hole advance\n\n• Works Internationally!!\n\n• Audio updates to the center of the green.  A great hands-free way to use SkyDroid.\n\n• Book discounted tee times directly through SkyDroid.\n\nNo other fees are involved, and you can download as many courses you want without any other charges. \n\nWith SkyDroid – Golf GPS, our simple-to-use design will have you spending your time on your golf game, not on clicking buttons. \n\nView all our courses at www.skydroid.net/courses.php\n\nView our FAQ at www.skydroid.net/faq.php\n\n\nUSAGE NOTES:\n\n• SEARCHING for Courses: When searching for courses by name, you can just search for \"Aug\" instead of \"Augusta National Golf Course\" (leave out the quote marks).\n\n• SEARCHING for Courses: Radar button will find Mapped courses within 25mi/40km of your current location.\n\n• To save battery power, click your power button to turn off the screen when not in use.\n\n• Set your GPS Keep Alive in the SkyDroid settings to control how long GPS stays active when SkyDroid is in the background. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n• GPS accuracy can vary over time (click the GPS signal strength icon at any time to see your accuracy).\n\n• Before playing a course preview its mapping by clicking the link for the course name at www.skydroid.net/courses.php (best done using a large screen). Let us know of any mapping issues, or make changes yourself.\n\n• If we don’t have your course, you can add it as long as there is a satellite image of the course available in Course Mapper.\n\n• Change distance measurement (yards/meters) in the app Settings available on the in-app Menu.\n\n• While playing golf you will only incur data usage while using the Satellite View screen. Course downloads can be done at home over Wi-Fi and are small in size.\n\nEnjoy your round!!"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

Prolonged writing to a flash drive shortness its life span.\n\n+ PRIVACY\nThe app does not in any way collect or send private data or require login. The app is self contained working on your device without any need to contact other services or use internet connection.\n\n\n\nWHAT CRITICS SAY (WITH VIDEO):\n\n[Professional physical education teacher Jarrod Robinson]\n\n“Over the years, I’ve spoken to thousands of PhysEd teachers about the app BaM Video Delay. It’s a complete game-changer that takes what used to be possible with expensive and complicated systems and makes it a reality for everyone”\n\nhttps://thepegeek.com/2016/03/raising-bar-bam-video-delay/\n\n\n[australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org]\n\n“The app has great potential to be used on a regular basis in physical education classes as a formative assessment tool.”\n\nhttp://australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org/2015/11/11/formative-assessment-using-bam-video-delay-app-in-pe/\n\n\n\nUSER REVIEWS:\n\nBy Kbone2000\n5/5 Great app!\nEvery coach needs this app. Immediate feedback for players and a great way for self analysis.\n\nBy James McDermott\n5/5 Great app!\nWorks for what I need, nice that you can have a delay rather than asking someone to record each time.\n\nBy awholelottatry\n5/5 A great technical training tool for sport and fitness\nThis is exactly what I was looking for! Needed it to perfect technique in Crossfit Olympic lifting. Every technical sport could use this valuable tool.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nEver wanted to learn a new move? \nBe it for professional dancing, gymnastics, golf, basketball, tennis, martial arts, breakdance, strike a pose or other use.\n\nA mirror is nice but it's hard to move and look the same time, sometimes even impossible when not facing forward. \n\nA video camera is OK but it is a hassle with all the start, stop, rewind, positioning and other.\n \nSo in the end you don't use either, give up on learning something new and move on with your life.\n\n\n\"Bust a Move Video Delay\" solves these problems.\nIt gives you an easy to use tool with quick feedback. You see what you just did, so you can correct it, try again, look again, correct ... and so on.\n\nAlso, after the initial setup, no interaction is needed so you can focus on training without any distractions.  \n\n\n\nSO WHAT DOES A “VIDEO DELAY” DO ?\n\nIt continuously shows you what just happened seconds ago. There is no alternating record or play phase, just continuous playback but with a given delay. This way you get fast and easy accessible video feedback. \n\nAlso no tapping, rewinding or other interactions are needed. Once set up it works hands free so you can focus on your moves.\n\nNow there are just two easy steps:\n1. BUST A MOVE\n(do what you want to learn)\n2. LOOK & LEARN\n(see what you just did and what's wrong)\n\nThis way you get instantaneous feedback so you can quickly learn on your mistakes and get better in no time. \n\n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- \"hands free\" continuous playback but with a delay\n- up to Full HD at 30 fps and HD at 60 fps\n- universal app for both iPhone/iPod and iPad\n- delays from 1 second up to 6 minutes\n- uses device memory instead of its flash drive\n- up to 4 independent views so you can see yourself 4 times in a row\n- slow motion and pause to analyse the video\n- export as video\n- AirPlay and HDMI TV cable support\n- auto hiding interface controls\n- \"Live View\" for easy positioning of the camera and setup\n- front to rear camera switch\n- horizontal flip\n- x2 Zoom with panning\n- exposure and focus setting\n- and a manual, just in case"

      "label": "CrewNerd turns your cell phone into an on-the-water training tool in any rowing shell, canoe, kayak or dragon boat - with no wiring! With a waterproof case, you can get real-time data during your workout and even relay it to your coach.\n\nUsing the accelerometer in your device, CrewNerd is able to accurately calculate your stroke rate as well as how much bounce (vertical movement) and stern check you are producing.  Speed, pace and distance are calculated via GPS.\n\n• Configurable display\n\nIn landscape mode there are up to six configurable data fields, and in portrait mode there are up to ten. Choose from the following:\n  • Stroke rate\n  • Elapsed time\n  • Distance\n  • Speed or pace\n  • Average speed or pace\n  • Heart rate\n  • Stroke count\n  • Interval count\n  • Meters per stroke\n  • Total distance\n  • Projected time and distance\n  • Check\n  • Bounce\n  • Course (direction)\n  • Time of day\n\nSet the top line to be double-height to make the most important data stand out. In portrait mode, the top two lines can both be made double-height.\n\n• Custom workouts\n\nSelect from one of the provided workouts, or create your own based on distance, time or strokes.  An auto-start feature starts the timer when the first stroke is taken, or you can set a “countdown” of 15 or 30 seconds before the timer starts to allow you to build up speed before starting a piece.\n\n• Custom courses\n\nCreate custom by plotting your start and finish lines on a map. The application will start the timer automatically when you cross the start line and stop when you reach the finish. This is great for hands free operation in long distance races or for set routes you routinely use.\n\n• Review your data\n\nAll workout data is recorded and can be reviewed on the device or uploaded directly to Strava, Concept2, TrainingPeaks, Sportlyzer, or the Apple Health app. On the history page for your practice, press \"Select export type\" to choose one of these options.\n\nYou can also export data as GPX, KML, TCX, or CSV. You can view a map of your workout or view an interval data chart with configurable distance markers showing split times on your phone.\n\n• Heart rate\n\nCrewNerd supports all Bluetooth Smart heart rate monitors.\n\n• Live position tracking\n\nStream your workout data as it happens to any web browser via CrewNerd.com.\n\n• VoiceOver support\n\nFor blind and vision-impaired athletes, CrewNerd provides audible feedback during your workouts. Configure the content and timing of the announcements to meet your needs.\n\n• For coaches\n\nUse custom workouts to keep your practices on target. In coach mode, you can tap anywhere on the screen to check stroke rate. CrewNerd can also be used on the iPad for a larger display.\n\nWaterproof cases are available to protect your iPhone on the water. See our web site for more information."

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Have you ever wanted to maintain your bike yourself? \n\nBike Doctor 2.0 has been created to make bicycle maintenance as simple as possible. \n\nNot everyone is a technically minded bike mechanic. Sometimes, reading the instructions for a bike repair, it can feel that way. That's why we've designed Bike Doctor to be as easy to follow as possible. Making it suitable even for a complete beginner. It is an app I wish I had available to me, when I first started cycling. \n\nUsing the step by step instructions you will: \n◆ Save money on bike shop repairs (Even a simple puncture repair in a bike shop costs upwards of $15) \n◆ Know how to detect problems \n◆ Repair any issues that arise, such as squeaks and poor performance \n◆ Learn how to safety check your bike to be sure it is always ready to ride \n◆ Keep your bike running smoothly for years to come \n\nInside the Bike Doctor app you'll discover: \n◆ How to repair and prevent punctures \n◆ How to detect if your brake pads are worn out and replace them (Including Disk Brakes) \n◆ How to clean your bike \n◆ How to lubricate your bike \n◆ The 7 rookie bicycle maintenance mistakes you should avoid \n◆ How to adjust your headset \n◆ How to wrap handlebar tape \n◆ How to adjust your gears \n◆ How to true a bicycle wheel \n◆ How to fit a new chain and rear cassette(A very common yearly repair!) \n◆ How to bleed disk brakes \n◆ How to remove and replace a bottom bracket \n◆ How to replace brake and gear cables \n◆ And that's just scratching the surface! We've got all the most common repairs in the app and we're constantly asking for feedback from users of our app to discover what repairs they would like added - and then adding these in. \n\nBike Doctor 2.0 is the new version of the original best-selling Bike Doctor. The original version has been downloaded over 10,000 times and received coverage in some of the most popular cycling magazines including Bicycling and Cycling Plus. \n\nThe Bicycle is the ultimate in independence - learn how to keep yours maintained and in tip-top condition to insure it is always ready to get you to your destination! \n\nHere are some of the many 5 star reviews we've received: \n\"I'm over the moon with this app I read somewhere about truing wheels and it said don't bother unless you are a pro, but I've just sorted my wheels out a treat. The app paid for itself straight away.\" \n\"Great app, worth every penny saved money on a service already !!!!\" \n\"This is a good App for the keen cyclist, as a Cytech technician I recommend this App.\" \n\"Excellent application with some nice clear photos. Explanations are concise but personal, the writer has a passion for cycling and it shows, which makes for a refreshing experience.\" \n\"Very comprehensive explanations, great photos, easy to use.\" \n\nBike Doctor has been created by Andreas Kambanis of London's most popular cycling blog: londoncyclist.co.uk. \n\nFor a video of the Bike Doctor App in action please head to bikedoctorapp.com"

      "label": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year. There is a 2 weeks free trial period.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to SprintTimer Pro, the purchase will be charged to your Apple ID account. The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the period. You can manage it from the user settings in iTunes after purchasing it, and you will also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there.\n\nIf you purchase a new SprintTimer Pro subscription during a free trial you will forfeit any free trial remaining from your first subscription.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy: https://sprinttimer.se/privacy\n\n\nIcon runners made by Freepik from Flaticon.com"

      "label": "Who's On-Field Hockey helps youth-field-hockey coaches manage who's on the field and who's going on next.\n\nIt has been developed for the iPhone and iPad with experienced coaches who find managing rotations and balancing play time awkward and stressful.\n\nWatch our feature videos at \"http://whos-on.leftcoastlabs.biz/videos/fieldhockey\".\n\n\nWhat coaches have said about Who's On apps...\n    \n\"It's intuitive and easy of use.\"\n\n\"It can handle all the unpredictability of coaching youth sports. For instance, I don't know who's going to be there [on game day] until I show up at the game. Players sometimes show up late or leave early. Young players decide at the last minute that they don't want to go on, messing up my planned rotation. This app allows me to handle all this... with ease.\"\n \n\"I like how clearly each player's name, number and picture is presented on the screen. I have a lousy memory and remembering new player names at the start of a season is always a problem for me.\"\n\n\"The 1-touch Position History is really well done... I wouldn't want to coach again without it!\"\n\n\"I love how easy it is to add player photos to the team.\"\n\n\nFeature Summary:\n\nSimple drag and drop - With Who's On-Field Hockey, you simply drag player icons from the \"bench\" to \"field positions\" as you make decisions for your starting lineup or substitutions. The app remembers \"who\" you've assigned \"where\" and tracks how long each player has been in each position during the game.\n\n1-screen game information - All game-time information is displayed clearly on one screen (as shown in the screen shots). Bright yellow banners clearly indicate where you've pre-assigned substitutes for your next rotation.\n\n1-button rotation - When it's time to make substitutions, you press one button to indicate that the subs have taken the field and the app records this event. The app then places the icons of the players coming off the field back on the bench ready for their next rotation assignments.\n\nBuilt-in substitution timer - A built-in timer can be used to balance rotation times.\n\nPress-and-hold play history (a unique and celebrated feature of Who's On-Field Hockey) – By simply dragging a player's icon to the bottom of the screen, the display will change to show a Position History (graphically indicating where the player has played and for how long).\n\nHot-Cold Indicators - shows which players have significantly more or less play time than the average.  Players with significantly more play time are highlighted red (Hot).  Similarily, blue (Cold) for less play time.\n\nSimple score tracking – Tap the scoreboard and quickly add goals and record who scored and who assisted.  All scoring information is automatically stored with the game for post-game review.\n\nFast team setup - We've built Who's On-Field Hockey to allow you to enter a team's information quickly. Typically it only takes a few minutes to enter all your team's information.\n\n1-touch player pictures - Capture player pictures with the app's integrated camera function. 1-touch, point and click.\n\nMultiple teams - If you coach or assist with two or more teams, this app supports multiple teams. Simply select the team you want to use from the team list and your ready to go.\n\nFlexible field formations - Who's On-Field Hockey supports any field formation. Changing field positions is just another drag and drop activity. You simply \"unlock\" the field, move, add or remove positions and then \"lock\" the field. The app will remember the last formation you used for each team you coach.\n\nGame / Practice schedules - Who's On-Field Hockey let's you store your team's schedule in your phone if you desire. \n\nGame data and notes - Use game notes to track pre-game thoughts and reminders as well as post-game comments.  All game data is stored in the team's schedule and game stats can be reviewed at any time or sent to the team's record keeper via email. \n\n\nSupported platforms:\n - built for iPhone or iPod Touch\n - runs on iPad as iPhone app"

      "label": "OVERVIEW\n\nHarry's Sailor is a GPS based navigation tool / sailing companion. Like all apps from Harry's GPS Suite it uses an advanced GPS Engine developed and maintained for a decade. For this Sailor app, the engine was expanded for the specific situation on a ship. One example for this expansion is treatment of speed. GPS is weak delivering exact speed informations at low vessel speeds making it necessary to utilize special algorithms.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThis version brings a number of unique features to the iPhone platform. Examples are: visualization and measurement of heeling including a visual alarm when heeling in larger that 20 / 25 degree; display of racing rule #10: when boats are on opposite tacks, a port-tack boat shall keep clear of a starboard-tack boat; full navigation support, course can be defined using polar coordinates, defined waypoints, or using a course given; full integration of Google Maps; while navigation is started, deviation from course, distance to waypoint, and velocity made good (VMG) is displayed continuously; extensive reference on nautic information: signal flags, morse code, buoyages, lights and shapes, wind speed; finally, a full trip recorder including statistics, ports visited, and Google Earth export. \n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nSailor requires an iOS device featuring GPS. In case you want to use an iPod touch, an external GPS mouse needs to be added. Compatible devices are listed on www.gps-laptimer.de/compatibility/ios."

But there are products out there, where you can put your iDevice into, to make it waterproof and still be able to operate it. In this way you can either mount it near your other instruments on your keelboat or strap it to your arm if you are sailing a dinghy.\n\nFeatures:\n\nMain View.\nHere you can see your 4 most important readouts, fore instance Heading, Speed, VMG and Performance.\n\nThere also is a lift indicator, showing you if you have been lifted by a wind shift, and graphs showing the development in your speed and VMG over a configurable amount of time and a permormance bar.\n\nWind direction.\nSet your wind direction by storing your heading while sailing on upwind on starboard and port tack, or simply type it in.\n\nStart view.\nHere you have your count down (including sync), and you can mark your starting line and iRegatta will calculate the distance to the line and indicate the favorite line end, if wind direction is set.\n\nStatistics view.\nView your current position and trip odometer and max speed since last reset. You'll also see a polar diagram with your speed and VMG (wind speed dependent).\n\nWaypoints.\nNavigate to your favorite pre-stored waypoints, or create a new temporary waypoint by cross bearing using the iPhone internal camera, or by distance/bearing.\n\nTracking.\nRecord your track and view it on the map or export it for further analysis to your computer.\n\nInstead of internal GPS you can get instrument information over WiFi from NMEA0183 instruments. \n\nAIS data received over WiFi will be displayed in a Radar-like view.\n\niRegatta also comes with a watch app, which will allow you to view data on your watch as well as operate the start line features. Besides that, the watch app will track your sailing as an activity and help you close your activity circles using HealthKit..\n\nRead more detailed information on the apps web page."

      "label": "Dive Plan is a digital decompression table and log book, made using general public information, most compatible with PADI, SSI, SDI, NAUI, NAVI diving tables, and it is comparable with most of the other current diving organizations and their dive tables. Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

Manage and organize multiple teams fairly and efficiently, with less stress and more time to enjoy the truly rewarding experience that being a Soccer Dad brings. Click “...More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\nBest soccer app - *****\nby Ciaran O'Shaughnessy - Dec 11, 2010\n\n\"I have downloaded and tried maybe 15 or more apps to help manage games, players (rotations, time played etc) and track stats for players on my Recreational and Club team.\nWhile there are probably 3 that are worthwhile. One is good and has 90% of what I needed, but is not user friendly and difficult to use. The second is great and easy to use, but only has 80% of what I needed. This app has 99% of what anyone needs, is easy to use and is user friendly. In addition the developer is quick to respond and eager to find out what else would improve the product.\nI would have given this 10 stars as a rating, but unfortunately 5 is the most one can give.\"\n\nThe whistle blows and your team springs into action. As you watch them play, you can’t help but feel proud of those kids. They’ve come so far since the beginning of this year’s soccer season. Thankfully, as their coach, you have, too.\n\nWhen you first started coaching kids’ soccer, you manually made up schedules, juggled rotations, organized events and volunteers. You did it all, including reports and communicating with parents. It was a lot of work but seeing the kids improve and grow was satisfying and worth all that effort. Sadly, it didn’t give you much time to enjoy your role as much as you were hoping.\n\nThanks to the Soccer Dad app, you can now take care of all your team’s administration needs in a much easier way. You’ll be so organized and efficient, that you’ll enjoy coaching even more. Communicating with parents and players is a breeze too, because the app holds the full contact information of everyone you may need to get in touch with.\n\nEver need to schedule or reschedule games and practices? Of course you do. No problem, Soccer Dad can help you with that and will even mark the dates on your built-in iPhone calendar. You also have the option of having Soccer Dad issue reminders about those dates. \n\nJust look at how Soccer Dad can help you and your team:\n* Fairly and efficiently manage and organize multiple teams by season\n* Easy access of player contact information – quickly communicate with parents\n* Organize events and have them display in your iPhone calendar\n* Keep track of volunteers\n* Replace your stopwatch and clipboard – lets you know when it’s time to change players, even if it’s in your pocket.\n* Send emails without ever leaving the app\n* Use the camera and photo library for player pictures\n* Optimized for the iPhone and iPad retina display\n\nIf you’re one of those special people who coaches kids’ soccer, let this helper app make the season and administrative tasks a little more comfortable and less labor intensive. Then you’ll have time for what’s truly important – the kids.\n\nDownload Soccer Dad now.\n\nSee this App in action here:  http://www.youtube.com/soccerdadapp\n\n- Support -\n\nIf you have questions/issues/feedback regarding the app, please contact me through my support link below.\n\n(Unfortunately, I can't respond to App Store reviews because there's no way to contact reviewers.)"

      "label": "Ratio Calc is a quick and easy tool for radio control car racers to use trackside. Knowing your final drive ratio (FDR) is very useful for comparison with other racers to determine if your car is geared correctly. You can also view your favourite information on Apple Watch.\n\nIt lets you quickly select your car by filtering on manufacturer and model. Select your pinion and spur size and the FDR is displayed. Tyre diameter can also be entered to calculate your rollout. \n\nRatio and roll out charts are also available which plot pinion and spur gear combinations to create very handy reference tables. \n\n- Save your favourite cars for quick access\n\n- Save notes and track name against your favourite cars\n\n- Share ratio/rollout charts\n\n- Download new cars from within the app\n\n- Select measurement units (imperial/metric)\n\n- Select your preferred gear pitch, alternative ratios in other pitches will be shown\n\n- Over 1600 cars/variants in the database"

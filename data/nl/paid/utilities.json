      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

      "label": "***THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVER SIDE SERVICE***\n\nQuantumult is a powerful proxy client.\n• Right now supports protocol Shadowsocks(r), HTTP, HTTP over TLS, SOCKS5 and SOCKS5 over TLS, VMess.\n\nIt can capture all the TCP traffic and redirect under you own way by using Filter function.\n• The filter has a few types to match. For TCP traffic that has the upper layer protocol HTTP(S), 'HOST', 'HOST-SUFFIX', 'HOST-KEYWORD', 'USER-AGENT', 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are all supported. For the other TCP traffic, 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are supported. Especially, when deal with HTTP(S) traffic, Quantumult has another function called Rejection, it matchs the whole URL of the HTTP(S) request.\n• After match, the filter has a lot of actions to deal with the request, built-in policy 'DIRECT', 'REJECT', 'PROXY', all your servers and your customized policies. Actually you can see all the actions as a lot of paths and you can decide which request goes through which path by using filter function.\n\nMore over, Quantumult can be a convenient web develop tool on mobile device.\n• When you on the road without the Mac platform debug tools like Charles and Wireshark, you still can use Quantumult to log parts of the web request to debug some web issues.\n• Quantumult can log all the HTTP(S) request header and response header.\n• Yes, you are right it can log the HTTPS request header and response header, be sure to install and trust Quantumult root CA for this advanced function.\n\nSince quantumult has a function called PROXY, sure it can redirect your traffic to remote proxy servers. But be clear, we do NOT provide any server side service or support, you should build your own servers.\n• Like we said early Quantumult can redirect all TCP traffic through the filter function, that means you can visit different web site through different servers by the filter. See it can accelerate your network connection if you set your filter right, and of course the filter is totally customizable.\n• About the customized policy, there are 3 different types of customized policy, 'SSID', 'Latency' and 'Static'. The 'SSID' policy depends on your network enviroment, Wi-Fi, Cellular or specific Wi-Fi with the SSID your provided. The 'Latency' policy is based on the latencies of all the servers of the policy settings, the result is the shortest(The test interval has the option of 600 or 1200 seconds). The 'Static' policy is based on your manual selection of servers or other polices from the policy settings. Sure you are right, some of polices can wrap other polices, convinent, right ?\n\nAbout working state, Quantumult can work in 3 state, 'GLOBAL', 'DIRECT' AND 'AUTO'.\n• The GLOBAL state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic through the built-in PROXY policy(you need build and add your server first).\n• The DIRECT state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic directly to the destination web site. How this state useful ? Yes, it can be a simple web develop tools by analizing the reqeust header and response header including HTTPS.\n• The AUTO state, we call it auto because it base on the filter you set to divide the TCP traffic through different paths, like the popular ACL way.\n\nExtra, Quantumult can also work as a HTTP proxy server for devices under the same Wi-Fi, when this function is turned on, the home view will show the IP and port for other device easily to connect.\n\n\nAt last, some attentions.\n• About the location on the map of home view. It is not the real location in the real world, it's just the IP location and might not be correct."

      "label": "Measuring sound is what we do. Now, on the iPhone and iPod touch. NoiSee - Worthy of the name \"Sound Level Meter\"\n\nNoiSee is an intuitive professional-grade sound level meter for iPhone and iPod touch. It features all the tools that are expected from a professional ANSI or IEC compliant Sound Level meter. All filters, averaging modes and statistics meet or exceed class 2 requirements of relevant ANSI and IEC standards . NoiSee is specifically tailored to meet needs of Occupational health measurements. The application was created by the team that has over 10 years experience in calibration, owning a Sound Level Meter calibration laboratory meeting the ISO 17025 requirements. The same calibration equipment was used for the development of this app.\n\n*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***\n\nThe app has been developed to run on devices running iOS 10 or higher. After you install the app you can start measuring immediately using the internal microphone. The readings you get are as accurate as it gets, because we tested the app with different iPhone models and take into account the differences in microphones between different generations of iPhones. Our tests have shown that the internal microphone has better performance than the microphone on the factory provided in-ear headphones.\n\nThe initial calibration works incredibly well and is determined with testing in an anechoic chamber meant for calibration of professional Sound Level Meters. We do not recommend changing the initial calibration since we have established that the internal sensitivity of the microphones has insignificant variation between different iPhone models.\n\nThe app makes full use of the iPhone's dynamic range which is approximately 45 dB to 100 dB (re. 20 uPa) and frequency response range which is from 100 Hz to 8 kHz.\n\nApp has two modes:\n\n***Sound Level Meter\n\nHistory view for one minute time log of the measured parameter\n\nParameters offers a view of all the Statistics of the current measurement (Percentiles from the ISO)\n-All relevant time weightings available: Fast and Slow\n-All relevant sound measurement parameters are measured and indicated: Leq, LCpeak, SPL\n\nSpectrum view offers a view of time-history of the sound Level which is frequency and time-weighted. \nSpecial care has been taken to design the CPB (Constant percentage bandwidth) frequency analysis according to the IEC 61260 and ANSI S1.11.\n\n***Noise at work\n\nOccupational Health compliant parameters including: Noise DOSE, Elapsed time.\nSpecial parameters: LEX 8h, Projected DOSE, Time to reach 100% DOSE (in hh:mm:ss).\n\n***Settings\n\n- Sound Level meter weightings (Frequency weighting, Time weighting)\n- Noise at work parameters (Standard, Exchange rate, Time Weighting)\n- Microphone selection\n- Calibration\n\n***External microphone\n\nNoiSee has been tested with external microphone MicW i436, which is a calibrated measurement microphone complying with the Class 2 (IEC 61672) sound level meter standard. If you use an acoustic calibrator with a 1/4-inch adapter, NoiSee can perform automatic calibration.\n\n***Sleek app design that is specially appropriate for any light conditions."

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

      "label": "TslaMirror for iOS \nTslaMirror is an App that will help your iPhone App mirroring to Tesla vehicle! Also, it can support App screencast to a Chrome browser.\n\nFor Tesla vehicle built-in browser\n1 Make sure the car is PARKED (0mph/0kph)! \n2 The Tesla vehicle network must be connected to the iOS device Personal Hotspot (cellular data needed) first. Tesla MCU2 hardware is needed. MCU2 is available on the Tesla Model \n3 Model Y, Model X (late than March 2018), Model S (late than March 2018), or the Tesla vehicles that are upgraded to MCU2 from MCU1.3 Start the TslaMirror App. Confirm \"Tesla Proxy\" switch is on in the TslaMirror App\n4 Click the \"Start\" button, then click \"Start Broadcast\" to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n5 Access the link http://240.3.3.3 via Tesla vehicle in-car browser\n6 Pinch the Tesla vehicle built-in browser screen to zoom in/out the picture\n7 There is no audio support for the moment. Only the App screen will be mirrored to the browser. You can use the Bluetooth audio link to the Tesla vehicle play the audio of the iOS device simultaneously during the App mirroring.\n8 Do not lock the screen. The Screen Broadcast API limitation needs the screen to keep unlocked. Once the screen is locked, Screen Broadcast needs to be restarted.\n\nFor normal desktop browser\n1 Devices are on the same Wi-Fi network\n2 Start the TslaMirror App.\n3 Click the \"Start\" button to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n4 Access the link below the \"Stop\" button via a normal desktop browser (Safari or Chrome)\n\nKey Features\n1 No extra internet traffic for the screencast, the App mirroring traffic is only locally on iOS device Personal Hotspot. However, please note that during the screenshot, the Tesla vehicle will use the hotspot traffic for its internet access when the hotspot is connected\n2 No extra hardware needed\n3 Private, the screencast is only available to the devices connected to the iOS Personal Hotspot Wi-Fi network\n4 Fast network\n5 5GHz Personal Hotspot(iPhone 12 series supports it) Wi-Fi is highly recommended. Do not enable the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting for iPhone 12 series. By default, iPhone 12 series come with a 5GHz Wi-Fi Personal Hotspot. Once the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting enabled, it will go back to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nFAQ\n1 This is not CarPlay\n2 iOS Apps that use the AVPlayer framework cannot be supported, such as the Apple Music App and Netflix App. For the Apple Music App, although the screen can be streamed to the browser, the audio part will be muted during the Screen Broadcast.\n3 Netflix App not supported\n\nPrivacy/Security notice: This App does not collect any statistics, personal information, or analytics from our users.This Application does use Location service to access Wi-Fi access point network name on iOS 13 or later.

Supported Create ML models are: Activity Classifier, Tabular Regressor and Tabular Classifier.\n- If you have an Apple Watch, HealthKit data such as heart rate, energy used, sleep and movement data can be exported on the watch as a csv or json file and then transferred to your iPhone.\n\nSensor data iPhone / iPad:\nFor sample log files, please visit the SensorLog homepage (link App Support).\n- CLLocation, CLHeading, CMAccelerometer, CMGyroData, CMMagnetometer, CMDeviceMotion, CMActivity, CMPedometer, CMAltimeter, WLAN and network provider IP addresses, device orientation, battery info, decibels.\n\n\nThe most important functions for Apple Watch:\n\n- Logging Option 1: Logging duration up to 1 hour\nSimultaneous logging of all selectable sensor data is supported in the background with up to 50Hz. Individual sensors can be logged with a higher frequency of up to 100Hz. Streaming (only client mode, TCP) and HTTP requests are supported.\n- Logging option 2: Logging duration greater than 1 hour\nIn the background only logging of the accelerometer data with max. 50Hz is supported. In the foreground all sensor data with up to 100Hz. Streaming and HTTP requests are only supported when the app is in the foreground.\n- Depending on the network speed, the server configuration used and the selected logging option, streaming is possible at up to 100Hz. A connected iPhone with LAN/WAN connection is required.\n- Via HTTP(S) GET/POST request, sensor data can be transmitted to a REST API with up to 10Hz in JSON format (POST) or form-url encoded (POST and GET).\n- With the SensorLog Remote Client function, the sensor data can be sent to an iPhone or iPad with an activated SensorLog Remote Server function and visualized there. The connected SensorLog Remote Server can start and stop logging on the watch as request sending the sensor data.\n- The Health Store data feature off the SensorLog Watch app allows you to export HealthKit data like heart rate, energy burned, sleep, and movement data. This data is automatically recorded by your Watch and can be read out and exported by SensorLog as csv or json file and transferred to your iPhone.\n- Logging can be started and stopped using Siri and Shortcuts.\n\nSensor Data Watch:\nFor sample log files, please visit the SensorLog homepage (link App Support).\n- CLLocation, CMAccelerometer, CMDeviceMotion, CMActivity, CMPedometer, CMAltimeter, battery info"

Developed specifically with energy consumption in mind, Battery Grapher has almost no impact on battery life. \n\nSMART PREDICTIONS\nBattery Grapher uses historical battery levels to intelligently predict what your battery level will be throughout the rest of the day, allowing you to plan when to next charge your device. The longer you have Battery Grapher installed, the more accurate future battery level predictions will be.\n\nLOW ENERGY CONSUMPTION\nBattery Grapher is made for people who want to extend the battery life, meaning that low energy usage is a priority. The app runs a background task only once an hour, and doesn't require a network connection, which keeps energy consumption extremely low.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE NOTIFICATIONS \nBattery Grapher allows you to set notifications that fit your needs. You can  get the app to notify you when you battery drops below a preset percentage, or if you only have a certain number of hours left before your battery runs out. (currently only available on watchOS)\n\nALL COMPLICATIONS & WIDGET SIZES SUPPORTED\nBattery Grapher supports all complications & widget sizes. Complications can show hours before needing to charge, or battery %. Both complications and widgets are customizable from within the app."

      "label": "Statistics Calculator++ is a  scientific calculator with statistical, regression analysis, probability distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests capabilities. \n \nIn designing the statistics functions of this app we had one thing in mind: The user should not need to read a single line of manual to perform the statistical analysis. \n\nSimply use Add X, Add Y, and Add f buttons to enter the elements of the lists and frequencies, if any, and you are done. All the statistics and regression models are only a few taps and swipes away. Tap the List button to see the lists entered. The elements of the lists are interpreted independently (as two separate lists) and jointly for regression analysis (if the size of the lists are equal). You can also take advantage of a new import feature to bring in your data from Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers by first converting them into .csv format.\n\nThe sum, mean, population standard deviation, sample standard deviation, sample variance, sum of squares, min, max, quartiles, and sum of multiplications of two lists are presented in a table. You can see the box and whiskers plot and histogram of the data.\n\nFor regression analysis linear, logarithmic, exponential, power, and quadratic regressions are calculated. Statistics Calculator++ has an extremely simple and intuitive user interface to choose the regression model and calculate predictions for x and y values and view residuals and residual sum of squares. It also graphs the regression model and how it fits around the data entered.\n\nYou have the capability to save multiple lists of data and use any of them as list X, list Y, or list f. Access Lists Editor feature by tapping the icon on top right of the Statistics Lists view. Furthermore, all these lists persist in the memory. Therefore, if you close and the relaunch the app the lists are there for you.\n\nNormal distribution functionality of TI-83/TI-84 (normalpdf, normalcdf, invNorm, ShadeNorm),  Student's t-distribution (tpdf, tcdf, invT), Chi-Squared distribution, F distribution, Binomial distribution (binompdf, binomcdf), Poisson distribution (poissonpdf, poissoncdf), and Geometric distribution (geometpdf, geometcdf) are all possible with this app with an easy to use, and beautiful user interface. In addition you have Beta and Gamma Distributions.\n\nConfidence interval calculation and step by step explanation for \"One Population Proportion\", \"Difference in Two Population Proportions\", \"Population Mean\", and \"Difference in Population Means\".\n\nHypothesis test for \"Population Proportion\", \"Difference in Two Population Proportions\", \"Population Mean\" and \"Population Mean Difference\" with known and unknown population standard deviations.\n\nOther major features of Statistics Calculator++ are:\n- The left pane scrolls to reveal more functionality without a need to switch modes.\n- You see the expression as you enter and it keeps a history of your calculations \n- Capability of performing fraction manipulations and converting between different formats (proper, improper, and mixed fractions) and seamless integration of fraction, integer, and decimal manipulations.\n- Capability of inputting degrees, minutes, and seconds for angles and converting between degrees-minutes-seconds format and decimal format.\n- Capability of calculating permutation, combination, Least Common Multiple (LCM), Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), and prime factorization.\n- Quadratic and system of two linear equations solver\n- Rectangular to polar and polar to rectangular coordinate conversion (extremely useful for phasor calculations for electrical engineers)\n- Throws a set of dice (choice of 1 die to 4 dice)\n- Backspace to delete last digit entered.\n\nThis is an ongoing project and we are working on more features and functions to be added to every update of the app.\n\nYou are going to love the simplicity of the user interface and yet have the powerful functionality with which Statistics Calculator++ is loaded."

JAPAN, any website, and native apps – Overamped will find and redirect to the canonical version automatically. This means it will work with all AMP and Yandex Turbo pages no matter how the page is opened.\n\nOPEN NATIVE APPS\nIf you have the native app installed for a website that is redirected Overamped will automatically open the native app rather than the website.\n\nSAFARI HISTORY\nWebsites redirected by Overamped won't appear in your history and going back or forward will never load the AMP or Yandex Turbo page.\n\nDISABLE OVERAMPED FOR SPECIFIC WEBSITES\nIf you prefer the AMP or Yandex Turbo version of a website you can disable Overamped for any websites you choose.\n\nSTATISTICS\nOveramped can display statistics, including how many AMP results have been found and how many redirections Overamped has performed. All statistics are collected and remain exclusively on-device.\n\nPRIVACY\nOveramped does not transmit any data off the device. This means that none of your data is shared, sold, or otherwise given to any third parties."

Once connected to the TV, you can mirror your phone screen to TV with one tap and no additional hardware is required.\n\nThis application is perfect for:\n- Making presentations at a sharing session or business meeting.\n- Screen share your local photos, videos, movies and files on a bigger screen.\n- Mirror popular mobile apps from iPhone or iPad to Smart TV.\n- Stream your favorite shows, sports matches, online movies and live channels on big TVs.\n- Play music from your iPhone through your Smart TV Speaker.\n\nHow the app works:\n1. Make sure the iPhone/iPad and Samsung TVs are connected to the same local WiFi network. Don't setup VLAN or subnet on local router.\n2. Launch the Mirror for Smart View app. Make sure all the permissions have been granted at the app opening. For iOS 14 and above, Local Network Access is required to search devices on local network. \n3. With all the permissions granted, the app will start searching for Samsung TV(s) on local network.\nWhen TV(s) found, please select one. While you use this app for the first time, depending on your Samsung TV Model, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In this case, take your TV Remote Control and press \"OK\" to allow connection from your iPhone or iPad to Samsung TV.\n4. Click on \"Start Mirroring\" to start mirroring on the Samsung TV that you have selected. It might be 3-5s before your iPhone/iPad screen will be mirrored to the Samsung TV. You can just go to any other apps you like on iPhone/iPad, and enjoy the screen on the larger TV.\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options.\n1) Click on the red button that you will see on your iPhone or iPad top bar.\n2) Go to the Mirror for Smart View app and click on the \"Stop Mirroring\".\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Support all the major Samsung  Smart TVs 2012 models onward (2012 or later models with DLNA).\n- A smart view enabled receiver can be installed on Samsung TVs 2014 models onward. There will be a better mirroring experience about just 1-3s than DLNA.\n- Both support landscape and portrait orientations for mirroring. It is much better on Samsung TV when you watching movies in full screen mode.\n- Support mirroring screen with audio and you can disable app audio at starting mirroring."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

Arrival and departure times are automatically recorded as soon as you enter or leave an interesting place – it works like magic! Of course all very energy efficient, thanks to the latest Geofencing & iBeacon technologies! With the integrated webhook feature you can even trigger your home automation system as you arrive or leave (e.g. switch on the lights when coming home)!\n\nIdeal for automatic monitoring of working hours, client visits, lunch breaks or the stays on your favorite places! GEOFENCY offers the easiest and most effective way to MONITOR your DURATION OF STAYS on interesting places. Unpleasant manual time recording was yesterday!\n\n• Are you tired of having to write down working hours again and again?\n• Fed up leaving the office absently, missed to check the clock?\n• Can't you remember when you came or left your favorite places?\n\nLet the iPhone take over this nerve-racking time monitoring for you!\n\nWith GEOFENCY this is now possible in a smart and clever new way! Simply mark your points of interest on a map and leave the rest to Geofency!\n\nGEOFENCY automatically tracks the times when you enter or leave your points of interest. Simply carry your iPhone in your pocket or bag with you. You will automatically receive extensive statistics and graphics over time!\n\nAutomatic Location-based Time Tracking – The (GEO)FANCY way!\n\nFEATURES\n• Automatic location-based time tracking - 24/7 time recording for your points of interest!\n• Graphical visualization of your dwell times (by simply rotating your device to landscape) - with zoom!\n• Rich statistics: Single-, Day-, Week- & Month-Summaries.\n• Map-View: Manage your points of interest directly on a beautiful fullscreen map view.\n• Add new locations in seconds – With just one tap!\n• Runs completely in the background while trying to maintain good battery life!\n• Automatic recognition when you enter or leave a place or region.\n• Tags: To group places into tags.\n• Webhook feature: Lets you control your home automation system to e.g. switch on lights as you arrive!\n• Journaling feature: Automatic recognition of frequent visited places – to know exactly when you've been where and how long!\n• Calendar-Export: Export events automatically into your calendar (iCloud, CalDAV & Exchange) – view your data comfortable even from Mac or PC!\n• Today Widget: See the most interesting details right from the Notification Center with one swipe and be more productive!\n• Apple Watch App!\n• Export feature: Send time recordings via e.g. email in an Excel-friendly format!\n• Export time data and use it directly in Excel, Numbers or Harvest!\n\nBENEFITS\nSimple to use daily timesaver!

We will never collect or share any information about you. We respect and care about the privacy of our users!\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nFor the best and most accurate monitoring results, Wi-Fi, carrier and location services should always be enabled for Geofency. iBeacon monitoring requires at least Bluetooth 4.\n\nBATTERY USE\nContinued use of GPS in the background can significantly reduce battery life. Geofency was designed to use GPS very sparingly and never in the background. The app relies mostly on cell tower + Wi-Fi locations. This has been carefully chosen to get the best battery life.\n\nWHAT PEOPLE SAY\n• \"I had no idea that my iPhone could do such things!\"\n• \"Beautiful, polished and elegant designed. Extremely simple to use.\"\n• \"Perhaps the most overall effective app available.\"\n\nFind out more on our landing page: www.geofency.com\nSample-Scripts for easy webhook integration: www.geofency.com/geo.zip"

      "label": "The iPhone speed radar - easy-to-use speed measurement in your pocket, anytime, anywhere!\n\nA unique, advanced app designed to easily measure the speed of cars, boats, skaters, skiers, cyclists, animals, models, footballs, tennis serves, etc. The system is based on motion detection, enabling you to track a moving object using a hand-held device alone. SpeedClock includes three separate speed measurement tools and two distance estimation tools.   \n\nSpeed Radar  \nSpeedClock uses the camera to detect and analyze motion, and a reference distance to calculate the speed of an object. Define the distance to the object of interest, hold the iPhone still and let the object pass across the the screen. The speed is displayed automatically. SpeedClock is also able to automatically measure the speed and save an image of passing objects. The measurement can be initiated from an Apple Watch and the speed displayed on the watch face.\n\n  High Speed Video Recording \nAn additional speed tool records and processes a video, which enables SpeedClock to track small, fast object, such as flying balls, that can be difficult to catch with regular motion detection.   It also calculates additional parameters like acceleration.\n\nSynchronized Timing Gates \nA third speed instrument uses two iPhone/iPads equipped with motion detection to start and stop the timer and measure the speed. The distance between the devices is used as reference, and the speed is calculated based on the time taken by the object to travel between the 'Start' and 'Stop' devices. The time is transmitted wirelessly over WiFi or Bluetooth.\n\n  Distance Measurement \n The stadimeter uses the size of a known object, e.g. a car, to calculate the distance.  The clinometer uses your own height as reference, along with the angle of the iPhone, to estimate the distance to a point on the ground.  The distances obtained from either tool can then be used to calculate the speed.  \n\nSee a demo video at the application website (www.appmaker.se/speedClock)\n\nON LINE REVIEWS\n“All I can say is, Fantastic”\nhttp://www.madxperts.com/2010/12/03/measure-speed-app-speedclock-iphone-download/\n\n\"Wow, how cool is that!\"\nhttp://www.ithinkdiff.com/turn-iphone-speed-measuring-gun-speedclock-download/\n\n\"You really going to like this app\"\ndailyappshow.com/speedclock (video)\n\n\"A useful utility for anyone needing to measure speed\"\nappmodo.com/44581/\n\n\"Useful, easy to use and quite a bit of fun (4 of 5)\"\nappvader.com/2011/03/review-speedclock-iphone/\n\n\"speedClock is a useful app when you need to check the speed of yourself, or an object for exercise, racing or simple curiosity (4.5 of 5)\"\nwww.cooliphoneipadapps.com/2010/12/speedclock.html\n\n\"Astonishing\"\niphonelife.com/blog/5/speedclock-velocity-radar-099-app-lets-you-use-camera-measure-speed-objects\n\n\"It is a pleasure to use and operate.

Easily integrate the Prowl API into your applications.\n\nA list of supported apps/services: http://prowlapp.com/apps.php\n\nThe only limit of what the service can do is your imagination.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nTo receive notifications from your computer, you need the latest:\n• Growl on your Mac @ growl.info, or\n• Growl for Windows @ growlforwindows.com, or\n• Snarl on Windows @ fullphat.net, or\n• Any program or web service using the public API.\n\nTHE CRITICS\n\"I was extremely impressed with Prowl and the elegance with which I was able to view Growl notifications on my iPhone.”\n—Aron Trimble, TUAW\n\n\"[A] powerful tool to connect your Mac with your iPhone, seamlessly over the air.\n—Federico Viticci, MacStories\n\n\"Great idea. This opens up iPhone push notifications for anything you can think of.”\n—John Gruber, Daring Fireball\n\n\"Probably the best $3 I’ve ever spent in the App Store.”\n—Darrell Etherington, The Apple Blog\n\nFEATURES\n• Push Notifications—When a Growl notification pops up on your computer, it's sent to Prowl and displayed on your iOS device within seconds.\n\n• Sweet application support—Prowl has support from a bunch of cool applications and services. Check out the full list at http://prowlapp.com/apps.php\n\n• Redirections—Launch a different application when you open a push notification. For example, a notification from your desktop Twitter client can relaunch into your favorite mobile client. You can even pick custom URLs to launch, so you can go anywhere!\n\n• Email to push—Use your Prowl email address (from the Prowl homepage's \"API keys\" tab) to get email delivery right on your device. Generate as many email addresses as you need!\n\n• An amazing API—Use the Prowl API with a multitude of libraries in various programming languages. You can send notifications from anything that can talk to the internet, and do some fun things along with it.\n\n• Quiet Hours—During the hours you specify, only the badge numbers are updated. No matter the source. Instead of getting a noisy alert, messages are quietly delivered. You can allow emergency-priority items to break quiet hours.\n\n• Do Not Disturb—Keep the application quiet whenever you're busy, or when you need a break from a constant alert. Controllable from within the application.\n\n• Control—Open the edit view to get a quick glance at your notifications, and do away with pesky ones. Quickly copy, email or SMS a notification directly from Prowl (depending on device and iOS version).\n\n• Browse quickly—Use Prowl's internal browser to quickly open links from a notification without having to open Safari.\n\n• History—Up to 10 days of notifications are kept on the server. You can delete notifications that you don't want to see any more, or remove all of your history.\n\n• Customized notifications—Only events you want are sent to Prowl. You can specify all kinds of conditions from the Prowl plugin for Growl.\n\n• Send any message to your device—From the Prowl website, you can send any text to your device: links and phone numbers are automatically linked, so you can easily navigate around without having to worry about typos. From the website or API, you can also automatically redirect to the attached URL.\n\nSETUP\nProwl is built into Growl 2.0. For earlier versions: http://prowlapp.com/installation.php — for Mac.\nhttp://growlforwindows.com — for Windows.\n\nSUPPORT\n@prowlapp on Twitter\nhttp://prowlapp.com/support.php"

      "label": "Sunnytrack transforms your device into a professional tool for planning sunlight, the sun’s position, path and shadows for every place in the world (and at every time) accurately, on the map or in AR. Whether for photography, real estate, your new flat or house, gardening, photovoltaics or all outdoor activities: sunlight, sun position and shadows play a major role. See sun’s elevation, its direction, exact sun movement over day and year, objects’ shadows, shadow lengths, shadow differences between seasons, and more.\n\nRECOMMENDED BY PROFESSIONALS:\n\n„This app is awesome! It has helped me to align the PV modules (solar panels) optimally.“ – Jürgen\n\n„For me as a photographer Sunnytrack is an extremely practical tool. Always knowing the sun’s position in real time brings enormous relief. Planning photo shootings becomes significantly easier.“ – Aki from Akigrafie Live\n\n„I am absolutely thrilled. I work in the real estate industry and can now use AR to check with my clients when the sun is shining on the balcony. Amazed customers guaranteed.“ – Toni K.\n\n„It's very useful and professional. It helps me coordinate my trips.“ – Dino\n\nPHILOSOPHY: No ads. No user tracking. Sunnytrack tracks the sun, but only the sun, not the user! For sure. This app is a professional product. It can be bought for a one-time price to get all the high quality features it offers at once, without distracting ads or the need for further in app purchases.\n\n• CREATORS (in photography/filming) all over the world love Sunnytrack not only for its easy usage but also for the extensive functionality it offers. With it you're guaranteed to not miss a perfect scene and optimal light – during the day, Golden Hour or Blue Hour, for instance. Precise, location-dependent planning of the sun’s position and natural lighting of your subjects are extremely relevant in photography – whether capturing landscapes, objects or humans.\n\n• You would like to know the effective AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT a flat or house/property offers? During Winter, when days are shorter? Get a general picture in advance on Maps or impress at site visits and property tours with showing the sun’s path at the kitchen window for the whole year, live in 3D in your camera image using Augmented Reality (AR)! It’s an insiders’ tip for real estate agents, house builders or interested individuals in general.\n\n• PHOTOVOLTAICS: Sunnytrack provides professional support in placing, adjusting and optimizing your solar modules. Where does sun rise, where does it set? See the differences between the seasons at your location.\n\n• We love green! We love GARDENS. Plan your garden with Sunnytrack. Simulate the exact shadows of multiple objects in Shadow Simulation mode, by adding them on the map defining their heights. For example, you can see the length and impact of shadows casted by objects like houses or a trees when the sun follows its path.\n\n• SAVE all planned scenes, sun paths, shadow simulations and your places for later use.\n\n• As you can see in the screenshots, DAY VIEW provides precise, location-dependent information on the sun like day length, solar noon, sunrise, sunset and twilight times (like Blue Hour, Golden Hour, Astronomical Twilight, …)\n\n• For all OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES Sunnytrack wants to be your faithful companion as a sun tracker and planner. Whether in cities, in the mountains or when touring through valleys, meadows and fields, the app develops its full potential: on Maps, live in AR or even in advance when planning.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nIdeas and feedback are very welcome. Please use the provided feedback function in the app.\n\nAR 3D functionality: Sunnytrack shows the sun’s position and path based on the orientation of your device with high precision. For identifying its orientation, your devices’ internal sensors are used. In order to achieve exact results, a calibration can be required by moving your device in a figure-eight-pattern and keeping it away of metallic objects."

The front-facing camera will use the infrared sensor in the TrueDepth camera. The rear-facing camera will use the new LiDAR sensor. The LiDAR & Infrared Night Vision app turns the world around you into a depth map, where different colors represent distances from your device.\n\nSCARE YOUR FRIENDS \nTrigger scare-mode and set your friends up for a huge scream.\n\nFor best results, be in complete darkness in a room with space behind you. Explain to your friends how the cool new app shows things around the room you can’t see with the naked eye. Make sure your friend’s face is on the screen, and after 30 seconds, a jump-scare flashes on screen, and captures the terrified face.  \n\nAPPLICATIONS\nSee in the dark without turning on your flashlight\nShow off your new phone capabilities\nScare Your Friends\nMake Your Friends Cry\nShare your friend’s terror with a captured picture or video.\nExplore how LiDAR and infrared technology works\nLearn about depth maps and seeing without light\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nUnlike a regular camera, LiDAR and infrared sensors do not need ambient light.  They both generate their own light, which you cannot see. Therefore, both sensors will work in complete darkness.\n\nOTHER DEVICES\nThis app will work on devices that don’t have LiDAR. It will use the front TrueDepth camera to provide a depth map of yourself and objects behind you. The rear-facing display will not work without an iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, or iPad Pro (4th Generation).\n\nWorks on any iOS device with FaceID/TrueDepth including: iPhone X, iPhone XS, iphone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPad Pro (3rd generation), iPad Pro (4th generation), iPad Pro 2021"

This app distinguishes itself with its reliability, ease of use, speed, and with a true \"2-way sync\" that merges changes made to either account.  This is the #1 app for syncing contacts both in terms of downloads & reviews.\n\nAlso of significance, this app syncs your Google labels or Outlook categories with iPhone. For instance, you may have organized your Google contacts into groups such as \"friends,\" \"family,\" and \"coworkers.\"  After syncing, your iPhone and Google groups will match.  Once your groups are synced, you can easily send group emails from your iPhone.\n\nNew for 2022, the app is now capable of syncing your Outlook contacts with one of your iPhone accounts, such as iCloud.  Your Outlook contacts can belong to a personal account, such as Outlook.com, or a business account, such as Office 365.\n\nNew for 2021, the app is now capable of syncing 2 Google accounts with each other, so you can share the same contacts between a personal Google account and a work Google account, for example!\n\nCONTACT ACCOUNTS:\n• Choose to sync Google with iPhone, Outlook with iPhone, or 2 Google accounts\n• Choose to sync a specific iPhone account, such as a local iPhone address book, iCloud, Exchange, or a CardDAV account\n\nSYNC TYPES:\n• Choose from one of the following sync types: 2-way sync, 1-way Sync, and Manual Sync\n• Choose a 2-way sync to sync changes in both directions\n• Choose a 1-way sync to transfer changes in one direction only\n• Choose a manual sync to sync specific contacts only\n\nSYNCS ALL FIELDS:\n• Syncs all fields including names, phonetic names, nicknames, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses, company names, job titles, departments, birthdays, anniversaries, events, notes, web page addresses, relationships, instant messaging accounts, & social profiles\n• Syncs contact photos\n• Syncs custom labels & custom fields\n\nINITIAL SYNC:\n• During the initial sync, the contents of matching contacts will be merged\n\nCONFIRM CHANGES BEFORE SYNCING:\n• Review each change before the sync actually begins\n\nAUTOMATIC SYNC:\n• Automatically syncs contacts in the background 24/7\n\nAPPLY FILTERS INCLUDING GROUP FILTER:\n• Apply the group filter, new contact filter, and more!\n\nDUPLICATES:\n• Eliminate Google duplicates directly from the app, and then sync to remove the same duplicates from iPhone"

Its unit is meter per second. \n- [λ] Wavelength is the distance over which the shape of wave repeats. It depends on the medium a wave travels through. \n- [f] Frequency of a wave refers to how many times (per a given time period) do the particles of a medium vibrate when the wave is passing through it. The unit of frequency is Hertz, or 1/second.\n\nWavelength Formula:\n f = v/λ\n\nWhere:\nλ (Lambda) = Wavelength in meters\nv = Wave velocity \nf = Frequency (Hz)\n\nThanks for your support and do visit nitrio.com for more apps for your iOS devices."

      "label": "With SatFinder you can adjust your satellite antenna in a few seconds and with 4 simple steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - CHOOSE YOUR ANTENNA\nChoose one of the four different antenna designs: \n - Offset antennas (the most common, is slightly oval, the LNB is not in the center).\n - Special design (e.g. Oblong shaped Offset antenna, Multifeed antenna)  \n - Parabolic antenna (LNB is located in the center of the reflector, usually larger than 100cm)\n - Flat or planar antenna (small, camping antennas)\n\nIf you have an offset antenna, enter the height and width of the antenna. If your antenna has a special shape, enter the offset angle and the size of the satellite antenna. You can find the offset angle in the manual of your satellite antenna. For parabolic antennas it is sufficient to enter the antenna diameter. With a flat antenna you do not have to set anything. If you know the exact antenna name, check if your antenna is already in the database.\n\nTip: Press the wizard button to measure the size of the satellite antenna using the iPhone camera and LiDAR scanner. \n\nSTEP 2 - CHOOSE YOUR SATELLITE\nTo quickly and easily select a suitable satellite, simply press the \"AUTO\" button. The SatFinder will now automatically search for satellites that are in your reception area and that offer TV or radio stations in your language (the language setting of your iPhone will be selected). The stars (1-10) shown in the table result from the number of radio and TV channels offered and the reception strength at your location.  \n\nIf you want to receive a special satellite, switch off \"AUTO\": Now you can simply scroll through the table and select the satellite. Faster is the search function - just enter the name of the satellite, the channel or the orbit position. You can also reduce the number of table entries by hiding satellites that are not available at your location or do not broadcast in your language. With the button \"Channel Info\" you can check which channels the selected satellite is currently broadcasting - including all channel parameters for your satellite receiver.  \n\nSTEP 3 - CHECK OBSTACLES\nFor a smooth satellite reception, there must not be any obstacles between the satellite and your satellite antenna. You can check this with the \"View\" function. Simply aim at the satellite and watch the signs (GREEN - no obstacle, RED - caution, free view may not be given).\n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 4 - ADJUST ANTENNA\nIn the menu item \"Align\" different graphics appear depending on the selected antenna type. If you use an offset antenna, you have to adjust the azimuth and elevation separately. With planar or parabolic antennas the adjustment of the angles is done together. Before you press the \"Start\" button, a video clip shows how to position your iPhone at the antenna. \n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 5 - FINE TUNING \nIf necessary, you can optimize the reception of your satellite system. The SatFinder provides you with the function \"FineTuning\". To use this function, you need a second iOS device. One device serves as a camera; the second device as a monitor. Simply place an iPhone in front of your reception screen and observe changes in picture quality while slightly rotating or tilting your satellite antenna. With the FineTuning feature, you'll have visual contact with your TV even when you're out of sight. \n\nTHAT'S IT. YOU SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ENJOY INTERFERENCE-FREE SATELLITE RECEPTION... \nNote: Satellite antenna tuning is only available on iOS devices with LiDAR sensor (e.g. iPhone 12 Pro)."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Velkommen til ny Gjensidige Øvelseskjørings-app!\n\nVi har jobbet mye med å gjøre den mer brukervennlig og stabil enn den forrige øvelseskjørings-appen.\n\nI denne nye versjonen har vi valgt å forenkle appen og gjort den enda enklere og raskere å bruke enn den forrige. Vi kommer til å jobbe kontinuerlig med å forbedre appen og alle tilbakemeldinger du gir oss blir satt pris på og delt med teamet som jobber med å lage appen.\n\nKjør forsiktig! \n\nTrygge bilsjåfører får flere fordeler\n\nUnge som har øvelseskjørt mye før de tar lappen på bil blir tryggere i trafikken og mindre utsatt for ulykker. Ved å logge minimum 2000 km med appen «Øvelseskjøring», vil vi i Gjensidige gi forsikringsfordeler når lappen er i boks. Både til den ferske sjåføren og til de som låner bort bilen sin til ham eller henne.\n\nSlik bruker du appen:\n\nTrykk på «Kjør» når du begynner turen. Appen logger antall kilometer og tid. Tar du pause underveis, trykker du på pauseknappen. Når dere er ferdige med turen, skal ledsager signere etter å ha trykket på pauseknappen, og deretter velger dere “Lagre kjøretur”. Alle turer må være signert av ledsager for at de skal telle med i sammendraget. Når du har øvelseskjørt 2000 km i appen sender du sluttrapporten inn til Gjensidige via appen. Dermed får du automatisk fordelene du har krav på.\n\nForsikringsfordelene ved gjennomført 2000 kilometer\n\n• Du som ved hjelp av denne appen dokumenterer at du har øvelseskjørt minimum 2000 kilometer før du tar lappen, får hele 70 % startbonus på bilforsikringen hos Gjensidige. Dette så fremt dette er din første bilforsikring.\n\n• Andre med bilforsikring hos Gjensidige kan låne bort bilen sin til deg som er ung sjåfør og beholde rabatten for «alle bilførere er over 23 år», selv om du er under 23 år.\n\nRegler for øvelseskjøring\n\n• Eleven må ha fylt 16 år og ha gjennomført trafikalt grunnkurs.\n\n• Ledsager må ha fylt 25 år og hatt førerkort klasse B sammenhengende i de siste 5 årene.\n\n• Bilen skal være utstyrt med forskriftsmessig «L» skilt (rød L på hvit bakgrunn), og ekstra innvendig speil. Dette kan kjøpes på [www.sikkerhetsbutikken.no](http://www.sikkerhetsbutikken.no/).\nHusk at om du har GPS på i bakgrunnen, så kan batteritiden reduseres fortere.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Dette gjør at du får en optimal forberedelse og oppnår den kunnskapen som Statens vegvesen krever for å bestå teoriprøven.\n\nTEORIKURS\nI appen kan du gjennomføre teorikurs. Teorikurset er oppdelt i tema som samsvarer med temalisten til Statens vegvesen. Temalisten definerer hvilken kunnskap man må ha ved den offisielle teoriprøven. Teorikurset inneholder grundige forklaringer og illustrasjoner. Du kan enkelt navigere deg rundt i teorikurset og følge egen utvikling. \n\nTEORIPRØVER\nI appen kan du gjennomføre lynquiz eller øve deg på en fullverdig teoritentamen. Alle oppgavene i appen er laget på samme måte som ved selve teoriprøven og er knyttet til de ulike tema fra temalisten til Statens vegvesen. Alle spørsmål har utdypende forklaring, slik at kunnskapsnivået ditt øker for hver gjennomføring. Appen består av flere hundre spørsmål som dekker alle moduler fra temalisten. Innholdet er kvalitetssikret og oppdateres hver uke. I appen kan man følge egen utvikling innen de ulike tema. Man får oversikt over hvilke tema man behersker godt og hvilke tema man bør studere nærmere, gjennom teorikurs eller oppgaver. \n\nSKILTQUIZ\nDu lærer hva de ulike trafikkskiltene betyr ved å studere skiltoversikt og ved å gjennomføre skiltquiz.\n\nFØLG DIN UTVIKLING\nI resultatoversikten får du presentert nivået ditt innen de ulike tema. Du får også detaljert historikk over gjennomførte teoriprøver, med forklaring til de spørsmålene hvor du svarte feil. \n\nI resultatoversikten kan du også sammenligne deg med andre brukere av appen. Kan du oppnå førsteplass og få gullpokalen?\n\nI appen følger du din progresjon og kan se når du er godt nok forberedt til å bestå den offisielle teoriprøven.\n\nANBEFALING\nVi får stadig tilbakemeldinger fra tidligere brukere og trafikklærere, som anbefaler appen videre til venner, familie og kunder. \n\nLast ned appen og test innholdet i appen gratis. \n\nLykke til!\n\n\nRetningslinjer for personvern: https://www.teoriquizen.no/personvern\nVilkår for bruk: https://www.teoriquizen.no/term-of-use"

The app provides online access to a choice of code editors for programming your micro:bit and, when your program is ready, the app beams it to the micro:bit via Bluetooth wireless.  Easy-to-follow screens lead you through the process of pairing your iPad (or iPhone) to the micro:bit and then transferring your program code.  \nCompared with previous versions,  the micro:bit app Version 3 contains these additional features:\n•\tPair with any number of micro:bits\n•\tChoose which micro:bit is currently connected\n•\tStore HEX files in the app\n•\tChoose a HEX file for flashing\n•\tExport and delete HEX files\n•\tImport stored HEX files directly into JavaScript Blocks editor\n•\tRapid download from JavaScript Blocks editor\n•\tMonitor data detected by micro:bit sensors\n•\tUse the range of micro:bit Bluetooth services in real time\n•\tDisplay messages on the micro:bit LEDs\n•\tSend control commands to the micro:bit buttons and pins\n•\tDe-bug your program code while it is running in the micro:bit\n•\tUse a simulated gamepad to send commands to the micro:bit\n•\tView camera images ready for taking photos or video\n\nAs well as providing more flexible handling of your program scripts and HEX files, a major addition in Version 3 is the Monitor and Control page.  This lets you observe real-time data from the micro:bit sensors, send messages directly to the LEDs and control the micro:bit buttons and pins from your iPad or iPhone.  Monitor is ideal for exploiting Bluetooth services in real time, and for de-bugging your program code while it is running in the micro:bit.\n\nThe MakeCode code editor now requires iOS 13 or later."

      "label": "Velkommen til ny Gjensidige Øvelseskjørings-app!\n\nVi har jobbet mye med å gjøre den mer brukervennlig og stabil enn den forrige øvelseskjørings-appen.\n\nI denne nye versjonen har vi valgt å forenkle appen og gjort den enda enklere og raskere å bruke enn den forrige. Vi kommer til å jobbe kontinuerlig med å forbedre appen og alle tilbakemeldinger du gir oss blir satt pris på og delt med teamet som jobber med å lage appen.\n\nKjør forsiktig! \n\nTrygge bilsjåfører får flere fordeler\n\nUnge som har øvelseskjørt mye før de tar lappen på bil blir tryggere i trafikken og mindre utsatt for ulykker. Ved å logge minimum 2000 km med appen «Øvelseskjøring», vil vi i Gjensidige gi forsikringsfordeler når lappen er i boks. Både til den ferske sjåføren og til de som låner bort bilen sin til ham eller henne.\n\nSlik bruker du appen:\n\nTrykk på «Kjør» når du begynner turen. Appen logger antall kilometer og tid. Tar du pause underveis, trykker du på pauseknappen. Når dere er ferdige med turen, skal ledsager signere etter å ha trykket på pauseknappen, og deretter velger dere “Lagre kjøretur”. Alle turer må være signert av ledsager for at de skal telle med i sammendraget. Når du har øvelseskjørt 2000 km i appen sender du sluttrapporten inn til Gjensidige via appen. Dermed får du automatisk fordelene du har krav på.\n\nForsikringsfordelene ved gjennomført 2000 kilometer\n\n• Du som ved hjelp av denne appen dokumenterer at du har øvelseskjørt minimum 2000 kilometer før du tar lappen, får hele 70 % startbonus på bilforsikringen hos Gjensidige. Dette så fremt dette er din første bilforsikring.\n\n• Andre med bilforsikring hos Gjensidige kan låne bort bilen sin til deg som er ung sjåfør og beholde rabatten for «alle bilførere er over 23 år», selv om du er under 23 år.\n\nRegler for øvelseskjøring\n\n• Eleven må ha fylt 16 år og ha gjennomført trafikalt grunnkurs.\n\n• Ledsager må ha fylt 25 år og hatt førerkort klasse B sammenhengende i de siste 5 årene.\n\n• Bilen skal være utstyrt med forskriftsmessig «L» skilt (rød L på hvit bakgrunn), og ekstra innvendig speil. Dette kan kjøpes på [www.sikkerhetsbutikken.no](http://www.sikkerhetsbutikken.no/).\nHusk at om du har GPS på i bakgrunnen, så kan batteritiden reduseres fortere.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Provide rich feedback using digital ink, text and voice annotations right on images and PDFs, and then add your students’ best work to personalized digital portfolios that can be securely shared with parents.\n\nWHAT EDUCATORS ARE SAYING\n“Showbie is my number one can't live without app! It makes the iPad workflow process a breeze! I especially love how it works seamlessly with so many other apps.”\n— Kristen Paino, Lead Technology Integrator at Avenues: The World School\n\n“I don't need to convince my colleagues that they need to use this app — it sells itself.

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

This app, Play ABC, Alfie Atkins, stimulates children's language learning skills by clearly connecting the function and purpose of letters in an experimental, playful way.\n\nAlfie has some extraordinary devices in his room: a letter tracer, a word machine and a puppet theatre. With the letter tracer, children will learn the appearance and sound of all letters and train their motor skills and muscle memory by drawing and tracing letters on the screen. Using Alfie's homemade word machine, children will spell new words using phonemes and letter tips. All new words are sent to the puppet theatre, where children use their creativity and imagination to tell fantastic stories. This playloop, with concrete results, has a motivational effect and helps children develop their language skills at their own pace.\n\nPlay ABC, Alfie Atkins is developed by language teachers and game designers. It was created and tested in collaboration with teachers and students of schools in Finland and Sweden. The app has been developed based on children's needs and does not feature points, time limits or other elements that could lead to failure or stress. Children will play and learn using the app on their own terms and at their own pace, in preschool, at school or at home.\n\nPlay and learn:\n  • The sounds, phonemes and names of letters\n  • How to trace letters\n  • How to spell around 100 different words\n  • How to read simple words\n  • Upper and lowercase letters\n  • Fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination\n  • The basics of literacy\n  • Creative storytelling\n\nThe app is available in 6 different languages, and the full version allows the creation of individual profiles for multiple children.\n\nPlease note that family sharing of in-app purchases aren't supported by Apple. So if you want to purchase the full version of the app and share it with family members please purchase the separate premium, full version, of the app available on the Appstore instead.\n\nGro Play is an xEdu.co alumnus and member of the trade organization Swedish EdTech Industry. Gro Play collaborates with Playful Learning Center, the University of Helsinki, in the development of game-based learning.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

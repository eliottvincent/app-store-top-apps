      "label": "Velkommen til ny Gjensidige Øvelseskjørings-app!\n\nVi har jobbet mye med å gjøre den mer brukervennlig og stabil enn den forrige øvelseskjørings-appen.\n\nI denne nye versjonen har vi valgt å forenkle appen og gjort den enda enklere og raskere å bruke enn den forrige. Vi kommer til å jobbe kontinuerlig med å forbedre appen og alle tilbakemeldinger du gir oss blir satt pris på og delt med teamet som jobber med å lage appen.\n\nKjør forsiktig! \n\nTrygge bilsjåfører får flere fordeler\n\nUnge som har øvelseskjørt mye før de tar lappen på bil blir tryggere i trafikken og mindre utsatt for ulykker. Ved å logge minimum 2000 km med appen «Øvelseskjøring», vil vi i Gjensidige gi forsikringsfordeler når lappen er i boks. Både til den ferske sjåføren og til de som låner bort bilen sin til ham eller henne.\n\nSlik bruker du appen:\n\nTrykk på «Kjør» når du begynner turen. Appen logger antall kilometer og tid. Tar du pause underveis, trykker du på pauseknappen. Når dere er ferdige med turen, skal ledsager signere etter å ha trykket på pauseknappen, og deretter velger dere “Lagre kjøretur”. Alle turer må være signert av ledsager for at de skal telle med i sammendraget. Når du har øvelseskjørt 2000 km i appen sender du sluttrapporten inn til Gjensidige via appen. Dermed får du automatisk fordelene du har krav på.\n\nForsikringsfordelene ved gjennomført 2000 kilometer\n\n• Du som ved hjelp av denne appen dokumenterer at du har øvelseskjørt minimum 2000 kilometer før du tar lappen, får hele 70 % startbonus på bilforsikringen hos Gjensidige. Dette så fremt dette er din første bilforsikring.\n\n• Andre med bilforsikring hos Gjensidige kan låne bort bilen sin til deg som er ung sjåfør og beholde rabatten for «alle bilførere er over 23 år», selv om du er under 23 år.\n\nRegler for øvelseskjøring\n\n• Eleven må ha fylt 16 år og ha gjennomført trafikalt grunnkurs.\n\n• Ledsager må ha fylt 25 år og hatt førerkort klasse B sammenhengende i de siste 5 årene.\n\n• Bilen skal være utstyrt med forskriftsmessig «L» skilt (rød L på hvit bakgrunn), og ekstra innvendig speil. Dette kan kjøpes på [www.sikkerhetsbutikken.no](http://www.sikkerhetsbutikken.no/).\nHusk at om du har GPS på i bakgrunnen, så kan batteritiden reduseres fortere.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Play with letters, sounds and words together with Alfie Atkins. Children love learning new things through play. This app, Play ABC, Alfie Atkins, stimulates children's language learning skills by clearly connecting the function and purpose of letters in an experimental, playful way.\n\nAlfie has some extraordinary devices in his room: a letter tracer, a word machine and a puppet theatre. With the letter tracer, children will learn the appearance and sound of all letters and train their motor skills and muscle memory by drawing and tracing letters on the screen. Using Alfie's homemade word machine, children will spell new words using phonemes and letter tips. All new words are sent to the puppet theatre, where children use their creativity and imagination to tell fantastic stories. This playloop, with concrete results, has a motivational effect and helps children develop their language skills at their own pace.\n\nPlay ABC, Alfie Atkins is developed by language teachers and game designers. It was created and tested in collaboration with teachers and students of schools in Finland and Sweden. The app has been developed based on children's needs and does not feature points, time limits or other elements that could lead to failure or stress. Children will play and learn using the app on their own terms and at their own pace, in preschool, at school or at home.\n\nPlay and learn:\n  • The sounds, phonemes and names of letters\n  • How to trace letters\n  • How to spell around 100 different words\n  • How to read simple words\n  • Upper and lowercase letters\n  • Fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination\n  • The basics of literacy\n  • Creative storytelling\n\nThe app is available in 6 different languages, and the full version allows the creation of individual profiles for multiple children.\n\nPlease note that family sharing of in-app purchases aren't supported by Apple. So if you want to purchase the full version of the app and share it with family members please purchase the separate premium, full version, of the app available on the Appstore instead.\n\nGro Play is an xEdu.co alumnus and member of the trade organization Swedish EdTech Industry. Gro Play collaborates with Playful Learning Center, the University of Helsinki, in the development of game-based learning.

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "Playing games can be meaningful! At SKIDOS, we know that learning comes naturally to kids through play. That is why we gathered a collection of 40+ unique apps to ensure joyful playtime and engaging learning for 2-11-year-old kids. With SKIDOS apps, kids improve math skills and logical thinking, learn to trace letters and numbers, prompt their curiosity through videos and strengthen 21st-century skills!\n\n40+ APPS WITH SKIDOS PASS\nWith a single Pass, you access all SKIDOS apps where children of different ages will find games to every taste. You can create up to 6 player profiles within one account and log in from multiple devices. Go ahead and customize the app experience for your kids according to their interests and learning level. Stay on top of how your kids learn - check the progress report in the app or via email.\n\nKIDS BATH \nBath is a role-playing game, a toy, and a little helper. It's a fun way to experience bathroom routines and take care of cute, little friends. We took boring things and made them fun to encourage learning through play.\n\nThe app has 7 different scenes:\n- at the sink,\n- in the bath,\n- going to a toilet,\n- taking care of clothes,\n- dressing up,\n- laundry room,\n- playtime\n\nAs parents we get into frustrating situations when kids won't let to brush their hair, clean their nose or cut the nails. BATH is here to help. Play together, talk about activities and learn that there's nothing scary in keeping yourself tidy! :)\n\nSKIDOS LEARNING CURRICULUM\nOur unique approach is to engage kids in learning while they play games they love. We gathered a collection of 40+ fun games and incorporated interactive learning content into them. 4 million kids around the globe play & learn with SKIDOS!\n\nMATH: Our math exercises cover a comprehensive list of topics including number sense, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, geometry, etc. Tasks evolve as a child progresses.

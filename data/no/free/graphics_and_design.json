      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

      "label": "MindsAI is a machine learning platform that turns text into digital artworks. MindsAI comes with a number of built-in art styles and can create remarkably compelling artwork for any prompt you can imagine.\n\n\nCREATE INCREDIBLE IMAGES\n\nNeed some ideas to get started? Give these a go and see what you get:\n\n• A verse from your favourite book\n• Unusual combinations, or impossible situations such as \"Jesus taking a selfie in Central Park\".\n• A line from a movie\n• Movie characters\n• Phobias\n• Dreams & fantasies\n• That song lyric you can't get out of your head\n• Landmarks & famous places\n\n\nEVERY RESULT IS UNIQUE\n\nTry the same prompt with your friends and compare the results, or just try the same prompt multiple times.\nEvery result is one-of-a-kind and unlikely to ever be created again.\n\n\nEXPLORE NEW STYLES\n\nBring your prompt to life with one of our vibrant styles. \nFrom sculptures to rainy neon-lit streets, our styles can transform seemingly simple prompts into distinct and complex scenes.\n\n\nHOW DO I GET STARTED?\n\n1. Enter a prompt in the text box.\n\n2. Pick an art style.\n\n3. Hit the \"Create\" button.\n\n4. That's it! Your artwork will be generated in seconds.\n\n\nAnd best of all, it can all be done for FREE.\n\n---\n\nPrivacy Policy: mindsai.io/policies/privacy\nTerms of Use: mindsai.io/policies/terms"

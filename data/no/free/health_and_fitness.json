      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Gjør du øvelsene vi viser deg på SKADEFRI regelmessig, kan du halvere skaderisikoen!\n\nInnhold (ansvarlig)\nDr scient Kathrin Steffen og Prof dr med Roald Bahr, Senter for idrettsskadeforskning\n\nTakk til økonomisk støtte fra Sparebankstiftelsen DNB, Skadetelefonen, Kulturdepartementet, Norges idrettsforbund og olympiske og paralympiske komité, til våre teknologipartnere Makingwaves og på Norges idrettshøgskole, til den faglig ekspertisen fra Senter for idrettsskadeforskning (NIH), Olympiatoppen (OLT) og norsk idrett, og til våre utøvere og rollemodeller.\n\nVersjon 1.1\nCopyright © 2016 Den internasjonale olympiske komité & Senter for idrettsskadeforskning\nFIFA 11+ videos: Copyright © 2014 FIFA\n \nBeskrivelse\nSkader skjer i de fleste idretter, og dessverre altfor ofte. En idrettsskade kan være ødeleggende for en idrettsutøver, og i verste fall bety slutten på en lovende karriere. Men, idrettsskader kan forebygges. En rekke vitenskapelige studier har vist at man ved hjelp av strukturerte oppvarmingsprogram kan redusere risikoen for skader med over 50%!\n\nAppen SKADEFRI ble utviklet i forbindelse med lanseringen av websiden www.skadefri.no. SKADEFRI appen har sitt utspring i appen Get Set – Train Smarter gjennom et samarbeid mellom Den internasjonale olympiske komité (IOC), Senter for idrettsskadeforskning, vår teknologipartner Making Waves AS, og flere internasjonale idrettsforbund.\nMålgruppen er ikke bare den unge talentfulle utøveren og deres trenere, men alle som er engasjert i fysisk aktivitet. SKADEFRI ble utviklet for å bidra til forebygging av idrettsskader ved å gi deg de mest effektive og forskningsbaserte treningsrutinene.\n\nAlle øvelser presenteres gjennom videoer, understøttet av korte beskrivelser av hvordan du utfører øvelsen riktig. Øvelser presenteres med variasjoner, samt med tre gradvis mer krevende nivåer for å gjøre dem mer utfordrende. Øvelsene er laget for å kunne gjøres med et minimum av utstyr og for å gjøre dem trygge og enkle å gjennomføre uansett hvor du er.\n\nUnder inngangen \"Idrett\", kan du velge din idrett blant 30 sommer- og 15 vinteridretter, men du finner også skadeforebyggende øvelser rettet mot 6 utvalgte kroppsdeler. Med andre ord, for hver av de 45 idrettene kan du velge treningsprogram tilpasset risikoprofilen i din idrett. Øvelsene er utviklet for å hindre skulder-, rygg-, lyske-, hamstrings-, kne- og ankelskader.\nAlle treningsprogrammer kan lastes ned som PDF-filer, der du ser små bilder og korte beskrivelser for hver av øvelsene. PDFen kan deles elektronisk med dine lagkamerater, trenere, venner og familie.\n\nSKADEFRI er gratis og tilgjengelig på norsk. SKADEFRI kan lastes ned for både iOS. Første gangen du velger en øvelse, vil du måtte laste ned videoen til din enhet. Til dette anbefaler vi at du bruker en trådløs tilkobling, for å være sikker på å unngå eksterne kostnader. Når du først har lastet ned videoene, er disse lagret på enheten, slik at du kan dra nytte av dem uansett hvor du befinner deg."

It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\r\n\r\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

Du kan se og endre dine timebestillinger, samt se helsedata du selv har registrert, på helseboka.app eller i denne appen (krever ikke abonnement). Det er kun du som bruker, og de du velger å dele helsedata med gjennom Helseboka, som vil ha tilgang til dine helsedata. \r\n\r\nPå sikt ønsker vi at du skal eie dine egne helsedata. For å komme dit må mange helseaktører kunne snakke med deg gjennom Helseboka. Vi er på vei dit, men har enda et stykke å gå. Vi håper å kunne gi deg mange nye verktøy og muligheter i tiden som kommer."

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

Conceived in conjunction with Yale University's Center for Emotional Intelligence and based on the work of Dr Marc Brackett, How We Feel helps people find the right word to describe how they feel while tracking their sleep, exercise, and health trends using HealthKit in order to spot patterns over time.\n\nFounded as a science-based nonprofit, How We Feel is made possible by donations from people who are passionate about bringing mental wellbeing to the widest possible audience. Our data privacy terms are clear and easy-to-understand: all of your data is kept on your device unless you opt-in to send an anonymized version of your check-ins to be used in research to help more people.\n\nWhether you are downloading this app in order to build better relationships, make your emotions to work for you, not against you, improve how you handle stress and anxiety or simply to feel better, How We Feel will help you identify patterns through daily HealthKit tracking and find emotional regulation strategies that will work for you. The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

I tillegg til norske matvarer inneholder også appen oppskrifter som er lavFODMAP. \n\nVi håper at du, med IBS, med denne appen får en enklere hverdag. Vi håper også at du får matglede og at du finner mange nye matvarer du ikke visste var magevennlige. Vi håper også at du deler denne appen med andre på dietten.

Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations not only do they help make major shifts in your mindset they also serve as prompts and daily reminders on what you are truly capable of, making sure you have an amazing day, everyday.\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your unconscious mind and your conscious mind.\nThe more you strengthen this connection the more resilient you will be when difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe.\n\nAnd the best way strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\nThere are so many benefits of using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words making it easier to recognize the negative + self-doubt thought patterns holding you back. \n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n\nTo have access to the \"I am Premium\" content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

      "label": "Hva er SITS?\nSjøforsvarets idretts- og treningssenter (SITS) har det helhetlige ansvaret for oppfølgingen av militær idrett og trening (MIT) i Sjøforsvaret. Primæroppgaven er å gi støtte til operative avdelinger og fremme styrkeproduksjon av fysiske kapasiteter. Dette inkluderer utdanning, opplæring, trening ifm oppøving / deployering og vedlikehold av fysisk yteevne.  I tillegg driver senteret rådgivning, veiledning, utvikling og kvalitetssikring innen fagområdet MIT, skadeforebygging og kosthold.\nHovedfokuset til SITS er å operasjonalisere kunnskap om fysisk trening, prestasjonsutvikling, kosthold og skadeforebygging til funksjonsrettet kompetanse og trening for militært personell. SITS har som målsetning at å bidra til at Sjøforsvarets personell og avdelinger har riktig fysisk yteevne i forhold til tildelte oppdrag. På samme tid er det viktig å skape høy motivasjon og entusiasme for fysisk aktivitet blant personellet sett i lys av både et operativt perspektiv, og ett aktiv livsstil-, helse- og trivselsperspektiv for derigjennom å nå Forsvarets visjon: «Trent for å prestere når det kreves».\n\nHva er SITS interaktiv?\nSITS interaktiv er en treningsapplikasjon for militært ansatte, vernepliktige og sivilt ansatte i Forsvaret. Dette er et nytt verktøy som fremmer Forsvarets målsetning om økt fysisk kampkraft og aktiv livsstil. SITS interaktiv er din interaktive treningsveileder som vil hjelpe deg å nå dine treningsmål.\n   \nHvorfor SITS interaktiv?\nSITS interaktiv vil gi tilgang til skreddersydde treningsprogrammer og treningsplaner basert på den enkeltes forutsetninger og målsetninger. Dette vil muliggjøre \"en til en\" og \"en til mange\" med interaksjonsmuligheter i treningsapplikasjonen. SITS interaktiv vil ikke erstatte fagpersoner innen militær idrett og trening, men skape en plattform som muliggjør tidsriktig oppfølging og trening av militært personell.   \n\nHvordan SITS interaktiv?\nDen beste måten å finne ut hvordan SITS interaktiv fungerer på, er å teste ut treningsapplikasjonen og se hvilke funksjonaliteter som finnes i treningsapplikasjonen. Lykke til med treningen!\n\nSikkerhetsløsning:\nSikkerhetsløsningen i SITS interaktiv bygger på ExorLive sitt sikkerhetssystem. ExorLive er ISO-sertifisert som medisinsk software. Sikkerhetssystemet ivaretar personvern og sikkerhet som kreves, både i forhold til GDPR og Scrhems II."

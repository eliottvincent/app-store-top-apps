It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

Benefit from the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method, trusted by hundreds of millions adopters worldwide!\n\nPerfect for establishing a basic eating discipline, Simple is ideal for keeping yourself in good shape during self-isolation, with our educational and motivational content on staying mindful about your eating habits.\n\nPopularized by celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé, intermittent fasting is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans. It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature.

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "SKADEFRI er utviklet for at du skal lære å trene riktig og for å unngå skader. Gjør du øvelsene vi viser deg på SKADEFRI regelmessig, kan du halvere skaderisikoen!\n\nInnhold (ansvarlig)\nDr scient Kathrin Steffen og Prof dr med Roald Bahr, Senter for idrettsskadeforskning\n\nTakk til økonomisk støtte fra Sparebankstiftelsen DNB, Skadetelefonen, Kulturdepartementet, Norges idrettsforbund og olympiske og paralympiske komité, til våre teknologipartnere Makingwaves og på Norges idrettshøgskole, til den faglig ekspertisen fra Senter for idrettsskadeforskning (NIH), Olympiatoppen (OLT) og norsk idrett, og til våre utøvere og rollemodeller.\n\nVersjon 1.1\nCopyright © 2016 Den internasjonale olympiske komité & Senter for idrettsskadeforskning\nFIFA 11+ videos: Copyright © 2014 FIFA\n \nBeskrivelse\nSkader skjer i de fleste idretter, og dessverre altfor ofte. En idrettsskade kan være ødeleggende for en idrettsutøver, og i verste fall bety slutten på en lovende karriere. Men, idrettsskader kan forebygges. En rekke vitenskapelige studier har vist at man ved hjelp av strukturerte oppvarmingsprogram kan redusere risikoen for skader med over 50%!\n\nAppen SKADEFRI ble utviklet i forbindelse med lanseringen av websiden www.skadefri.no. SKADEFRI appen har sitt utspring i appen Get Set – Train Smarter gjennom et samarbeid mellom Den internasjonale olympiske komité (IOC), Senter for idrettsskadeforskning, vår teknologipartner Making Waves AS, og flere internasjonale idrettsforbund.\nMålgruppen er ikke bare den unge talentfulle utøveren og deres trenere, men alle som er engasjert i fysisk aktivitet. SKADEFRI ble utviklet for å bidra til forebygging av idrettsskader ved å gi deg de mest effektive og forskningsbaserte treningsrutinene.\n\nAlle øvelser presenteres gjennom videoer, understøttet av korte beskrivelser av hvordan du utfører øvelsen riktig. Øvelser presenteres med variasjoner, samt med tre gradvis mer krevende nivåer for å gjøre dem mer utfordrende. Øvelsene er laget for å kunne gjøres med et minimum av utstyr og for å gjøre dem trygge og enkle å gjennomføre uansett hvor du er.\n\nUnder inngangen \"Idrett\", kan du velge din idrett blant 30 sommer- og 15 vinteridretter, men du finner også skadeforebyggende øvelser rettet mot 6 utvalgte kroppsdeler. Med andre ord, for hver av de 45 idrettene kan du velge treningsprogram tilpasset risikoprofilen i din idrett. Øvelsene er utviklet for å hindre skulder-, rygg-, lyske-, hamstrings-, kne- og ankelskader.\nAlle treningsprogrammer kan lastes ned som PDF-filer, der du ser små bilder og korte beskrivelser for hver av øvelsene. PDFen kan deles elektronisk med dine lagkamerater, trenere, venner og familie.\n\nSKADEFRI er gratis og tilgjengelig på norsk. SKADEFRI kan lastes ned for både iOS. Første gangen du velger en øvelse, vil du måtte laste ned videoen til din enhet. Til dette anbefaler vi at du bruker en trådløs tilkobling, for å være sikker på å unngå eksterne kostnader. Når du først har lastet ned videoene, er disse lagret på enheten, slik at du kan dra nytte av dem uansett hvor du befinner deg."

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

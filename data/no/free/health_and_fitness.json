      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

På samme tid er det viktig å skape høy motivasjon og entusiasme for fysisk aktivitet blant personellet sett i lys av både et operativt perspektiv, og ett aktiv livsstil-, helse- og trivselsperspektiv for derigjennom å nå Forsvarets visjon: «Trent for å prestere når det kreves».\n\nHva er SITS interaktiv?\nSITS interaktiv er en treningsapplikasjon for militært ansatte, vernepliktige og sivilt ansatte i Forsvaret. Dette er et nytt verktøy som fremmer Forsvarets målsetning om økt fysisk kampkraft og aktiv livsstil. SITS interaktiv er din interaktive treningsveileder som vil hjelpe deg å nå dine treningsmål.\n   \nHvorfor SITS interaktiv?\nSITS interaktiv vil gi tilgang til skreddersydde treningsprogrammer og treningsplaner basert på den enkeltes forutsetninger og målsetninger. Dette vil muliggjøre \"en til en\" og \"en til mange\" med interaksjonsmuligheter i treningsapplikasjonen. SITS interaktiv vil ikke erstatte fagpersoner innen militær idrett og trening, men skape en plattform som muliggjør tidsriktig oppfølging og trening av militært personell.   \n\nHvordan SITS interaktiv?\nDen beste måten å finne ut hvordan SITS interaktiv fungerer på, er å teste ut treningsapplikasjonen og se hvilke funksjonaliteter som finnes i treningsapplikasjonen. Lykke til med treningen!\n\nSikkerhetsløsning:\nSikkerhetsløsningen i SITS interaktiv bygger på ExorLive sitt sikkerhetssystem. ExorLive er ISO-sertifisert som medisinsk software. Sikkerhetssystemet ivaretar personvern og sikkerhet som kreves, både i forhold til GDPR og Scrhems II."

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\r\n\r\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "Exercise more effectively and evaluate your progress with scientific precision.\n\nGetting results from workouts might be simpler than you think. Myworkout GO looks to the scientific consensus on physical exercise and cuts through the clutter of workout fads and overly complicated training routines. Instead, it focuses on what actually works and can be done by anyone.\n\nAt the heart of Myworkout GO, is a precise way of evaluating your physical fitness. By assessing the amount of work you can do during a regular high-intensity interval workout, the app calculates your maximal oxygen uptake (VO₂max) and biological age. These are the most important measures of physical health we have today.\n\nYour VO₂max is reduced by an average of 1% every year after the age of 20. It is, however, possible with the right type and amount of exercise, to reach and stay at the same VO₂max as an average 20-year-old (biological age of 20) until you are in your 80s. For most, just two 4-by-4-minute interval workout sessions a week is sufficient to achieve this. And if you combine it with strength training, you will further improve by increasing your work economy.\n\nThe app will guide you when performing a 4-by-4-interval workout. Just select the type, start the exercise, and follow the instructions.\n\nFREE FEATURES\n• Use it outdoors, on treadmills or on exercise machines.\n• Use it to track regular walks, runs, or exercises.\n• Full workout log.\n• Heart rate feedback *\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES\n• Weekly activity score.\n• VO₂max and biological age evaluation.\n• Statistics and graphs.\n• Heart rate guidance. *\n• Exercise and instructional videos.\n\n* Requires a compatible heart rate monitor.\n\nThe methods used by Myworkout GO are based on the 25 years of world renowned research from professors of medicine, Jan Hoff and Jan Helgerud, from the 2015 Nobel Prize winning Faculty of Medicine at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology – NTNU.\n\nNOTES\nA monthly recurring premium subscription for Myworkout GO is required for premium features and is available as an in-app purchase once you have registered an account. The subscription will automatically renew each month and will be charged through your app store account unless cancelled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renew at any time from your app store account settings. Cancellation of the current active subscription period is not allowed. If you are eligible for a free trial period, payment will be charged to your app store account as soon as it has expired. If not, then it will be charged at confirmation of purchase. Find the full terms and conditions, and our privacy policy, at http://myworkout.com/terms-and-privacy/\n\nPatients with cardiovascular disease should consult a physician before engaging in high intensity interval training.\n\nThe app uses your phone's GPS to track your position during use. Continued usage of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nMyworkout GO uses HealthKit to store activities performed on the Apple Watch in the Health app, and to read and display your heart rate data."

Powered by nature and innovative technology that personalizes your daily experience while keeping you in control of your cycle data.\n\n\nPainful Periods Aren't Natural\n\n\nBut they are common. Synthetic estrogens in birth control, plastics, and beauty products have created hormone imbalances for millions of women. 28's functional nutrition was designed to naturally restore balance to your hormones, along with phase-specific functional movements. \n\nWorkout With Your Cycle, Not Against It\n\n\nMany popular fitness methods were designed for men, not women, with no regard for the menstrual cycle. 28 is the first method of its kind designed to optimize your energy, hormones, strength, and flexibility as you experience changes throughout your cycle.\n\nYou Deserve More Than A Period Tracker\n\nYour cycle has four phases. Each phase brings changes to the brain and body. Exercising and eating based on your cycle means changing the types of movements and nutrients during each phase to optimize your physique, hormones, and mood. 28 empowers you with simplified science, breathtaking content, and cutting-edge technology. \n\nBecome the Expert of You\n\n\nYou are a mystery. Your body doesn’t have to be. We’ve been locked in the passenger seats of our own bodies for far too long. School taught us little-to-nothing about how our cycles and hormones actually work. 28 empowers you to connect with your body by understanding the beautifully complex nature of your biology, one day at a time.\n\n\n\nFEATURES: \n\nFollow Your Cycle\n  - Daily Cycle Status\n  - Easily Track Your Periods\n  - Phase Progress Bar \n\nScience-based Insights\n  - Daily body predictions\n  - Daily emotional predictions\n  - Goals, Guidance, and inspiration\n\nExercise Videos\n  - Personalized to match your energy and mood\n  - Designed by trainers of iconic supermodels\n  - Lengthen, strengthen, stretch & tone\n  - Sculpt booty, tighten abs, tone arms, lean legs\n  - Workout anywhere, at any time\n  - No equipment required\n  - Lightening-fast, high-definition streaming\n  - View on mobile, desktop, tablet, TV\n\nNutrition Profiles\n  - Daily nutrition guidelines for hormone balancing\n  - Specific suggestions by food groups \n  - Give your body what it needs, when it needs it\n  - No more calorie counting\n  - Coming Soon: Meal plans\n  - Coming soon: Shopping lists\n\nUser Privacy Is Our #1 Priority\n\nMany women have valid concerns regarding the privacy and safety of their personal health data. We're proud to have one of the strongest privacy policies in all of tech, which includes a steadfast commitment to never sell user cycle data to anyone for any reason and to never turn over user cycle data to any government or regulatory authority under any circumstance. We've intentionally built our algorithm to be manually controlled by the user at any time, as opposed to leveraging more invasive, machine learning methods. The only cycle data we currently collect is provided voluntarily by the user. It is also never shared with any existing or future investors. It is strictly confidential and used only for the purposes of providing a customized user experience. Any cycle data the user provides now or in the future can be changed or deleted by the user at any time. We do not store deleted cycle data. Once the user deletes that information, it is gone forever.\n\nEmbrace your nature and begin today!"

Noba inneholder en oversikt over norske matvarer og deres FODMAP-innhold. Siden brukerne av appen selv kan legge inn forslag til nytt innhold vil nye matvarer bli lagt til fortløpende. Merk at alle matvarer blir gått gjennom av oss i Noba før de blir synlige i appen. De fleste varer i appen er også gjennomgått av klinisk ernæringsfysiolog med god kjennskap til lavFODMAP-dietten. I tillegg til norske matvarer inneholder også appen oppskrifter som er lavFODMAP. \n\nVi håper at du, med IBS, med denne appen får en enklere hverdag. Vi håper også at du får matglede og at du finner mange nye matvarer du ikke visste var magevennlige. Vi håper også at du deler denne appen med andre på dietten.

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

Ikonene kan variere, avhengig av type arrangement eller oppsett, f.eks en tradisjonell postring, et påskeegg, en julevott eller en harepus.\n\nNår posten er poppet, dvs at du har oppsøkt den fysisk, vil den endre karakter. På denne måten holder du enkelt oversikt over hvilke poster du har besøkt.\n\nArrangøren avgjør om punktene du oppsøker kan poppes bare elektronisk, eller om det skal settes opp fysiske markører på stedet. Dette gir appen deg tilbakemelding om hvis du trykker på postikonet.\n\nDersom du velger å registrere en bruker, kan du enkelt synkronisere postene du har poppet og hente dem opp igjen på en evt. annen enhet. Det er frivillig å registrere seg og ikke nødvendig for å bruke appen.\n\nAktivitetene som tilbys er i regi av ulike norske orienteringsklubber. Det er opp til arrangøren å bestemme regler. Noen har premiering, andre ikke. Uansett så er ikke Apple ansvarlig for premieringen. Du finner link til hver arrangørs regler inne på kartet i appen. Les teksten som vises når du trykker på info-knappen. \n\nAppen vil be om ditt navn, e-post, mobil og fødselsår for å registrere poppede poster. Dette er fordi mange arrangører ønsker å tilpasse eventuelle premier etter kjønn og alder. Dine opplysninger deles aldri med tredjepart. Du kan når som helst kontakte utgiveren av appen og be om å få slettet dine data. Da forsvinner også dine oppføringer for alle dine registrerte punkter."

No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.

If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "Games that move you.\n\nActive Arcade is a fresh take on how to get active while having fun, just by playing a few simple games. It puts you inside the game and uses your natural body movement as the game controller. Interactive elements will make you feel like you're immersed in an entirely new type of arcade game. It's a whole new world of play.\n\n__\n\nWhile we all want to be healthy, fitness today is expensive, rigorous, time-consuming, and intimidating. In short, “fitness” today is just too hard for many.\n\nActive Arcade is an entirely different approach. It’s a simple, natural way to get active just by playing fun games that use your body movement. Like the casual sports games that we play on the playground as kids, there is no better way to have fun and get your body moving than by playing and competing in physical games. Active Arcade is built for anyone to get moving with only their mobile device—no expensive equipment, no hardcore routines, no wearables.\n\nEven if just for a few minutes a day, moving through Active Arcade is both fun and good for you. Simply use your body to play fun physical games and activities, and get immersed in the gameplay. You won't even know you’re working up a sweat!\n\nDon't exercise. Just play.\n\n__\n\nA NEW TYPE OF GAMEPLAY\n\nYour body is now a video game controller! Active Arcade uses advanced full-body motion tracking powered by AI, combined with gamification and augmented reality (AR) to make the experience fun for everyone. The camera will digitize your movement and power the gameplay in real-time. \n\nSIMPLE SETUP, PLAY ANYWHERE\n\nActive Arcade requires no special setup, wearables, or extra equipment. Just lean your iPhone or iPad against a stationary object like a chair, water bottle, or wall, and ensure the front-facing camera can see your full body.  For an even more immersive living room experience, connect your device to a TV through AirPlay or HDMI connection.\n\nSOMETHING FOR EVERYONE\n\nActive Arcade is simple and accessible so that people of all ages and every ability level can engage. The games are easy to play and don't require advanced athletic skills. There are more casual games like Reaction that focus on hand-eye coordination, and more full-body games like Box Attack that use your athleticism. A wide variety of games are available for every player, with new games added regularly.\n\nFUN WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY\n\nLike real sports activities, Active Arcade games are about playing and moving with friends and family members. But unlike many connected fitness solutions, Active Arcade makes engaging with friends and family a quick and simple activity that can happen anytime, anyplace. 2-Player game modes get you and your friends playing side-by-side.\n\nCAPTURE AND SHARE YOUR BEST MOVES\n\nLike a built-in photo booth, you’ll get instant highlights from your time in Active Arcade that shows off your best moves and are fun to post on social media—complete with all the interactive elements included. Post your highlights on social media and challenge your friends to get active too!\n\nENTIRELY FREE TO PLAY\n\nActive Arcade is free to play and contains no advertising, in-app purchases, or subscription model. It's an entirely free resource for the community and for everyone anywhere to play and engage. Share it with all your friends, family members, or anyone.\n\nGot any questions or feedback?\nPlease shoot us an email at ios-support@activearcade.ai. We'd love to hear from you."

      "label": "SKADEFRI er utviklet for at du skal lære å trene riktig og for å unngå skader. Gjør du øvelsene vi viser deg på SKADEFRI regelmessig, kan du halvere skaderisikoen!\n\nInnhold (ansvarlig)\nDr scient Kathrin Steffen og Prof dr med Roald Bahr, Senter for idrettsskadeforskning\n\nTakk til økonomisk støtte fra Sparebankstiftelsen DNB, Skadetelefonen, Kulturdepartementet, Norges idrettsforbund og olympiske og paralympiske komité, til våre teknologipartnere Makingwaves og på Norges idrettshøgskole, til den faglig ekspertisen fra Senter for idrettsskadeforskning (NIH), Olympiatoppen (OLT) og norsk idrett, og til våre utøvere og rollemodeller.\n\nVersjon 1.1\nCopyright © 2016 Den internasjonale olympiske komité & Senter for idrettsskadeforskning\nFIFA 11+ videos: Copyright © 2014 FIFA\n \nBeskrivelse\nSkader skjer i de fleste idretter, og dessverre altfor ofte. En idrettsskade kan være ødeleggende for en idrettsutøver, og i verste fall bety slutten på en lovende karriere. Men, idrettsskader kan forebygges. En rekke vitenskapelige studier har vist at man ved hjelp av strukturerte oppvarmingsprogram kan redusere risikoen for skader med over 50%!\n\nAppen SKADEFRI ble utviklet i forbindelse med lanseringen av websiden www.skadefri.no. SKADEFRI appen har sitt utspring i appen Get Set – Train Smarter gjennom et samarbeid mellom Den internasjonale olympiske komité (IOC), Senter for idrettsskadeforskning, vår teknologipartner Making Waves AS, og flere internasjonale idrettsforbund.\nMålgruppen er ikke bare den unge talentfulle utøveren og deres trenere, men alle som er engasjert i fysisk aktivitet. SKADEFRI ble utviklet for å bidra til forebygging av idrettsskader ved å gi deg de mest effektive og forskningsbaserte treningsrutinene.\n\nAlle øvelser presenteres gjennom videoer, understøttet av korte beskrivelser av hvordan du utfører øvelsen riktig. Øvelser presenteres med variasjoner, samt med tre gradvis mer krevende nivåer for å gjøre dem mer utfordrende. Øvelsene er laget for å kunne gjøres med et minimum av utstyr og for å gjøre dem trygge og enkle å gjennomføre uansett hvor du er.\n\nUnder inngangen \"Idrett\", kan du velge din idrett blant 30 sommer- og 15 vinteridretter, men du finner også skadeforebyggende øvelser rettet mot 6 utvalgte kroppsdeler. Med andre ord, for hver av de 45 idrettene kan du velge treningsprogram tilpasset risikoprofilen i din idrett. Øvelsene er utviklet for å hindre skulder-, rygg-, lyske-, hamstrings-, kne- og ankelskader.\nAlle treningsprogrammer kan lastes ned som PDF-filer, der du ser små bilder og korte beskrivelser for hver av øvelsene. PDFen kan deles elektronisk med dine lagkamerater, trenere, venner og familie.\n\nSKADEFRI er gratis og tilgjengelig på norsk. SKADEFRI kan lastes ned for både iOS. Første gangen du velger en øvelse, vil du måtte laste ned videoen til din enhet. Til dette anbefaler vi at du bruker en trådløs tilkobling, for å være sikker på å unngå eksterne kostnader. Når du først har lastet ned videoene, er disse lagret på enheten, slik at du kan dra nytte av dem uansett hvor du befinner deg."

Use it as a conductor, board member or choir member.\n\nAs a conductor or board member, you can create your choir for free in the app, and invite choristers with an invitation link.\n\nUsers can choose to upgrade to the ChoirMate Premium subscription individually, or take advantage of the discounted package offer for the entire choir, but even the bulk of free features will very likely revolutionise your choir life.\n\nIf you choose to subscribe in the app, a monthly charge will be applied to your iTunes account at the end of the trial period. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime in your iTunes settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

Tone generation is useful in tuning instruments, hearing tests, science experiments, and testing audio equipment.\n\nTone Generator has many uses:\n- Hearing Test:  What is the lowest/highest frequency you can hear in each ear?\n- Tuning Instruments:  Does your top guitar string match Low E at 440 Hz?\n- Science Experiments:  What is the resonant frequency of your wine glass?\n- Audio System Test:  What frequencies does your subwoofer support?\n\nDirections:\nAdjust audio frequency by dragging the slider or tapping the plus/minus buttons.  Adjust device volume using the on-screen volume slider.  You can also specify to play audio to any AirPlay supported device.  Toggle audio playback using the Play/Pause button.\n\nCreated by the audio experts at TMSOFT that brought you the famous White Noise app.  Check out all our apps and sounds at http://www.tmsoft.com/"

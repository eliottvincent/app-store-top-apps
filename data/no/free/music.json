I desember finner du også vår tradisjonsrike og populære julekanal her, P7 Klem Julekanalen.\n \nI tillegg gir appen deg tilgang til de fleste norske podkaster og er sammen med radiokanalene en god mulighet til å ha all lyd du trenger enkelt tilgjengelig overalt. Appen støtter Chromecast og Airplay. Du kan selv administrere hvilke varsler du ønsker fra oss, og du kan angi annonsepreferanser slik at innholdet blir mest mulig relevant for deg.\n \nFra og med versjon 5.0.0 krever vi at du oppretter og logger inn med en brukerkonto. Dette er raskt og helt gratis. Vi har i likhet med de fleste andre apper og digitale tjenester innført innlogging for å kunne gi deg mer relevant innhold, og bedre produktutvikling og dialog. Innlogging betyr at appene våre husker dine preferanser og hva du har hørt på tvers av plattformer, slik at du for eksempel kan begynne på en podkast hjemme og fortsette på jobben eller i bilen. Ved å kjenne lytterne våre får vi dypere innsikt i hvordan radiokanalene våre brukes og kan ta bedre beslutninger rundt hvilken musikk, programledere og reklame vi skal servere deg.\n \nAll bruk av appen er omfattet av våre bruker- og personvernvilkår, som vi ber deg lese: https://www.p7klem.no/personvern.\n \nVi setter stor pris på ris, ros og andre tilbakemeldinger på e-post: p4digital@p4.no."

      "label": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nApple Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Whether it's your closest friends planning casual get-togethers or larger groups attending public events, this is your place to plan it all. NOW is used as a tool for the everyday to remind people of the simple pleasures and what keeps us present. \n\nSome features to mention:\nCreating your clique - A clique is a group of people who come together based on common interests and the desire to hang out with one another. There are no right or wrong ideas - the clique is yours and the community will follow. \nOpening hangouts - Hangouts are events that get published in a clique, bringing everyone together in real-life. For example, create a volleyball clique and open a hangout to arrange a game. The clique will then be notified to join in. \nCreating lineups - Use lineups to share places you’ve been and discover others.  Lineups are personalized lists people create to share their favorite spots and save places to visit. \n\nAfter downloading the app, it's time to create your first clique and invite your friends to join! \n\nFeel free to reach out to us at info@nowhangouts.com with any questions, suggestions, or feedback you have! \n\nThink offline, think NOW."

Go through our rules and safety features together, and frequently ask your kid how it's going on Momio, just as you ask how it is going in school.\n\nMomio is designed as a first social media experience. It's a safe place to practice what it means to be on social media. We don't share your child's information with others, and we don't save anything that we don't have to save. Children on Momio have usernames, so they don't have to share their real names with anyone. To ensure kids a good night’s sleep, Momio is closed at night.\n\nThere are clear rules on Momio. For example bad language, bullying, hurting others' feelings or posting something of a sexual nature is not allowed. If a child breaks these rules, our police officer Jack sends a message explaining what went wrong and why it's not OK. Jack also regularly shares safety tips with the kids and encourages them to think how to behave well and responsibly on the internet.\n\nIf you have any questions, our well-trained support team is ready to help. Read more about us and our safety at http://company.momio.me/ - and don't forget to check out our blog! We give out tips and explanations regarding children and the internet. You can even sign up for a newsletter!\n\n\nFOLLOW US!\nFollow Momio on social media - we'll be so happy!\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/momio_official\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MomioOfficial\n\nFor parents:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Momio_official\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MomioParents\nBlog: http://company.momio.me/blog\n\n\nIN-APP PURCHASES\nMomio is totally free to use.

      "label": "Tumblr. Pure effervescent enrichment. Old internet energy. Home of the Reblogs. All the art you never knew you needed. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up. \n\nOh, and influencers? Don’t even go here. Every video you find, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate, every waterfall GIF you secretly gaze at in wonder—that’s all you. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Welcome to weird. Make it yours. \n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is. \n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. Tumblr is the home of all things weird and wonderful, funny and fascinating—old-school internet vibes. We’re built a little different, just like everyone else who goes here.\n\nYour dashboard will become the place to see what you want to see: a chronological tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, reblog and add your own take, this is your universe to discover, express, and enjoy. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here.\n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world, F1 fanfic that your mutuals need to see—you have so many options. Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. You can make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. Don’t say we don’t spoil you!\n\nThe reblog starts conversations in which anyone can join. Reblogging creates jokes and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post only for a couple of your friends to engage with? All possible here). No matter who you are, where you are, or what you are (looking at you here, Pikaman), this is your space—with as much freedom or privacy as you need. \n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. Maybe you have a favorite blorbo from your show? There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3, *and* see their OC art on Tumblr, *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? You get the idea: it’s all here. Wait. Frogs. Did we mention the frogs? \n\nIt’s a whole world out here. If the prospect of reblogging, shipping, curating, and fanart feels a little daunting, or you simply require a refresher on how all this works, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart’s content. Or simply drift through the dream you’ve created for yourself—a chronological dashboard curated by you. For you. You hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service"

You can ask anything, answer others, and help them too.\nInstead of asking Siri, or going through Google search results, asking in online groups and sites like Reddit, Quora, and AMA websites for answers and tips or even searching Yelp for recommendations, just ask any question, and Superfy will instantly find people that can answer.\n\nIt's just like chatting on iMessage, but instead of asking people you know if they might have an answer, you can get to anyone who knows the answer.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n1. Ask any question or search anything\n2. Superfy sends it to the most relevant people \n3. Get answers in instant messages from real people!\n4. Chat to find out more and talk about your interests.\n\nYou can use Superfy to ask and answer questions on literally ANYTHING.\nSuperfy will help you satisfy your curiosity and also let you help others. You will also meet new people from around the world. It's awesome!\n\nTrending questions:\n*Best thing to watch on Netflix right now? \n*Which college or university should I go to?\n*What’s it like to work at Google? \n*How do I stop dying in Fortnite?  \n*Which broadway show should I see?\n*What's the best Italian restaurant in NYC? \n*Will there be another MCU Avengers movie??\n*Going to SXSW this year - any tips?\n\nGet tips from real people about real experiences. \nChat with people who know what they are talking about!  \nIt's great if you are a curious person that has a lot of questions, and also if you are an expert in many fields and want to share your knowledge and help others.\n\n-------------------\nWe all use Google to search for stuff, and it's great! But there are many things that Google can't find because the information and tips you need are stuck in people's minds. That's why people ask Questions on their Facebook wall or Facebook Groups, ask Siri, Alexa and Cortana, or even go to chat apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and other apps looking for answers from people. People also use Quora, Reddit, Ask.com, and Yahoo Answers to get answers from people - these are great tools, but it's nothing like getting a response in a live chat from a real person!\n\nSuperfy is really awesome. Our users love the app because they get to help others, get answers, chat about fields of interest, and also get to meet new people from around the world and even make new friends.\n\nSuperfy is not an online group - you get your answer in a one on one chat with a real person in real-time. \n\nWe love our community; feedback is welcome at feedback@superfy.co\n\nSee you on Superfy!"

      "label": "Poio is a phonics and reading game that, in a short time, has helped more than 100,000 children learn how to read. In a study surveying more than 4,000 parents who use Poio with their children, over 85% report a significant positive impact on their child’s literacy learning.\n\n* Covers the first years of learning to read, from matching letters and sounds to reading a complex fairy-tale story with irregular words\n* The app is commonly used in preschools, primary schools, kindergartens and first grade as an introduction to literacy.\n\n“She astounded us with being able to read the story”\n— Grandmother to Ann (3)\n\n«With Poio, my sons now nag to practise reading» \n— dad to Noah (4) and James (6). \n\n«Unlike other apps we had used before, Poio showed the user letter and sounds in a wide variety of different formats – as letters, words and in sentences and within multiple different scenarios in the game.»\n— Victoria Galligan, QA Education Magazine\n\n\nTHE POIO METHOD\nPoio is a unique approach to phonics teaching, where children are in charge of their own learning journey.\n\n1. Poio is a game designed to engage your child through play and ignite their curiosity for reading.\n2. The game continuously adapts to each child's level of skill, providing a sense of mastery and keeping the child motivated.\n3. Keep track of your child’s achievements with our email reports, and get advice on how to initiate a positive dialogue to reinforce learning.\n4. The goal is for your child to read the story book to you, their siblings or impressed grandparents.\n\nEXPLORATION SPARKS CURIOSITY FOR THE STORY BOOK\nThe story takes place on a magical island, inhabited by a group of letter bugs called Readlings. Your child will help a troll, named Poio, learn how to read the storybook he has stolen from the Readlings. \n\nThese cute characters introduce letters, words and the story in a coherent fantasy world that unravels scene-by-scene. The game is full of tasks of increasing complexity, which helps the child to practice letter shapes, spell words and improve their phonetic awareness. Ultimately your child will make friends with all the Readlings and read the story book for the troll; and then for you, younger siblings or impressed grandparents.\n\n\nTHE GAME ELEMENTS\n\n#1 THE FAIRY TALE BOOK\nInside the game there is a book. It’s empty when your child starts playing. However, as the game unfolds, it will fill up with words and unravel the mysteries of the fantasy world.\n\n#2 THE READLINGS\nReadlings are cute bugs who eat alphabet letters. They are very picky about what they like, and have different personalities. The child controls them all!\n\n#3 A TROLL\nPoio, the main character of the game, catches the cute Readlings. He needs their help to read the book he has stolen from them. As they collected words at each level, children will spell them out in order to read the book.\n\n#4 STRAW ISLAND\nThe troll and the Readlings live on an island, in the forest, a desert valley and a winter land. The goal of each straw-level is to eat as many vowels as possible and find a new word for the book. A sub goal is to rescue all the trapped Readlings. To unlock the cages where the Readings are trapped, we give children phonic tasks to practice letter sounds and spelling.\n\n#5 HOUSES\nFor every Reading they rescue, children are rewarded with the opportunity to enter a special “house”. This gives them a break from the intense phonetics training. Here, they can use the gold coins they collect to furnish and decorate the house, while playing with the subjects and verbs of everyday objects.\n\n#6 COLLECTABLE CARDS\nThe cards encourage children to find new things and to practice more. The board of cards also serves as a playful instruction menu for the elements in the game.\n\n---\n\nTHE INVENTOR\nPoio is made by a father, teacher and tech-expert who quit his job to find a better way for children to crack the reading code. Our goal is to empower children all around the world to learn to read through play."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Boggatap fokuserer på trygg og inspirerende lek og har derfor verken tredjeparts reklame eller \"kjøp i app\"-ordninger. Vi samler heller ikke inn noe personlig data fra brukeren. De eneste lenkene til internet finner inne i \"foreldre-sonen\" som er sikret med en \"foreldre-lås\", altså utenfor barnas umiddelbare rekkevidde. Boggataps apper er med i \"KNOW what's inside\" - et program skapt av MOMs with apps og ACT som er en redaksjon av foreldre og pedagoger som leter etter trygge apper for barn, fri for reklame."

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

      "label": "Play with letters, sounds and words together with Alfie Atkins. Children love learning new things through play. This app, Play ABC, Alfie Atkins, stimulates children's language learning skills by clearly connecting the function and purpose of letters in an experimental, playful way.\n\nAlfie has some extraordinary devices in his room: a letter tracer, a word machine and a puppet theatre. With the letter tracer, children will learn the appearance and sound of all letters and train their motor skills and muscle memory by drawing and tracing letters on the screen. Using Alfie's homemade word machine, children will spell new words using phonemes and letter tips. All new words are sent to the puppet theatre, where children use their creativity and imagination to tell fantastic stories. This playloop, with concrete results, has a motivational effect and helps children develop their language skills at their own pace.\n\nPlay ABC, Alfie Atkins is developed by language teachers and game designers. It was created and tested in collaboration with teachers and students of schools in Finland and Sweden. The app has been developed based on children's needs and does not feature points, time limits or other elements that could lead to failure or stress. Children will play and learn using the app on their own terms and at their own pace, in preschool, at school or at home.\n\nPlay and learn:\n  • The sounds, phonemes and names of letters\n  • How to trace letters\n  • How to spell around 100 different words\n  • How to read simple words\n  • Upper and lowercase letters\n  • Fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination\n  • The basics of literacy\n  • Creative storytelling\n\nThe app is available in 6 different languages, and the full version allows the creation of individual profiles for multiple children.\n\nThis is the premium, full, version of the app which enables:\n  • Preschools, schools and organisations can purchase the app through the volume purchase program (VPP)\n  • Family sharing is supported\n\nGro Play is an xEdu.co alumnus and member of the trade organization Swedish EdTech Industry. Gro Play collaborates with Playful Learning Center, the University of Helsinki, in the development of game-based learning.

Everything will arrive in the selected location so you can begin your next adventure!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: stable, arena, forest and shop.\n- Create stories for 24 new characters plus horses and other animals!\n- Care for your horses: feed them, lather them up till they're nice and clean, brush them. \n- Choose outfits from your favorite themes: medieval, western, everyday stable life and fantasy!\n- Hop on to ride bikes in the forest and race motorcycles in the arena!\n- Set up obstacles and show off your horse's jumping skills!\n- Eat at the food court and use the portable potties!\n- Have a campout! \n- Snuggle into your sleeping bag to stay warm under the stars! \n- Take a canoe ride or swim by a waterfall.\n- Make music with magical lily pads!\n- Move horses, characters and objects from here to there in the horse transport! \n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nOne of our top requests for the Toca Life series has been horses!

Vi spesialiserer oss på apper for barn, gjerne med en pedagogisk vri. Målet er å skape læring gjennom kreativ atspredelse - digitale leketøy som skal invitere både barna og foreldrene til å leke sammen. Boggatap fokuserer på trygg og inpirerende lek og har derfor verken tredjeparts reklame eller \"kjøp i app\"-ordninger. Vi samler heller ikke inn noe personlig data fra brukeren. De eneste lenkene til internet finner inne i \"foreldre-sonen\" som er sikret med en \"foreldre-lås\", altså utenfor barnas umiddelbare rekkevidde. Boggataps apper er med i \"KNOW what's inside\" - et program skapt av MOMs with apps og ACT som er en redaksjon av foreldre og pedagoger som leter etter trygge apper for barn, fri for reklame."

Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles. \n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE Math BINGO:\n- Does not contain third-party ads. \n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks. \n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools. \n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store. \n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit: http://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n ---------------------------"

Prof. of Religion, Fairfield University\n\n                              _____________________\n\nTheologica is the simple, yet comprehensive theological study app for the iPhone. Drawing from the rich treasures of the intellectual tradition of the Church, from the 1st to the 21st century, this app is designed to be an essential study tool for both students and teachers of theology as well as for anyone who desires to “think faith”. \n\nTheologica features 5 tabs: Overview, Reference, Dictionary, Maps, and Explorations, which enable its users to enhance their knowledge of theology in multiple contexts.\n\nOverview\n\nThe Overview tab presents a wide-angle view of theology as a dialectical enterprise that continuously seeks to better understand the Faith of the Church in a given historical situation. To fulfill that vocation, theology draws on various sources in order to faithfully interpret the signs of the times. The primary sources are: Magisterium, Sacred Scripture, Church Fathers, Ecumenical Councils, Creeds, and Liturgy. All of these sources, though distinct, are organically related to the life of the Church. Theology is always practiced in a particular historical and cultural context. Thus, cultural trends and indicators of the worldview of modern men and women necessarily affect the way in which the Faith of the Church is understood. It is therefore vital for theology to pay attention to these signs in order to fulfill its vocation. They include: Philosophy, Science, Technology, Politics, Economics, and the Arts. While not exhaustive, these aspects of life in the 21st century are the primary factors which affect the thinking of people everywhere.\n\nReference\n\nThe Reference tab features a curated list of live links for each category in the Overview tab along with those sites that feature theology in action. Most of these sites contain significant documents which are referenced in the Dictionary.\n\nDictionary\n\nThe Dictionary tab includes a list of over 500 of the most commonly used theological terms in both high school and college classrooms, grouped by the categories: Systematic, Historical, Moral, Biblical, Liturgical, and Cultural.  Terms can be bookmarked for quick access when used for exam preparation. Definitions contain extensive links to curated resources for further reference, publicly available online. \n\nMaps\n\nThe Maps tab includes over 40 custom pin locations grouped by the categories: Old Testament, New Testament, Church History, and Social Justice. Each location includes a detail page with additional information on the given site as well as links for more information. Theology is practiced in ancient, historical, and modern geographical contexts, and this is clearly expressed in Maps.\n\nExplorations\n\nThe Explorations tab features in-depth analysis of specific questions in theology, which are generated by the dialectic it has with modern culture. This tab also includes periodic interviews with contemporary theologians and other cultural influencers who are actively engaged in shaping the various contexts of theology. This tab features various such explorations on a regular basis.\n\nTheologica began as an idea for an iPhone app that could serve as a comprehensive study aid for students as well as an instructional tool for teachers. It is and will remain ad-free with no additional fees for future updates."

      "label": "Bokstavkongen er et veldig fengende og unikt pedagogisk konsept som har blitt brukt i den norske skolen i flere år i forbindelse med bokstavopplæring. Bokstavkongen, - da lydene fikk bokstaver, tar barna med inn i en helhetlig, fantasifull verden med et eventyr til hver av bokstavene. Opplegget kan være en god hjelp til å bevisstgjøre barna på lydsiden ved ord. Det er lagt vekt på å skille mellom lyd og bokstav, noe som er svært viktig i den begynnende leseopplæringen. Begrepene vokal og konsonant blir innført, samt at bokstavene da får henholdsvis rød og blå farge.\n\nEventyrene er illustrert med enkle fargerike figurer som er fantasistimulerende for barna. Barna skal ha god tid til å leve seg inn i historiene mens de ser på bildene. De fengende historiene er lest av Nils Nordberg. Historiene er også tekstet slik at de voksne selv kan lese sammen med barna hvis de ønsker det. Slik er det åpnet for å bruke flere av barnets sansekanaler for å feste assosiasjonene mellom lyd og bokstav. Ikke minst ligger det her til rette for å høre historiene mange ganger, slik at barna kan lære bokstavene godt.\n\nEventyrene om de forskjellige bokstavene blir tilgjengelige i en rekkefølge som vi anbefaler å følge, særlig når de åtte-ti første bokstavene skal læres. Etter de fire første bokstavene råder vi til å lese eventyret som kan hjelpe barna til å forstå hvordan bokstavene blir til ord. Dette hjelper barna å knekke lesekoden. Historiene kan med fordel leses mange ganger.\n\nTil sammen er der 33 eventyr for alle lydene og tilleggshistoriene. Introduksjonseventyret om linjesystemet og bokstavslottet leses først. Det avsluttes med et eventyr om hvordan det ble orden på bokstavene, - alfabetet.\n\nI tillegg har Bokstavkonge-appen flere tilleggsfunksjoner, som minnespill hvor man bl.a kan finne store og små bokstaver som passer sammen. Barna kan også øve seg på å skrive bokstavene rett inn i bokstavslottet samt å fargelegge figurer og bokstaver fra historiene i tegneprogrammet. En ny modul er nå at man selv kan lage sine egne historier med elementer fra historiene.\n\nOg sist men ikke minst: Dere kan være med å synge alfabetsangen og se vår tegnefilm om alfabetet.\n\nVi håper både du og ditt barn kan ha stor glede av å ta del i alt som skjer i Bokstavlandet, og at denne appen vil gjøre leseopplæringen til en hyggelig opplevelse for barna."

Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

Fyra bilder ska sättas upp i tavelramarna, till exempel; bil, pil, bil och pil. \n\nFonemo Minipar är en variant av Fonemo. Här jobbar vi med bildpar som bildar så kallade minimala ordpar där endast ett språkljud skiljer orden åt. Syftet är att ljudanalysera och uttala ord men också att kunna särskilja och uttala språkljud som ligger nära varandra, så som viol och fiol, ros och juice. \n\nAtt arbeta med minimala ordpar är ett sätt att få övning i att uppfatta små distinktioner mellan språkljud för att sedan kunna uttala dem.\n\nÖva förmågor:\n•\tLjudanalysera\n•\tSärskilja\n•\tUttala\n•\tOrdförståelse\n•\tSpråklig medvetenhet\n\nNallen säger ordningen\nLyssna på nallen som vill ha en viss ordning i sitt galleri. Ni får fyra bilder per övning att dra och släppa på tavelramarna. Nallen säger till exempel: klass, glass, glass, klass eller kran, gran, kran, gran. Blev det rätt ordning? Nallen ger feedback som ”försök igen” eller ”bra!”.

This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch.

Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "The purpose of Crack the Reading Code is to teach what is practical for reading: \n- Shape\n- Writing direction\n- Sound. \n\nThese are the foundations of reading. \n\nChildren can acquire the essential knowledge that letters represent sounds, fit together and makes words that have meaning.\n \nThe content has been developed by experienced teachers - A supplement to writing textbooks and reading education\n\nChildren in kindergarten who are curious about letters will also think it's exciting. \n\n* THE SOUND OF THE LETTERS BEFORE THE NAMES.\n\nCrack the Reading Code uses exclusively letter sounds. \n\nChildren often learn the names of the letters instead of the sound of the letters. This means that they must apprehend something that they cannot use for their further reading. Often, they will have to relearn it when they are shown sounds at school that they have to use to read. \n\nBroadly speaking, they have no use for the letter names in the initial stages of reading. \n\n* THE 120 MOST USED WORDS AS WORD PICTURES.\n\nMany of the 120 most used words are not spelled as they sound. Therefore, it is a big help to recognize these as word pictures. \n\nChildren won't be forced to sound it out here, but instead just recognize the word like they recognize their own name or that a big yellow M means McDonald's. \n\nThat is why these 120 are trained as word pictures in Crack the Reading Code.\n\nUppercase letters for the intermediate learner.\n\nMany children first learn the 'big letters'. Of course, these must also be learned, but it should happen only when the child already recognizes the 'small letters.'\n\nIt is easier to relate to one shape per sound than two. \n\nWhen they have learned the lowercase letters, they can already recognize the letters in the books they must read. \n\nSwitching between the 'lowercase' and 'uppercase' in 'Settings.'\n\nSettings:\n\n-\tTurn the music in the menus on/off\n-\tHide the text direction. Hiding the text direction increases the level of difficulty.\n-\tSwitch between uppercase and lowercase letters. \n\nWe recommend that you only change to 'big letters' when the 'small letters' have been successfully learned.\n\nTarget audience:\n4 - 10 years (those who can't read or have a hard time doing so)."

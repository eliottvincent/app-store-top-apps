      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Poio is a phonics and reading game that, in a short time, has helped more than 100,000 children learn how to read. In a study surveying more than 4,000 parents who use Poio with their children, over 85% report a significant positive impact on their child’s literacy learning.\n\n* Covers the first years of learning to read, from matching letters and sounds to reading a complex fairy-tale story with irregular words\n* The app is commonly used in preschools, primary schools, kindergartens and first grade as an introduction to literacy.\n\n“She astounded us with being able to read the story”\n— Grandmother to Ann (3)\n\n«With Poio, my sons now nag to practise reading» \n— dad to Noah (4) and James (6). \n\n«Unlike other apps we had used before, Poio showed the user letter and sounds in a wide variety of different formats – as letters, words and in sentences and within multiple different scenarios in the game.»\n— Victoria Galligan, QA Education Magazine\n\n\nTHE POIO METHOD\nPoio is a unique approach to phonics teaching, where children are in charge of their own learning journey.\n\n1. Poio is a game designed to engage your child through play and ignite their curiosity for reading.\n2. The game continuously adapts to each child's level of skill, providing a sense of mastery and keeping the child motivated.\n3. Keep track of your child’s achievements with our email reports, and get advice on how to initiate a positive dialogue to reinforce learning.\n4. The goal is for your child to read the story book to you, their siblings or impressed grandparents.\n\nEXPLORATION SPARKS CURIOSITY FOR THE STORY BOOK\nThe story takes place on a magical island, inhabited by a group of letter bugs called Readlings. Your child will help a troll, named Poio, learn how to read the storybook he has stolen from the Readlings. \n\nThese cute characters introduce letters, words and the story in a coherent fantasy world that unravels scene-by-scene. The game is full of tasks of increasing complexity, which helps the child to practice letter shapes, spell words and improve their phonetic awareness. Ultimately your child will make friends with all the Readlings and read the story book for the troll; and then for you, younger siblings or impressed grandparents.\n\n\nTHE GAME ELEMENTS\n\n#1 THE FAIRY TALE BOOK\nInside the game there is a book. It’s empty when your child starts playing. However, as the game unfolds, it will fill up with words and unravel the mysteries of the fantasy world.\n\n#2 THE READLINGS\nReadlings are cute bugs who eat alphabet letters. They are very picky about what they like, and have different personalities. The child controls them all!\n\n#3 A TROLL\nPoio, the main character of the game, catches the cute Readlings. He needs their help to read the book he has stolen from them. As they collected words at each level, children will spell them out in order to read the book.\n\n#4 STRAW ISLAND\nThe troll and the Readlings live on an island, in the forest, a desert valley and a winter land. The goal of each straw-level is to eat as many vowels as possible and find a new word for the book. A sub goal is to rescue all the trapped Readlings. To unlock the cages where the Readings are trapped, we give children phonic tasks to practice letter sounds and spelling.\n\n#5 HOUSES\nFor every Reading they rescue, children are rewarded with the opportunity to enter a special “house”. This gives them a break from the intense phonetics training. Here, they can use the gold coins they collect to furnish and decorate the house, while playing with the subjects and verbs of everyday objects.\n\n#6 COLLECTABLE CARDS\nThe cards encourage children to find new things and to practice more. The board of cards also serves as a playful instruction menu for the elements in the game.\n\n---\n\nTHE INVENTOR\nPoio is made by a father, teacher and tech-expert who quit his job to find a better way for children to crack the reading code. Our goal is to empower children all around the world to learn to read through play."

      "label": "Gode lese- og skriveferdigheter gir barn de beste mulighetene for all læring i de årene de går på skolen. Lær å lese med Lola er den tiende Lola Panda-læringsapplikasjonen.\n\nDe fleste førskolebarn synes det er gøy å leke med ord og rim. På den måten setter barn i gang sin fonologiske bevissthet uten at de faktisk vet det. En velutviklet fonologisk bevissthet betyr at barn kan bytte fra et ord til et annet ved å legge til, trekke fra og erstatte bokstavrekker, for eksempel, hatt - ratt og natt. \n\nLær å Lese med Lola har opplæringsinnhold innen 9 nivåer:\n* Enkelt 1: Ord med de samme rimende endelsene, ag - dag\n* Enkelt 2: Lette ord med de samme rimende endelsene, or - mor\n* Enkelt 3: Noenlunde enkle ord med de samme rimende endelsene, ell-skjell\n* Middels 1: Dagligdagse ord med de samme rimende endelsene, ake - kake\n* Middels 2: Mindre vanlige ord med de samme rimende endelsene, al - hval\n* Middels 3: Vriene rimende ord med endelser som passer sammen og er forskjellige, bue - skrue - due\n* Vanskelig 1: Utfordrende ord med rimende lyder, og endelser som passer sammen og er forskjellige, fjell - gjeld - kveld\n* Vanskelig 2: Krevende ord med rimende lyder, og endelser som passer sammen og er forskjellige, nøtt - nyfødt - kjøtt\n* Vanskelig 3: Vanskelige ord med rimende lyder og endelser som passer sammen og er forskjellige, fond - sånn – blond\n\nUtmerkede lese- og skriveferdigheter gir barn de beste mulighetene for all læring i de årene de går på skolen. Forskere mener at det er veldig viktig for den tidlige leseopplæringen at barn gjenkjenner språkets form, det vil si, evnen til å rime.\n\nLær å Lese med Lola er perfekt for barn som synes Lolas Alfabet-tog og Lolas ABC-Fest er for lette, men som ennå ikke er i stand til å lese flytende. Denne applikasjonen passer for både førskoleklasser og 1. klasse. Den kan bli brukt i grupper eller alene. \n\nBarn kan bruke appen alene ved å begynne på det enkle nivået. Etter hvert som et barn lærer og løser flere oppgaver, så vil appen automatisk bytte til vanskeligere nivå. Alternativt, så kan en lærer eller forelder velge et passende nivå som spillet skal holde seg på.\n\nLær å Lese med Lola er profesjonelt designet og hjelpes av brukerdata fra titalls millioner barn som allerede koser seg med Lola Panda-læringsapplikasjoner over hele verden. Vi har strebet etter å gjøre applikasjonen så gøy at barn ønsker å lære, selv om du ikke engang oppfordrer til det.\n\nMer om høykvalitets Lola Panda-læringsapplikasjoner kan bli funnet her: www.lolapanda.com\n\nNyt læringseventyret med Lolas rimende ord!"

For each letter you will be able to:\n\n• See it in great detail.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its phonemes.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its name.\n• See and hear a common Arabic word which begins with that letter.\n\nArabic Alphabet is not only fun, but it's also accurate because it was developed by a native Arabic speaker, and all audio samples were recorded by a college professor of Arabic.\n\n\"I was born and raised in Morocco with Arabic as my language of origin. When I moved to America, I wanted to be sure that I didn't lose my identity and my culture. After my first son was born, this became even more important to me as I want him to understand the importance of his heritage. I developed Arabic Alphabet so that adults and children alike could have a fun way to accurately learn the foundations of the language. I hope you enjoy it!\" —from the developer\n\nWe have finally added two in-app upgrades, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The Write feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n• The Quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Arabic Alphabet in no time!"

I appen finns också fem stycken musikvideor att titta på. \n\nOm Babblarna \nBabblarna är ett gäng färgglada figurer som gör språkträning till ett spännande och lekfullt äventyr. Den pedagogiska plattformen är Karlstadmodellen och språkträningen riktar sig till barn i tidig språkutveckling. Babblarna älskas av alla, stora som små och ingen tänker på att det är just språkträning det handlar om i leken och äventyren i Babblarnas värld. Babblarna pratar sitt eget språk som helt bygger på ljudet i deras namn. Genom att lyssna på Babblarna när de pratar och genom att härma deras sätt att prata så tränas effektivt förmågan att använda betoningar och melodi i språket. \nTips: Det finns många roliga produkter med Babblarna. De har också en egen sajt bara för barnen www.babblarna.se \n\nBabbapp är utvecklad och utgiven av Hatten Förlag AB.

      "label": "The purpose of Crack the Reading Code is to teach what is practical for reading: \n- Shape\n- Writing direction\n- Sound. \n\nThese are the foundations of reading. \n\nChildren can acquire the essential knowledge that letters represent sounds, fit together and makes words that have meaning.\n \nThe content has been developed by experienced teachers - A supplement to writing textbooks and reading education\n\nChildren in kindergarten who are curious about letters will also think it's exciting. \n\n* THE SOUND OF THE LETTERS BEFORE THE NAMES.\n\nCrack the Reading Code uses exclusively letter sounds. \n\nChildren often learn the names of the letters instead of the sound of the letters. This means that they must apprehend something that they cannot use for their further reading. Often, they will have to relearn it when they are shown sounds at school that they have to use to read. \n\nBroadly speaking, they have no use for the letter names in the initial stages of reading. \n\n* THE 120 MOST USED WORDS AS WORD PICTURES.\n\nMany of the 120 most used words are not spelled as they sound. Therefore, it is a big help to recognize these as word pictures. \n\nChildren won't be forced to sound it out here, but instead just recognize the word like they recognize their own name or that a big yellow M means McDonald's. \n\nThat is why these 120 are trained as word pictures in Crack the Reading Code.\n\nUppercase letters for the intermediate learner.\n\nMany children first learn the 'big letters'. Of course, these must also be learned, but it should happen only when the child already recognizes the 'small letters.'\n\nIt is easier to relate to one shape per sound than two. \n\nWhen they have learned the lowercase letters, they can already recognize the letters in the books they must read. \n\nSwitching between the 'lowercase' and 'uppercase' in 'Settings.'\n\nSettings:\n\n-\tTurn the music in the menus on/off\n-\tHide the text direction. Hiding the text direction increases the level of difficulty.\n-\tSwitch between uppercase and lowercase letters. \n\nWe recommend that you only change to 'big letters' when the 'small letters' have been successfully learned.\n\nTarget audience:\n4 - 10 years (those who can't read or have a hard time doing so)."

      "label": "Bokstavkongen er et veldig fengende og unikt pedagogisk konsept som har blitt brukt i den norske skolen i flere år i forbindelse med bokstavopplæring. Bokstavkongen, - da lydene fikk bokstaver, tar barna med inn i en helhetlig, fantasifull verden med et eventyr til hver av bokstavene. Opplegget kan være en god hjelp til å bevisstgjøre barna på lydsiden ved ord. Det er lagt vekt på å skille mellom lyd og bokstav, noe som er svært viktig i den begynnende leseopplæringen. Begrepene vokal og konsonant blir innført, samt at bokstavene da får henholdsvis rød og blå farge.\n\nEventyrene er illustrert med enkle fargerike figurer som er fantasistimulerende for barna. Barna skal ha god tid til å leve seg inn i historiene mens de ser på bildene. De fengende historiene er lest av Nils Nordberg. Historiene er også tekstet slik at de voksne selv kan lese sammen med barna hvis de ønsker det. Slik er det åpnet for å bruke flere av barnets sansekanaler for å feste assosiasjonene mellom lyd og bokstav. Ikke minst ligger det her til rette for å høre historiene mange ganger, slik at barna kan lære bokstavene godt.\n\nEventyrene om de forskjellige bokstavene blir tilgjengelige i en rekkefølge som vi anbefaler å følge, særlig når de åtte-ti første bokstavene skal læres. Etter de fire første bokstavene råder vi til å lese eventyret som kan hjelpe barna til å forstå hvordan bokstavene blir til ord. Dette hjelper barna å knekke lesekoden. Historiene kan med fordel leses mange ganger.\n\nTil sammen er der 33 eventyr for alle lydene og tilleggshistoriene. Introduksjonseventyret om linjesystemet og bokstavslottet leses først. Det avsluttes med et eventyr om hvordan det ble orden på bokstavene, - alfabetet.\n\nI tillegg har Bokstavkonge-appen flere tilleggsfunksjoner, som minnespill hvor man bl.a kan finne store og små bokstaver som passer sammen. Barna kan også øve seg på å skrive bokstavene rett inn i bokstavslottet samt å fargelegge figurer og bokstaver fra historiene i tegneprogrammet. En ny modul er nå at man selv kan lage sine egne historier med elementer fra historiene.\n\nOg sist men ikke minst: Dere kan være med å synge alfabetsangen og se vår tegnefilm om alfabetet.\n\nVi håper både du og ditt barn kan ha stor glede av å ta del i alt som skjer i Bokstavlandet, og at denne appen vil gjøre leseopplæringen til en hyggelig opplevelse for barna."

And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4.

Stabler du flere ord, venter det en glitrende skatt i belønning!\n\nLydene gjentas når man staver ordene slik at barna oppdager hvordan lyder settes sammen til ord og på den måten enkelt knekker lesekoden.

Målet er å skape læring gjennom kreativ atspredelse - digitale leketøy som skal invitere både barna og foreldrene til å leke sammen. Boggatap fokuserer på trygg og inpsirerende lek og har derfor verken tredjeparts reklame eller \"kjøp i app\"-ordninger. Vi samler heller ikke inn noe personlig data fra brukeren. De eneste lenkene til internet finner inne i \"foreldre-sonen\" som er sikret med en \"foreldre-lås\", altså utenfor barnas umiddelbare rekkevidde. Boggataps apper er med i \"KNOW what's inside\" - et program skapt av MOMs with apps og ACT som er en redaksjon av foreldre og pedagoger som leter etter trygge apper for barn, fri for reklame."

But Sanskrit is a very complex and demanding language, and in order to master it, one must memorise a great deal of information. This is where Liberation Philology Sanskrit can help.\n\nWhenever you have your phone and a free moment, Liberation Philology Sanskrit presents a continuous multiple-choice test on Sanskrit vocabulary and grammar. It immediately confirms or corrects each answer, and reinforces your knowledge through repetition.\n\n• Vocabulary: 320 levels, each testing the translation of ten words between Sanskrit and English. Interspersed among these are cumulative levels reviewing what has been learned earlier (giving a total of 360 levels).\n\n• Nouns: Tests your ability to parse and decline all classes of Sanskrit nouns.\n\n• Pronouns: Tests your ability to parse and decline Sanskrit pronouns.\n\n• Verbs: Tests your ability to parse and conjugate a wide range of Sanskrit verbs.\n\nAll three tests can be set to display Sanskrit words either in Devanagari script or transliterated into the Roman alphabet. A further Reference module allows you to review the vocabulary word-list and the noun and verb paradigms."

Coin collecting can be differentiated from numismatics, in that the latter is the systematic study of currency as a whole, though the two disciplines are closely interlinked.\n\nA coin's grade is a main determinant of its value. Commercial organizations offer grading services and will grade, authenticate, attribute, and encapsulate most coins.\n\nThe motivations for collecting vary from one person to another. Possibly the most common type of collectors are the hobbyists, who amass a collection purely for the pleasure of it with no real expectation of profit.\n\nIt’s easy to start a coin collection. You can begin with coins that you already have on hand.\n\nOur coin collecting app will help you to collect coins, create collection, identify coin by image and by date of issue."

Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "Begynn leseopplæringen gjennom dette morsomme spillet. Lær bokstaver, bokstavlyder og ord. Øv hjernen på å lære. Spillet brukes i norsk skole.\n \nDragon Minders er et spill som både trener barnets evne til å lære og tilbyr grunnleggende lesetrening. Spillet er tilpasset barn mellom 4-7 år, og samsvarer godt med læringsmål i norskfaget som barna møter 1. og 2. skoleår. \n\nDragon Minders passer også godt til barn som sliter med å lære seg og lese.\n \nDragon Minders er et spill som lærer barna alfabetets 29 bokstaver samt alle bokstavenes egne lyder (fonemer). Dette er svært viktig for å kunne knekke lesekoden. Når barnet er klar for det, kan ordtreningen starte. Ordene i spillet er valgt på bakgrunn av spesialpedagogers og læreres ønsker, og mange av dem er såkalte høyfrekvente ord. Altså ord som forekommer ofte i setninger og tekst. Ved å kunne lese og gjenkjenne disse ordene vil lesehastigheten øke og leseforståelse kan oppnås raskere og bedre. Bokstav- og ordtreningen finnes i den ene av totalt tre aktivitetsområder i Dragon Minders-verdenen. Antall bokstaver og ord i gitt rekkefølge vil øke i takt med barnets progresjon, og gi viktig arbeidsminnetrening samtidig med mengdetrening i bokstav- og ordlæring. \n \nIldtempelet består av et hjul med flammer i tre ulike farger. Barnets oppgave blir å huske hvilke flammefarger som beskrives med deres engelske fargenavn i riktig rekkefølge. Med andre ord så trenes det på uttalen på engelske fargenavn, samtidig som en skal huske rekkefølgen på dem. Sistnevnte er arbeidsminnetrening. Antallet flammer øker etter hvert som barnet husker riktig rekkefølge på dem. Mengden vil justeres automatisk etter hvor mye barnet husker, og dermed kontinuerlig gi barnet noe å strekke seg etter.\n\nEntene som vi finner i det tredje aktivitetsområdet, er små trær som står på rekker. Her er det ren arbeidsminnetrening, hvor oppgaven blir å huske rekkefølgen på hvilke trær som beveger seg når. Det starter med få trær, men antallet justeres opp (eller ned) etter hva barnet klarer å huske. Målet er å være i yttergrensen for hvor mye arbeidsminnet klarer, for på den måten å forbedre kapasiteten samt gi barnet noe å strekke seg etter. \n\nLike egenskaper for alle tre aktivitetene er at barnet får belønninger ut i fra oppnådd resultat. Belønningene er ulike matsorter som dragen trenger for å vokse seg stor og sterk. Etter hver aktivitet kan barnet gå i dragetempelet og gi dragen sin mat, samt kose med den og høre koselydene den lager. \n\nDragon Minders er laget i samarbeid med barn, der barna selv har valgt de ulike figurene. Gjennom spillet vil barnets egen drage bli klekket og vokser i takt med utviklingen barnet har i spillet. Det er også en fonetisk test som viser hvor mange bokstaver og bokstavlyder barnet kan. Den er anbefalt å gjøre ved første gangs bruk og etter tre-fire uker.\n \nEgenskaper:\n* Innovativ læring gjennom utforsking og lek\n* Underholdende\n* Mengdetrening på store og små bokstaver\n* Inneholder alle 29 bokstavene i norske alfabetet\n* Bokstavlyder for alle bokstavene\n* Høyfrekvente ord som er viktig å lære for å knekke lesekoden\n* Dysleksivennlige bokstaver\n* Engelske begreper slik som farger\n* Arbeidsminnetrening som øker konsentrasjon, korttidshukommelse og evnen til å gjenbruke kunnskap\n* Trening av arbeidsminne anbefales spesielt til barn med ADHD, dysleksi, generelle lærevansker, samt fortidligfødte\n* Umiddelbar tilbakemelding underveis i spillet på fremgangen\n* Din egen drage som vokser i takt med at kunnskapen øker\n* Fonetisk test som måler kunnskapsnivå på hvor mange bokstaver og bokstavlyder barnet kan\n* Ingen reklame i app\n* Ingen kjøp i app"

Play, observe, ask questions and find the answers. Explore how animals interact with each other, how they live, how they defend themselves and how they reproduce.\n\nLearn and get informed about the pollution of the oceans and its dangers. See how plastics, overfishing, climate change and ships affect the life and health of different ecosystems. We only have one planet — let's take care of it!\n\nWith five incredible ecosystems:\n\nSouth Pole\nDiscover the life of penguins, seals and orcas. Play with them! What do they eat and how do they live? How does climate change affect them?\n\nOctopuses\nFeed the sharks and learn how octopuses defend themselves and not be devoured. Try to protect the divers inside the shark cage!\n\nDolphins\nSee how the dolphins hunt, reproduce and come out to breathe. Play with them until it becomes night so they can go to sleep. Watch the fishing nets — if the dolphins get caught in them, they will not be able to come out to breathe.\n\nTurtles\nFeed the turtles and watch them lay eggs. Help the younglings to get out of the egg, and make sure the turtles don't eat the plastic bags, as they sometime mistake them for jellyfish. Look at the remoras — they always hitch a ride on the turtles.\n\nSeahorses\nSeahorses are small and fragile. Protect them from their predators, crabs, and make the algae and corals grow so they can hide.\n\nFeatures\n\n• Discover how animals live and how they interact in different ecosystems.\n• Play and learn with different marine animals: octopuses, crabs, sharks, turtles, jellyfish, seahorses, penguins, orcas, seals, remoras, starfish...

Its going tibia ok, the Skelly app is just what you need! With the Skelly app you can literally pull the inspiration you need right out of your pocket anywhere, anytime!\n\nSkelly is a fully poseable, anatomically correct reference skeleton for artists. A simplified version of the skeleton is also included, named “Robo-Skelly”. These figures were created to make the study of anatomy easier and more enjoyable for students and professionals without leaving your wallets bone dry. They can also be used to inspire poses for drawing, painting, sculpting, illustration, animation, comics, manga, storyboarding, twerking, and to fully understand the anatomy of the human skeleton. No need for super gluteus, Skelly comes pre-assembled and ready to pose as soon as you launch the app! \n\nLearning the structure of the human body is the skeleton key to drawing the figure in an anatomically correct manner without having to clear your browser history to avoid awkward conversations with your loved ones. Whether you want to make works like Michelangelo or Miyazaki, Skelly will help you focus on your art and let you personalize his poses, rather than searching for reference material and hiring models. Learn to draw the skeleton from any angle without the inconvenient and morally questionable need to go grave robbing.\n\nFEATURES:\n \nAnatomically correct skeleton\nSimplified “Robo Skelly”\nProportions based on the teachings of Dr. Paul Richer\nSkull fits perfectly into a “Loomis Head” as taught by Andrew Loomis\nPoseable joints\nPose Library - choose from pre made poses and save your own\nMovable camera\nAdjustable light source\nChoose light or dark background\nReset to neutral “Anatomical Pose”\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT:\n\nJames Gurney, author of ‘Color and Light’ and ‘Imaginative Realism’ Says:\n\n\"Bend him, twist him, contort him! The Skelly app lets you put a virtual human skeleton into any pose, and to see him from any angle, and in any lighting. It’s a great tool for art students or professionals wondering what the skeleton is really doing beneath a life pose, or for anyone wanting to visualize a pose from scratch. The interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use, without sacrificing any of the nuances of the human body’s complex range of movement. Skelly is a big improvement over the old wooden mannikin.\"\n\n- Chris Oatley, Director Of The Oatley Academy Of Visual Storytelling Says:\n\n\"Skelly is the fastest, most fluid anatomical reference I have ever seen. I was shocked at how easy it is to pose the figure and direct the light source. Finally! It’s the app visual artists have been waiting for.\"\n\nHave any questions? CONTACT US:\n\nskelly@proko.com"

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Dette gjør at barna får forståelsen av hvordan lyder blir til ord og setninger, noe som hjelper dem til å knekke lesekoden. \n\nSlik spiller man:\nVed å trykke på figuren, får man høre setningen som skal staves. Man kan også høre bokstavlydene ved å trykke på hver enkel bokstav. Dra så bokstavene i riktig rekkefølge til de tomme linjene under figuren for å stave setningen.\n\nAlle apper fra Bokstavkongen er designet for å fungere på iPhone så vel som på iPader med større skjermer.\n\nIngen reklame eller in-app kjøp!\n\n\n\nBokstavkongen\n\nBokstavkongen tilbyr et stort utvalg av læringsapper for skrive- og leseopplæring. Appene er godt egnet til bruk både hjemme og på skolen, og de er laget i samarbeid med spesialpedagoger og lærere.\n\nBokstavkongen bruker alltid bokstavlyder og ikke bokstavnavn, da det er bokstavlydene som er viktige og brukes når man skal lære seg å lese. Bokstavene representerer lyder man binder sammen til ord når man skal knekke lesekoden.\n\nBokstavkongen-appene fokuserer også på oppgaver, slik at barna får trening i å se ordene som ordbilder. Barna lærer de ordene som ikke er lydrette og er nødt til å gjenkjenne ordet som et bilde.\n\nHar du tilbakemeldinger og ønsker for enkelte av appene eller forslag til nye apper, så hører vi veldig gjerne fra deg!\n\nSend oss gjerne en e-post på post@bokstavkongen.no!\n\nFølg oss på Facebook: http://fb.me/bokstavkongen"

      "label": "Do you want to learn a foreign language quickly? A unique program for memorizing words will help you to do it. \nThe main success of learning a foreign language consists in the most rapid vocabulary replenishment: you should repeat words time and again. For this purpose people often use the notepads, what is not always convenient.\n\nNew app \"My Dictionary: polyglot\" combines several functions and advantages:\n• 90 kinds of dictionaries (English, German, French, Spanish, etc.);\n• 8 types of training: word search, writing the words, searching for a translation, comparison of the studied words and its translation;\n• Automatic translation of an adding word;\n• Evaluation of learning the words;\n• Completely learned words can be hidden or deleted from the main list of study;\n• Short statistics, that shows the dynamics of learning;\n• Pronunciation of a word;\n• Quick search of words and translations in the dictionary;\n• Tags for words, search by tags, training by tags;\n• Transcription for words and usage examples;\n• Image editor for words;\n\nThis app allows you to expand your vocabulary fast enough. Its main advantage is the availability of 8 different trainings for learning. 90 kinds of dictionaries include the most popular world languages, such as English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Portuguese. As a result, it is possible to learn sequentially or simultaneously speaking several languages.\n\nThe app provides a unique opportunity to learn multiple words per day and it is the fastest way to learn the language because vocabulary is the basis of a quick study. The more new words you learn, the better you will understand your interlocutor, and the easier you will communicate with him. Of course, the grammar is also necessary, but we recommend to learn it after learning vocabulary, at least the basic words. Otherwise learning a foreign language will be much harder, longer and more boring.\n\nThis app will be especially useful for those who read foreign literature, visit foreign forums and sites. Finding a new unknown word in the text, the user can simply add it to his dictionary, see the translation, and then learn with the help of training. Usually without a dictionary people forget a new word soon, and seeing it again they have to look for it once more.\n\nDuring the app’s development the complexity of \"manual\" search of translation and the psychological aspects of learning of words, including the lack of free time, were taken into account. So: Having met in the text an unknown word, just go to the app, enter a new word in the dictionary and see the translation. If it’s necessary, add it to the list of studied words. During studying the program shows the level of mastering the words (in percent). When the word is learned, it is enough to tick \"Studied\" on the appropriate word and it ceases to appear in training. Learned words do not appear in the list for training, but remain in the dictionary that allows you to find them quickly when it’s needed. Thus, the application “My Dictionary: polyglot” is an invaluable aid in learning a foreign language.\n\nSupported dictionaries in the application: Russian, English, Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijan, Afrikaans, Basque, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Bosnian, Welsh, Vietnamese, Hungarian, Haitian (Creole), Galician, Dutch, Greek, Georgian, Danish, Yiddish, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Icelandic, Spanish, Kazakh, Catalan, Kyrgyz, Chinese, Korean, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Macedonian, Mongolian, German, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Serbian, Slovakian, Slovenian, Swahili, Tajik, Thai, Tagalog, Tatar, Turkish, Uzbek, Ukrainian, Finish, French, Croatian, Czech, Swedish, Estonian, Japanese."

All the stock images and Smarty Ears symbols are searchable by name.\n\nSet a timer for either an entire schedule or for individual steps within it.\n\nAttach a choice board or video to any step.\n\nThere are FIVE different viewing options: Look at one single image at a time (great for the visually impaired), view two images in a First Then board format, scroll through a checklist, drag and drop an image to another column once a step is complete or drag and drop an image from a strip and put it in an envelope.\n\nFTVS HD makes it easy to create, customize and share schedules.\n\nYou can copy the templates that come with the app or create your own from scratch.\n\nEasily edit, move, delete or hide steps within schedules.\n\nYou can print your schedules and share them with other users via email.

Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more.

Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

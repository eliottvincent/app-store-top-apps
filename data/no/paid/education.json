      "label": "Poio is a phonics and reading game that, in a short time, has helped more than 100,000 children learn how to read. In a study surveying more than 4,000 parents who use Poio with their children, over 85% report a significant positive impact on their child’s literacy learning.\n\n* Covers the first years of learning to read, from matching letters and sounds to reading a complex fairy-tale story with irregular words\n* The app is commonly used in preschools, primary schools, kindergartens and first grade as an introduction to literacy.\n\n“She astounded us with being able to read the story”\n— Grandmother to Ann (3)\n\n«With Poio, my sons now nag to practise reading» \n— dad to Noah (4) and James (6). \n\n«Unlike other apps we had used before, Poio showed the user letter and sounds in a wide variety of different formats – as letters, words and in sentences and within multiple different scenarios in the game.»\n— Victoria Galligan, QA Education Magazine\n\n\nTHE POIO METHOD\nPoio is a unique approach to phonics teaching, where children are in charge of their own learning journey.\n\n1. Poio is a game designed to engage your child through play and ignite their curiosity for reading.\n2. The game continuously adapts to each child's level of skill, providing a sense of mastery and keeping the child motivated.\n3. Keep track of your child’s achievements with our email reports, and get advice on how to initiate a positive dialogue to reinforce learning.\n4. The goal is for your child to read the story book to you, their siblings or impressed grandparents.\n\nEXPLORATION SPARKS CURIOSITY FOR THE STORY BOOK\nThe story takes place on a magical island, inhabited by a group of letter bugs called Readlings. Your child will help a troll, named Poio, learn how to read the storybook he has stolen from the Readlings. \n\nThese cute characters introduce letters, words and the story in a coherent fantasy world that unravels scene-by-scene. The game is full of tasks of increasing complexity, which helps the child to practice letter shapes, spell words and improve their phonetic awareness. Ultimately your child will make friends with all the Readlings and read the story book for the troll; and then for you, younger siblings or impressed grandparents.\n\n\nTHE GAME ELEMENTS\n\n#1 THE FAIRY TALE BOOK\nInside the game there is a book. It’s empty when your child starts playing. However, as the game unfolds, it will fill up with words and unravel the mysteries of the fantasy world.\n\n#2 THE READLINGS\nReadlings are cute bugs who eat alphabet letters. They are very picky about what they like, and have different personalities. The child controls them all!\n\n#3 A TROLL\nPoio, the main character of the game, catches the cute Readlings. He needs their help to read the book he has stolen from them. As they collected words at each level, children will spell them out in order to read the book.\n\n#4 STRAW ISLAND\nThe troll and the Readlings live on an island, in the forest, a desert valley and a winter land. The goal of each straw-level is to eat as many vowels as possible and find a new word for the book. A sub goal is to rescue all the trapped Readlings. To unlock the cages where the Readings are trapped, we give children phonic tasks to practice letter sounds and spelling.\n\n#5 HOUSES\nFor every Reading they rescue, children are rewarded with the opportunity to enter a special “house”. This gives them a break from the intense phonetics training. Here, they can use the gold coins they collect to furnish and decorate the house, while playing with the subjects and verbs of everyday objects.\n\n#6 COLLECTABLE CARDS\nThe cards encourage children to find new things and to practice more. The board of cards also serves as a playful instruction menu for the elements in the game.\n\n---\n\nTHE INVENTOR\nPoio is made by a father, teacher and tech-expert who quit his job to find a better way for children to crack the reading code. Our goal is to empower children all around the world to learn to read through play."

Here you train yourself in recognizing other people's behaviour patterns, which will be of great benefit in all future meetings. For example, how do you meet an introvert if you are an extrovert yourself? In what way can you separate factual issues from personal ones? How do you adapt more quickly to people around you and get what you want? You find the answers here. With the help of Surrounded by idiots, all interaction with others becomes both smoother and easier.\n\nThe app contains many areas of knowledge about different behaviours. You regularly test your skills through different types of quizzes and through concrete problem solving of different relationship challenges. In just a few minutes you can also do a simplified behavioural analysis of both yourself and others. Then you receive a recommendation on which strategy you should use towards different individuals. It cannot be more simple!\n\nThe content is easily accessible and entertaining, at the same time as you build real skills around how to handle everyone you meet from now on.\n\nSurrounded by idiots is for both you who are interested in yourself and your own personal development, and for you who are curious about how other people work - and why. Have you ever had trouble understanding people around you? Are you tired of poor communication and misunderstandings? Are you looking for tools to easier get along with others? Then this is the app for you.\n\nThe biggest benefit is that from day one you will increase your social skills. You will understand people around you in a completely different way. Your various interactions with people you meet will be seen in a whole new light. The amount of unnecessary conflicts will decrease, and you will more easily understand both your partner and – why not your boss. And, not least, they will understand you.\n\nThe app costs no more than a lunch but contains insights you will benefit from for years.\nIt is based on the best-selling book Surrounded by Idiots. And builds on the worldwide model with the four colours: red, yellow, green and blue. The fundamentals can be traced all the way back to Carl Jung."

      "label": "Play with letters, sounds and words together with Alfie Atkins. Children love learning new things through play. This app, Play ABC, Alfie Atkins, stimulates children's language learning skills by clearly connecting the function and purpose of letters in an experimental, playful way.\n\nAlfie has some extraordinary devices in his room: a letter tracer, a word machine and a puppet theatre. With the letter tracer, children will learn the appearance and sound of all letters and train their motor skills and muscle memory by drawing and tracing letters on the screen. Using Alfie's homemade word machine, children will spell new words using phonemes and letter tips. All new words are sent to the puppet theatre, where children use their creativity and imagination to tell fantastic stories. This playloop, with concrete results, has a motivational effect and helps children develop their language skills at their own pace.\n\nPlay ABC, Alfie Atkins is developed by language teachers and game designers. It was created and tested in collaboration with teachers and students of schools in Finland and Sweden. The app has been developed based on children's needs and does not feature points, time limits or other elements that could lead to failure or stress. Children will play and learn using the app on their own terms and at their own pace, in preschool, at school or at home.\n\nPlay and learn:\n  • The sounds, phonemes and names of letters\n  • How to trace letters\n  • How to spell around 100 different words\n  • How to read simple words\n  • Upper and lowercase letters\n  • Fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination\n  • The basics of literacy\n  • Creative storytelling\n\nThe app is available in 6 different languages, and the full version allows the creation of individual profiles for multiple children.\n\nThis is the premium, full, version of the app which enables:\n  • Preschools, schools and organisations can purchase the app through the volume purchase program (VPP)\n  • Family sharing is supported\n\nGro Play is an xEdu.co alumnus and member of the trade organization Swedish EdTech Industry.

Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

Stabler du flere ord, venter det en glitrende skatt i belønning!\n\nLydene gjentas når man staver ordene slik at barna oppdager hvordan lyder settes sammen til ord og på den måten enkelt knekker lesekoden.

Vi spesialiserer oss på apper for barn, gjerne med en pedagogisk vri. Målet er å skape læring gjennom kreativ atspredelse - digitale leketøy som skal invitere både barna og foreldrene til å leke sammen. Boggatap fokuserer på trygg og inpsirerende lek og har derfor verken tredjeparts reklame eller \"kjøp i app\"-ordninger. Vi samler heller ikke inn noe personlig data fra brukeren. De eneste lenkene til internet finner inne i \"foreldre-sonen\" som er sikret med en \"foreldre-lås\", altså utenfor barnas umiddelbare rekkevidde. Boggataps apper er med i \"KNOW what's inside\" - et program skapt av MOMs with apps og ACT som er en redaksjon av foreldre og pedagoger som leter etter trygge apper for barn, fri for reklame."

      "label": "Et morsomt og lærerikt spill som gir barna motivasjon og mestring i den første lese- og skriveopplæringen. Spillet består av tre deler, som er en kombinasjon mellom arbeidsminnetrening, sporing av bokstaver og lekeverden. Når barna sporer eller skriver bokstavene lærer man samtidig å knytte bokstavlyden til både liten og stor bokstav. Å lære bokstavlydene er viktig for å knekke lesekoden.\n\nEtter som barna mestrer flere og flere bokstaver blir man belønnet med penger som man kan bruke til kjøp i butikken. I butikken kan man kjøpe ulike objekter som kan plasseres ut i en lekeverden. Her kan det åpnes for eventyrlige samtaler om hva man ser og hva som skjer. Det er også gode muligheter for språktrening, som for eksempel å øve på preposisjoner.\n\nSpillet er lett og intuitivt. Det er utviklet av pedagogisk-psykologisk rådgiver (PPT) i samarbeid med barn og unge. Og er også tilpasset i samarbeid med barn som har lese- og skrivevansker, samt konsentrasjon- og oppmerksomhetsvansker.\n\nI menyvalget kan man velge å øve på bokstavene i vanlig alfabetisk rekkefølge eller i silorema-rekkefølge. Silorema-rekkefølgen er ofte den progresjonen som brukes i den første bokstavinnlæringen på skolen. \n\nEgenskaper:\n- Spillbasert læring som styrker arbeidsminnet\n- Mengdetrening av alle bokstavene i alfabetet\n- Lekpreget og motiverende\n- Selvstendig læring\n- Ingen reklame i app\n- Ingen kjøp i app"

Skriver du feil 5 ganger så må du skrive dem riktig 5 ganger! \nFeil-lista kjøres altså helt til du KAN glosene!\n\nDel med andre:\nDu kan dele gloseprøvene dine med andre via SMS og ePost eller få dem tilsendt fra din lærer.  \nLÆRERE:  Klasseprøver i iPad-klasser!  Se NYHET lenger nede på siden!\n\nMålgruppe: \nVanlig språkutdannelse: engelsk, norsk, tysk, spansk osv.\nHelsepersonell kan pugge faguttrykk osv.\n \nHva kan gjøres:\n-Bruke de innlagte eksempel-glosene.\n-Legge inn nye gloser eller setninger.\n-Snu glosene om fra f.eks ”Norsk-Engelsk” til ”Engelsk-Norsk”\n-Slå sammen alle gloseprøvene du har hatt til en hovedprøve.\n-Eksportere gloser til andre f.eks via SMS, ePost, hjemmesiden, Showbie mm.\n-Importere gloser fra andre f.eks via SMS, ePost, hjemmesiden, Showbie mm.\n-Oppslag mot G-Translate\n-Egen WEB-side hvor flere innsendte gloser vil bli lagt ut . Her finner du også hjelp.\n\nNYHET:  Klasseprøver!\nLærerne kan nå kjøre gloseprøver i iPad-klasser!\nLærerne sender ut en gloseprøve i kodet format (uleselig!) via ePost eller Showbie, elevene importerer prøven til Gloseprøven som automatisk starter og elevene besvarer. Mens besvaringen pågår er iPad-en låst til Gloseprøven så ingen kan jukse!\nStraks prøven er ferdig vil den bli sendt til lærerens epost i både kodet og ukodet format for at lærer enkelt skal kunne se besvarelsene. \nKodet og ukodet del skal ha samme innhold så det er enkelt å avsløre forsøk på triksing med resultatene i mailen!\nAlle avvik logges!\n\nOppfølgingsverktøy:\nEt eget gratis oppfølgingsverktøy henter alle innsendte besvarelsene opp i Excel og setter karakterer på hver elev (lærer kan overstyre karaktersettingen).\nEt nytt ark genereres for hver prøve slik at lærer har en Excel-fil med alle prøvene samlet; noe som gir god oversikt!\nLærerne slipper å lage papirutgaver som må rettes, men får nå automatisk alle prøver tilsendt på ePost, karaktersatt og lagret i et Excel regneark. \n\nElevenes fordel etter innsendt prøve: \nStraks prøven er sendt til læreren, får eleven se feilene i Feil-lista og kan jobbe med glosene til Feil-lista er tom; altså til elevene kan alle glosene i gloseprøven. Genialt!\n\n- Oppfølgingsverktøyet får du gratis tilsendt ved å sende en ePost til gloseproven@gmail.com. \n\n- En enkel fusk-kontroll-app (dersom noen justerer på ePosten), GloseFusk, er også klar for nedlastning.\n\nLykke til med nye språk!\n\n- Programmet krever minst iPhone 4 eller iPad med minst IOS 7"

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Appene er godt egnet til bruk både hjemme og på skolen, og de er laget i samarbeid med spesialpedagoger og lærere.\n\nBokstavkongen bruker alltid bokstavlyder og ikke bokstavnavn, da det er bokstavlydene som er viktige og brukes når man skal lære seg å lese. Bokstavene representerer lyder man binder sammen til ord når man skal knekke lesekoden.\n\nBokstavkongen-appene fokuserer også på oppgaver, slik at barna får trening i å se ordene som ordbilder. Barna lærer de ordene som ikke er lydrette og er nødt til å gjenkjenne ordet som et bilde.\n\nHar du tilbakemeldinger og ønsker for enkelte av appene eller forslag til nye apper, så hører vi veldig gjerne fra deg!\n\nSend oss gjerne en e-post på post@bokstavkongen.no!\n\nFølg oss på Facebook: http://fb.me/bokstavkongen"

We want to give them the opportunity to make these stories into little radio drama adventures that they can edit and listen to alone or with their friends. \n\nTheir own voice, sounds or music can be recorded with a microphone and they can browse through the sound library looking for suitable sounds. There are different soundtracks that are placed over each other and can be shifted. The individual sound sequences can be cut and moved. Operation is very simple and intuitive. \n\nHIGHLIGHTS: \n– Easy and child-friendly use \n– Large sound library \n– Promotes speech and listening skills \n– No internet or WLAN needed \n– No in-app purchases \n\nDISCOVER AND LEARN: \nWith our \"Audio Adventure\" app children can take a trip through the world of sounds. What sounds are around us? What does a rain storm sound like? And: how do sounds change when I record them? This is a playful way to promote speech and listening skills – an important precondition for learning speaking, reading and writing.\n\nDOING SOMETHING NICE FOR OTHERS  \nYour own radio plays and podcasts can be easily stored and sent to grandma and grandpa or friends.\n\nINCLUDED IN THE NEXT UPDATE: fading in an out of soundtracks and fun effects for the voice recordings.\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn’t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

Vi spesialiserer oss på apper for barn, gjerne med en pedagogisk vri. Målet er å skape læring gjennom kreativ atspredelse - digitale leketøy som skal invitere både barna og foreldrene til å leke sammen. Boggatap fokuserer på trygg og inpirerende lek og har derfor verken tredjeparts reklame eller \"kjøp i app\"-ordninger. Vi samler heller ikke inn noe personlig data fra brukeren. De eneste lenkene til internet finner inne i \"foreldre-sonen\" som er sikret med en \"foreldre-lås\", altså utenfor barnas umiddelbare rekkevidde. Boggataps apper er med i \"KNOW what's inside\" - et program skapt av MOMs with apps og ACT som er en redaksjon av foreldre og pedagoger som leter etter trygge apper for barn, fri for reklame."

Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug!

Prof. of Religion, Fairfield University\n\n                              _____________________\n\nTheologica is the simple, yet comprehensive theological study app for the iPhone. Drawing from the rich treasures of the intellectual tradition of the Church, from the 1st to the 21st century, this app is designed to be an essential study tool for both students and teachers of theology as well as for anyone who desires to “think faith”. \n\nTheologica features 5 tabs: Overview, Reference, Dictionary, Maps, and Explorations, which enable its users to enhance their knowledge of theology in multiple contexts.\n\nOverview\n\nThe Overview tab presents a wide-angle view of theology as a dialectical enterprise that continuously seeks to better understand the Faith of the Church in a given historical situation. To fulfill that vocation, theology draws on various sources in order to faithfully interpret the signs of the times. The primary sources are: Magisterium, Sacred Scripture, Church Fathers, Ecumenical Councils, Creeds, and Liturgy. All of these sources, though distinct, are organically related to the life of the Church. Theology is always practiced in a particular historical and cultural context. Thus, cultural trends and indicators of the worldview of modern men and women necessarily affect the way in which the Faith of the Church is understood. It is therefore vital for theology to pay attention to these signs in order to fulfill its vocation. They include: Philosophy, Science, Technology, Politics, Economics, and the Arts. While not exhaustive, these aspects of life in the 21st century are the primary factors which affect the thinking of people everywhere.\n\nReference\n\nThe Reference tab features a curated list of live links for each category in the Overview tab along with those sites that feature theology in action. Most of these sites contain significant documents which are referenced in the Dictionary.\n\nDictionary\n\nThe Dictionary tab includes a list of over 500 of the most commonly used theological terms in both high school and college classrooms, grouped by the categories: Systematic, Historical, Moral, Biblical, Liturgical, and Cultural.  Terms can be bookmarked for quick access when used for exam preparation. Definitions contain extensive links to curated resources for further reference, publicly available online. \n\nMaps\n\nThe Maps tab includes over 40 custom pin locations grouped by the categories: Old Testament, New Testament, Church History, and Social Justice. Each location includes a detail page with additional information on the given site as well as links for more information. Theology is practiced in ancient, historical, and modern geographical contexts, and this is clearly expressed in Maps.\n\nExplorations\n\nThe Explorations tab features in-depth analysis of specific questions in theology, which are generated by the dialectic it has with modern culture. This tab also includes periodic interviews with contemporary theologians and other cultural influencers who are actively engaged in shaping the various contexts of theology. This tab features various such explorations on a regular basis.\n\nTheologica began as an idea for an iPhone app that could serve as a comprehensive study aid for students as well as an instructional tool for teachers. It is and will remain ad-free with no additional fees for future updates."

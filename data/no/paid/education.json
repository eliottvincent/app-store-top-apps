      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Poio is a phonics and reading game that, in a short time, has helped more than 100,000 children learn how to read. In a study surveying more than 4,000 parents who use Poio with their children, over 85% report a significant positive impact on their child’s literacy learning.\n\n* Covers the first years of learning to read, from matching letters and sounds to reading a complex fairy-tale story with irregular words\n* The app is commonly used in preschools, primary schools, kindergartens and first grade as an introduction to literacy.\n\n“She astounded us with being able to read the story”\n— Grandmother to Ann (3)\n\n«With Poio, my sons now nag to practise reading» \n— dad to Noah (4) and James (6). \n\n«Unlike other apps we had used before, Poio showed the user letter and sounds in a wide variety of different formats – as letters, words and in sentences and within multiple different scenarios in the game.»\n— Victoria Galligan, QA Education Magazine\n\n\nTHE POIO METHOD\nPoio is a unique approach to phonics teaching, where children are in charge of their own learning journey.\n\n1. Poio is a game designed to engage your child through play and ignite their curiosity for reading.\n2. The game continuously adapts to each child's level of skill, providing a sense of mastery and keeping the child motivated.\n3. Keep track of your child’s achievements with our email reports, and get advice on how to initiate a positive dialogue to reinforce learning.\n4. The goal is for your child to read the story book to you, their siblings or impressed grandparents.\n\nEXPLORATION SPARKS CURIOSITY FOR THE STORY BOOK\nThe story takes place on a magical island, inhabited by a group of letter bugs called Readlings. Your child will help a troll, named Poio, learn how to read the storybook he has stolen from the Readlings. \n\nThese cute characters introduce letters, words and the story in a coherent fantasy world that unravels scene-by-scene. The game is full of tasks of increasing complexity, which helps the child to practice letter shapes, spell words and improve their phonetic awareness. Ultimately your child will make friends with all the Readlings and read the story book for the troll; and then for you, younger siblings or impressed grandparents.\n\n\nTHE GAME ELEMENTS\n\n#1 THE FAIRY TALE BOOK\nInside the game there is a book. It’s empty when your child starts playing. However, as the game unfolds, it will fill up with words and unravel the mysteries of the fantasy world.\n\n#2 THE READLINGS\nReadlings are cute bugs who eat alphabet letters. They are very picky about what they like, and have different personalities. The child controls them all!\n\n#3 A TROLL\nPoio, the main character of the game, catches the cute Readlings. He needs their help to read the book he has stolen from them. As they collected words at each level, children will spell them out in order to read the book.\n\n#4 STRAW ISLAND\nThe troll and the Readlings live on an island, in the forest, a desert valley and a winter land. The goal of each straw-level is to eat as many vowels as possible and find a new word for the book. A sub goal is to rescue all the trapped Readlings. To unlock the cages where the Readings are trapped, we give children phonic tasks to practice letter sounds and spelling.\n\n#5 HOUSES\nFor every Reading they rescue, children are rewarded with the opportunity to enter a special “house”. This gives them a break from the intense phonetics training. Here, they can use the gold coins they collect to furnish and decorate the house, while playing with the subjects and verbs of everyday objects.\n\n#6 COLLECTABLE CARDS\nThe cards encourage children to find new things and to practice more. The board of cards also serves as a playful instruction menu for the elements in the game.\n\n---\n\nTHE INVENTOR\nPoio is made by a father, teacher and tech-expert who quit his job to find a better way for children to crack the reading code. Our goal is to empower children all around the world to learn to read through play."

Can you tell the difference between excitement and fear, or between aggression and the need to play?\r\n\r\nDog language can be confusing, but with the help of Dog Decoder, you’ll understand your dog’s signals like a pro.\r\n\r\nDog Decoder will teach you everything you need to know about how your dog communicates, so you can not only avoid bites, but share in a more satisfying, healthy, and loving relationship.\r\n\r\n=== MEET “DIAMOND” === \r\n\r\nDiamond is your tour guide and trainer. He will show you how he looks when he’s afraid, when he’s stressed, when he’s just about to bite, and when he wants to play. \r\n\r\n=== DOG POSTURES ===\r\n\r\nThere are about SIXTY different poses on display in Dog Decoder. Each pose is beautifully and expressively illustrated by one of the world’s top dog artists.\r\n\r\nEach pose comes with a diagram, pointing out where on Diamond’s body he’s indicating how he’s feeling. For example, in the poses for “fear,” the diagram will point out Diamond’s tucked tail, his ears pulled back, etc. We won’t just show you a picture of a scared dog — we’ll teach you what to look for, the signs of fear.\r\n\r\nEach pose also comes with a helpful description of the context. This is where you will learn about some common misconceptions, or what kinds of situations will cause your dog to assume each posture.\r\n\r\n=== TEST YOURSELF! ===\r\n\r\nThe best way to see how much you’ve learned is to take the quiz! Some of the quiz questions are pretty challenging. Diamond wants to make sure you don’t get fooled next time he’s hiding under the coffee table or drooling – will you recognize the early warning signs of stress? Will you be able to warn your children when your dog is clearly done playing?"

      "label": "Begynn leseopplæringen gjennom dette morsomme spillet. Lær bokstaver, bokstavlyder og ord. Øv hjernen på å lære. Spillet brukes i norsk skole.\n \nDragon Minders er et spill som både trener barnets evne til å lære og tilbyr grunnleggende lesetrening. Spillet er tilpasset barn mellom 4-7 år, og samsvarer godt med læringsmål i norskfaget som barna møter 1. og 2. skoleår. \n\nDragon Minders passer også godt til barn som sliter med å lære seg og lese.\n \nDragon Minders er et spill som lærer barna alfabetets 29 bokstaver samt alle bokstavenes egne lyder (fonemer). Dette er svært viktig for å kunne knekke lesekoden. Når barnet er klar for det, kan ordtreningen starte. Ordene i spillet er valgt på bakgrunn av spesialpedagogers og læreres ønsker, og mange av dem er såkalte høyfrekvente ord. Altså ord som forekommer ofte i setninger og tekst. Ved å kunne lese og gjenkjenne disse ordene vil lesehastigheten øke og leseforståelse kan oppnås raskere og bedre. Bokstav- og ordtreningen finnes i den ene av totalt tre aktivitetsområder i Dragon Minders-verdenen. Antall bokstaver og ord i gitt rekkefølge vil øke i takt med barnets progresjon, og gi viktig arbeidsminnetrening samtidig med mengdetrening i bokstav- og ordlæring. \n \nIldtempelet består av et hjul med flammer i tre ulike farger. Barnets oppgave blir å huske hvilke flammefarger som beskrives med deres engelske fargenavn i riktig rekkefølge. Med andre ord så trenes det på uttalen på engelske fargenavn, samtidig som en skal huske rekkefølgen på dem. Sistnevnte er arbeidsminnetrening. Antallet flammer øker etter hvert som barnet husker riktig rekkefølge på dem. Mengden vil justeres automatisk etter hvor mye barnet husker, og dermed kontinuerlig gi barnet noe å strekke seg etter.\n\nEntene som vi finner i det tredje aktivitetsområdet, er små trær som står på rekker. Her er det ren arbeidsminnetrening, hvor oppgaven blir å huske rekkefølgen på hvilke trær som beveger seg når. Det starter med få trær, men antallet justeres opp (eller ned) etter hva barnet klarer å huske. Målet er å være i yttergrensen for hvor mye arbeidsminnet klarer, for på den måten å forbedre kapasiteten samt gi barnet noe å strekke seg etter. \n\nLike egenskaper for alle tre aktivitetene er at barnet får belønninger ut i fra oppnådd resultat. Belønningene er ulike matsorter som dragen trenger for å vokse seg stor og sterk. Etter hver aktivitet kan barnet gå i dragetempelet og gi dragen sin mat, samt kose med den og høre koselydene den lager. \n\nDragon Minders er laget i samarbeid med barn, der barna selv har valgt de ulike figurene. Gjennom spillet vil barnets egen drage bli klekket og vokser i takt med utviklingen barnet har i spillet. Det er også en fonetisk test som viser hvor mange bokstaver og bokstavlyder barnet kan. Den er anbefalt å gjøre ved første gangs bruk og etter tre-fire uker.\n \nEgenskaper:\n* Innovativ læring gjennom utforsking og lek\n* Underholdende\n* Mengdetrening på store og små bokstaver\n* Inneholder alle 29 bokstavene i norske alfabetet\n* Bokstavlyder for alle bokstavene\n* Høyfrekvente ord som er viktig å lære for å knekke lesekoden\n* Dysleksivennlige bokstaver\n* Engelske begreper slik som farger\n* Arbeidsminnetrening som øker konsentrasjon, korttidshukommelse og evnen til å gjenbruke kunnskap\n* Trening av arbeidsminne anbefales spesielt til barn med ADHD, dysleksi, generelle lærevansker, samt fortidligfødte\n* Umiddelbar tilbakemelding underveis i spillet på fremgangen\n* Din egen drage som vokser i takt med at kunnskapen øker\n* Fonetisk test som måler kunnskapsnivå på hvor mange bokstaver og bokstavlyder barnet kan\n* Ingen reklame i app\n* Ingen kjøp i app"

Pets can play outdoors or wait on the cozy beds until the vet is ready to see them.\n\nPET SHOP: Find everything you need for to groom, feed, play with and care for your pets at the pet shop. After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice and your characters’ movements as you’re telling the story. Create videos up to two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share your storytelling later! \n\nAbout Us:\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "MONAD does something that no other clock or calendar does; it tells the planetary time and date – the solar day, lunar month & seasonal year.  MONAD reveals your unique place (and perspective) in planet-centered space and time.  MONAD demonstrates the biorhythms of the Earth’s biosphere, and it integrates two types of time: 1) Natural time, which is cyclic, variable, and alive, with 2) Mechanical time, which is linear, highly regular, abstract and artificial. MONAD represents a paradigm shift of planetary proportions; A New Paradigm of Time\n\nWith MONAD, you see the natural rhythms of time­ proceeding in endless circles and spirals.  MONAD shows the location of the stars and planets; what’s visible at night from your location on Earth.  MONAD shows the progression of the four seasons and the phases of the Moon; the obliquity of the ecliptic and the Earth’s circle of illumination, and a Twilight Dial tells you the time of Sun rise and Sun set at any latitude and time of year.  MONAD shows the agricultural biorhythms of the Earth’s photosynthetic biosphere.  MONAD restores the Earth, and the Earth’s biorhythms and biosphere, back to the center of our collective attention and awareness.\n\nWith MONAD you see the Earth globe from an unusual perspective; the north (or south) polar axial perspective.  MONAD automatically places a time zone-spanning Hour Hand at your location on the globe, marking your longitude & latitude, and you see all 24 time zones, all around the globe at the same time, the whole world interconnected.\n\nMONAD has four main Modes of operation.  Geocentric (Geo) Mode features planet Earth at the center of a time and date-telling, 3-dimensional celestial ring.  The algorithms and programming which drive all of the astronomical activity is based on a Sun-centered and highly accurate model of the solar system which you can access in Heliocentric (Helio) Mode.  Accelerate through time, into the past or future, and watch how the configuration of the solar system changes.  Shift back and forth from Geo to Helio Modes, and it’s easy to see how the two perspectives are related.  It’s easy to see how and why the planets have apparent retrograde activity from an Earth-centered perspective. There is so much to explore and learn in MONAD.\n\nAstro Mode features a 2-dimensional Calendar-Clock face, which makes it possible to set the time by dragging the hour hand around the dial, or you can set the date by dragging the calendar band, or zodiac band, past the Sun’s meridian or date indicator fixed at noon at the top of the dial.  A Table at the top of the screen lists the precise location of the Sun, Moon and planets at any time and date, so basically this Astro screen is equivalent to an astronomy or astrology chart, at any moment in time. Astro Mode will eventually feature a Scientific Astrology Program and an Educational Astronomy Program.\n\nEvent Mode is where you record and schedule personal events, in the context of important and memorable planetary events we all share.  Color-coded Event Wedges are shown in the context of the 4 corners of a solar day (Sun rise, noon, Sun set & midnight), the 4 corners of a lunar month (full and dark Moon, waxing and waning half Moons), and the 4 corners of a seasonal year  (equinoxes & solstices).  Another unique feature of MONAD is that you can record events “in the Now,” which encourages more presence in your life.  \n\nA Health Event Mode allows you to see your personal, endocrine biorhythms in the context of planetary biorhythms we all share.  The 24 hour circadian Calendar-Clock face is ideally suited to organize and display health events.  If you choose to have MONAD integrate with the Apple Health app (HealthKit); then health data (e.g. Sleep period and Steps) read from HealthKit is used for display within the MONAD app.\n\nMONAD is beautiful, educational & transformative, and it will change the way you see the world around you, and your place within it.  MONAD – A New Paradigm of Time."

Boggatap fokuserer på trygg og inspirerende lek og har derfor verken tredjeparts reklame eller \"kjøp i app\"-ordninger. Vi samler heller ikke inn noe personlig data fra brukeren. De eneste lenkene til internet finner inne i \"foreldre-sonen\" som er sikret med en \"foreldre-lås\", altså utenfor barnas umiddelbare rekkevidde. Boggataps apper er med i \"KNOW what's inside\" - et program skapt av MOMs with apps og ACT som er en redaksjon av foreldre og pedagoger som leter etter trygge apper for barn, fri for reklame."

      "label": "The purpose of Crack the Reading Code is to teach what is practical for reading: \n- Shape\n- Writing direction\n- Sound. \n\nThese are the foundations of reading. \n\nChildren can acquire the essential knowledge that letters represent sounds, fit together and makes words that have meaning.\n \nThe content has been developed by experienced teachers - A supplement to writing textbooks and reading education\n\nChildren in kindergarten who are curious about letters will also think it's exciting. \n\n* THE SOUND OF THE LETTERS BEFORE THE NAMES.\n\nCrack the Reading Code uses exclusively letter sounds. \n\nChildren often learn the names of the letters instead of the sound of the letters. This means that they must apprehend something that they cannot use for their further reading. Often, they will have to relearn it when they are shown sounds at school that they have to use to read. \n\nBroadly speaking, they have no use for the letter names in the initial stages of reading. \n\n* THE 120 MOST USED WORDS AS WORD PICTURES.\n\nMany of the 120 most used words are not spelled as they sound. Therefore, it is a big help to recognize these as word pictures. \n\nChildren won't be forced to sound it out here, but instead just recognize the word like they recognize their own name or that a big yellow M means McDonald's. \n\nThat is why these 120 are trained as word pictures in Crack the Reading Code.\n\nUppercase letters for the intermediate learner.\n\nMany children first learn the 'big letters'. Of course, these must also be learned, but it should happen only when the child already recognizes the 'small letters.'\n\nIt is easier to relate to one shape per sound than two. \n\nWhen they have learned the lowercase letters, they can already recognize the letters in the books they must read. \n\nSwitching between the 'lowercase' and 'uppercase' in 'Settings.'\n\nSettings:\n\n-\tTurn the music in the menus on/off\n-\tHide the text direction. Hiding the text direction increases the level of difficulty.\n-\tSwitch between uppercase and lowercase letters. \n\nWe recommend that you only change to 'big letters' when the 'small letters' have been successfully learned.\n\nTarget audience:\n4 - 10 years (those who can't read or have a hard time doing so)."

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Ved å lytte til alle bokstavlydene og dra den korrekte på plass, får man god trening i å koble bokstavlydene sammen med bokstavene.\n\nBokstavkongen\nBokstavkongen tilbyr et stort utvalg av læringsapper for skrive- og leseopplæring. Appene er godt egnet til bruk både hjemme og på skolen, og de er laget i samarbeid med spesialpedagoger og lærere.\n\nBokstavkongen bruker alltid bokstavlyder og ikke bokstavnavn, da det er bokstavlydene som er vikte og brukes når man skal lære seg å lese. Bokstavene representerer lyder man binder sammen til ord når man skal knekke lesekoden.\n\nBokstavkongen-appene fokuserer også på oppgaver, slik at barna får trening i å se ordene som ordbilder. Barna lærer de ordene som ikke er lydrette og er nødt til å gjenkjenne ordet som et bilde.\n\nHar du tilbakemeldinger og ønsker for enkelte av appene eller forslag til nye apper, så hører vi veldig gjerne fra deg!\n\nSend oss gjerne en e-post på post@bokstavkongen.no!\n\nFølg oss på Facebook: http://fb.me/bokstavkongen"

      "label": "We received the \"Editor´s Choice\" award by Apple for \"Little Fox Animal Doctor\" And in addition our app was awarded the \"Tech with Kids' Best Pick Award\" for exceptional design of a children's app. \n\nLittle Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4. Little Fox Animal Doctor is the first 3D-App by Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger. She is also the creative genius behind Nighty Night, Little Fox Music Box and Nighty Night Circus. Her Apps have been downloaded over 5 million times worldwide.                                                                                                                                  \n\nThe App will make your children’s dreams of being an Animal Doctor come true!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years.

      "label": "***** 5/5 stars  EducationalAppStore.com *****\nLetraKid is an educational game addressed to children (4-8 years old) that can help them to learn pre-cursive and print block handwriting correctly, while having fun when doing so!\n\nWHAT KIDS CAN LEARN FROM THIS GAME\n\n• Recognize letter shapes and perfect alphabet pronunciation\n• The correct letter formation: start, checkpoints, strokes direction, order etc. Difficulty Levels 1 and 2 with assisted writing are designed to focus on the letter formation.\n• Develop fine motor skills for handwriting activity. Difficulty Levels 3 to 5 with freehand writing activities will focus on this improvement to help maximize confidence and form when writing.\n• Playing with a stylus pen will also help to improve standard pencil grasp. Any stylus compatible with the device will work.\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n• 16 languages with full support for interface, human native voices for letter/numbers pronunciation and full official alphabets. (ENGLISH, ESPAÑOL, FRANÇAIS, DEUTSCH, ITALIANO, PORTUGUÊS, NEDERLANDS, SVENSKA, NORSK, DANSK, SUOMI, ROMÂNĂ, JĘZYK POLSKI, TÜRKÇE, BAHASA INDONESIA and BAHASA MELAYU)\n• 3 popular letter formation rules that will provide flexibility for picking the right stroke order and direction for the child. Vital for improving grasp on key terms and rulings within handwriting.\n• Makes use of the 10 most used fonts in classes all over the world for learning pre cursive and print block handwriting: ZB style, HWT style, DN style, German(Hamburg) style and Euro Latino.\n• Full support for both Left and Right handwriting rules.\n• 5 difficulty levels with AUTO and LOCK settings, ranging from assisted writing for beginners, up to real freehand writing with minimal support and strict evaluation.\n• 4 set of glyphs: ABC (full alphabet for upper case letters), abc (full alphabet for lower case letters), 123 (numbers from 0 to 9) and a special set of signs for funny exercises.\n• 5 progression levels, color coded for each glyph that allows parents and teachers an instant evaluation of the progression and most exercised letters at the alphabet level.\n• 16 funny sticker rewards that will unlock after progression milestones are reached. Also, their drawing rules after each completed progression at Alphabet/glyph list level.\n• 3 profile slots with 50 funny avatars and name customization that will save independently the settings and the progression.\n• Full support for both Landscape and Portrait orientations.\n\nGREAT IN THE CLASSROOM!\n\nWith a unique and real-time feedback feature as well as complex tracing evaluation algorithms, LetraKid is not just another tracing app.\n\nThis is a new approach, focused on creating a fun game by utilizing handwriting mechanics itself. This avoids using distracting random rewards or secondary game mechanics that can break and confuse the learning process, optimizing learning progress and educational appeal to children.\n\nThe real time feedback will give both audio and graphic clues about the quality of the tracing and will adjust with difficulty level.\nOur tracing evaluation algorithms allow for an accurate and fun reward, using a 5 star rating for each exercise. This engages and motivates the kids to progress and to strive for more.\n\nDESIGNED for KIDS\n\n• No ads or irritating pop-ups.\n• No collection of personal data\n• Game settings are by default behind a parental gate. This can be disabled, but ensures a child to work with a certain font, formation rule, difficulty level and various other features for total specification to their needs.\n• External links are protected by a permanent parental gate and includes upgrade to full version, feedback and social media usage to help follow the latest news and changes with regards to the platform.\n\nGot any ideas for improving LetraKid? Then please send us your feedback and requests."

Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

Hensikten er å å gi struktur og oversikt for å motvirke det sosiale kaoset mange i denne gruppen opplever. Systemet forklarer og systematiserer regler som gjelder for sosialt samspill gjennom å definere ulike sosiale arenaer eller sirkler, tydeliggjøre hvilke krav som gjelder for den aktuelle sirkelen og vise hvordan kravene endrer seg fra den innerste og mest private til den ytterste, mest offentlige sirkelen. \n\nTil hver sirkel lages ulike former for støtteverktøy, i form av f.eks avtaler, sosiale historier og stressmestringsstrategier.\n\nSystemet Mine sirkler har dermed dobbel funksjon:\n1. Forklare og gi oversikt\n2. Gi praktiske løsninger, handlingsaternativ og strategier\n\nMålet er at” Mine sirkler” skal bidra til økt selvstendighet og kontroll over eget liv. Ved at at brukeren får en bedre forståelse av sosiale sammenhenger og til enhver tid har tilgang på løsninger og strategier, vil systemet bidra til bedre mestring og reduksjon av uro, angst og stress.\n\nInnholdet i \" mine sirkler\" må tilpasses den enkelte bruker og er lett å skreddersy. Når applikasjonen er lastet ned vil en få tilgang til en webside der metodikken er beskrevet og der en får eksempler på hva som kan skrives i de enkelte nivå i hver sirkel. Praktisk beskrivelse om hvordan man fyller innhold i de ulike sirklene vil også ligge på websiden."

Choose your most trusted horse and head off for an adventure in the woods, where you can sleep under the stars in your sleeping bag, then wake up for a swim in the waterfall.\n\nTHE SHOP: When you need more horse tack, head over to the shop — you'll find everything you need.\n\nTRAVEL BETWEEN LOCATIONS\nEach location gives you access to the horse transport, so you can get your horses, equipment, bikes and even characters from here to there. Put what you want to move into the transport, close the door and select the new location by tapping an icon. Everything will arrive in the selected location so you can begin your next adventure!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: stable, arena, forest and shop.\n- Create stories for 24 new characters plus horses and other animals!\n- Care for your horses: feed them, lather them up till they're nice and clean, brush them. \n- Choose outfits from your favorite themes: medieval, western, everyday stable life and fantasy!\n- Hop on to ride bikes in the forest and race motorcycles in the arena!\n- Set up obstacles and show off your horse's jumping skills!\n- Eat at the food court and use the portable potties!\n- Have a campout! \n- Snuggle into your sleeping bag to stay warm under the stars! \n- Take a canoe ride or swim by a waterfall.\n- Make music with magical lily pads!\n- Move horses, characters and objects from here to there in the horse transport! \n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nOne of our top requests for the Toca Life series has been horses!

      "label": "Bokstavkongen er et veldig fengende og unikt pedagogisk konsept som har blitt brukt i den norske skolen i flere år i forbindelse med bokstavopplæring. Bokstavkongen, - da lydene fikk bokstaver, tar barna med inn i en helhetlig, fantasifull verden med et eventyr til hver av bokstavene. Opplegget kan være en god hjelp til å bevisstgjøre barna på lydsiden ved ord. Det er lagt vekt på å skille mellom lyd og bokstav, noe som er svært viktig i den begynnende leseopplæringen. Begrepene vokal og konsonant blir innført, samt at bokstavene da får henholdsvis rød og blå farge.\n\nEventyrene er illustrert med enkle fargerike figurer som er fantasistimulerende for barna. Barna skal ha god tid til å leve seg inn i historiene mens de ser på bildene. De fengende historiene er lest av Nils Nordberg. Historiene er også tekstet slik at de voksne selv kan lese sammen med barna hvis de ønsker det. Slik er det åpnet for å bruke flere av barnets sansekanaler for å feste assosiasjonene mellom lyd og bokstav. Ikke minst ligger det her til rette for å høre historiene mange ganger, slik at barna kan lære bokstavene godt.\n\nEventyrene om de forskjellige bokstavene blir tilgjengelige i en rekkefølge som vi anbefaler å følge, særlig når de åtte-ti første bokstavene skal læres. Etter de fire første bokstavene råder vi til å lese eventyret som kan hjelpe barna til å forstå hvordan bokstavene blir til ord. Dette hjelper barna å knekke lesekoden. Historiene kan med fordel leses mange ganger.\n\nTil sammen er der 33 eventyr for alle lydene og tilleggshistoriene. Introduksjonseventyret om linjesystemet og bokstavslottet leses først. Det avsluttes med et eventyr om hvordan det ble orden på bokstavene, - alfabetet.\n\nI tillegg har Bokstavkonge-appen flere tilleggsfunksjoner, som minnespill hvor man bl.a kan finne store og små bokstaver som passer sammen. Barna kan også øve seg på å skrive bokstavene rett inn i bokstavslottet samt å fargelegge figurer og bokstaver fra historiene i tegneprogrammet. En ny modul er nå at man selv kan lage sine egne historier med elementer fra historiene.\n\nOg sist men ikke minst: Dere kan være med å synge alfabetsangen og se vår tegnefilm om alfabetet.\n\nVi håper både du og ditt barn kan ha stor glede av å ta del i alt som skjer i Bokstavlandet, og at denne appen vil gjøre leseopplæringen til en hyggelig opplevelse for barna."

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

Other built-in features of the HP 11C calculator include hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic trigonometric functions, combinations and permutations on probability, percent change, factorial, and absolute value. The main advantage of the 11C calculator is its programming capabilities. This allows for label addressing (0-9 and A-E), subroutines (nestable to 4 deep), 8 conditional tests, increment/decrement loops, and 2 flags. Users also have the option to redefine the number of certain keyboard keys."

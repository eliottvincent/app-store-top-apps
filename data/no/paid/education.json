      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Poio is a phonics and reading game that, in a short time, has helped more than 100,000 children learn how to read. In a study surveying more than 4,000 parents who use Poio with their children, over 85% report a significant positive impact on their child’s literacy learning.\n\n* Covers the first years of learning to read, from matching letters and sounds to reading a complex fairy-tale story with irregular words\n* The app is commonly used in preschools, primary schools, kindergartens and first grade as an introduction to literacy.\n\n“She astounded us with being able to read the story”\n— Grandmother to Ann (3)\n\n«With Poio, my sons now nag to practise reading» \n— dad to Noah (4) and James (6). \n\n«Unlike other apps we had used before, Poio showed the user letter and sounds in a wide variety of different formats – as letters, words and in sentences and within multiple different scenarios in the game.»\n— Victoria Galligan, QA Education Magazine\n\n\nTHE POIO METHOD\nPoio is a unique approach to phonics teaching, where children are in charge of their own learning journey.\n\n1. Poio is a game designed to engage your child through play and ignite their curiosity for reading.\n2. The game continuously adapts to each child's level of skill, providing a sense of mastery and keeping the child motivated.\n3. Keep track of your child’s achievements with our email reports, and get advice on how to initiate a positive dialogue to reinforce learning.\n4. The goal is for your child to read the story book to you, their siblings or impressed grandparents.\n\nEXPLORATION SPARKS CURIOSITY FOR THE STORY BOOK\nThe story takes place on a magical island, inhabited by a group of letter bugs called Readlings. Your child will help a troll, named Poio, learn how to read the storybook he has stolen from the Readlings. \n\nThese cute characters introduce letters, words and the story in a coherent fantasy world that unravels scene-by-scene. The game is full of tasks of increasing complexity, which helps the child to practice letter shapes, spell words and improve their phonetic awareness. Ultimately your child will make friends with all the Readlings and read the story book for the troll; and then for you, younger siblings or impressed grandparents.\n\n\nTHE GAME ELEMENTS\n\n#1 THE FAIRY TALE BOOK\nInside the game there is a book. It’s empty when your child starts playing. However, as the game unfolds, it will fill up with words and unravel the mysteries of the fantasy world.\n\n#2 THE READLINGS\nReadlings are cute bugs who eat alphabet letters. They are very picky about what they like, and have different personalities. The child controls them all!\n\n#3 A TROLL\nPoio, the main character of the game, catches the cute Readlings. He needs their help to read the book he has stolen from them. As they collected words at each level, children will spell them out in order to read the book.\n\n#4 STRAW ISLAND\nThe troll and the Readlings live on an island, in the forest, a desert valley and a winter land. The goal of each straw-level is to eat as many vowels as possible and find a new word for the book. A sub goal is to rescue all the trapped Readlings. To unlock the cages where the Readings are trapped, we give children phonic tasks to practice letter sounds and spelling.\n\n#5 HOUSES\nFor every Reading they rescue, children are rewarded with the opportunity to enter a special “house”. This gives them a break from the intense phonetics training. Here, they can use the gold coins they collect to furnish and decorate the house, while playing with the subjects and verbs of everyday objects.\n\n#6 COLLECTABLE CARDS\nThe cards encourage children to find new things and to practice more. The board of cards also serves as a playful instruction menu for the elements in the game.\n\n---\n\nTHE INVENTOR\nPoio is made by a father, teacher and tech-expert who quit his job to find a better way for children to crack the reading code. Our goal is to empower children all around the world to learn to read through play."

Boggatap fokuserer på trygg og inspirerende lek og har derfor verken tredjeparts reklame eller \"kjøp i app\"-ordninger. Vi samler heller ikke inn noe personlig data fra brukeren. De eneste lenkene til internet finner inne i \"foreldre-sonen\" som er sikret med en \"foreldre-lås\", altså utenfor barnas umiddelbare rekkevidde. Boggataps apper er med i \"KNOW what's inside\" - et program skapt av MOMs with apps og ACT som er en redaksjon av foreldre og pedagoger som leter etter trygge apper for barn, fri for reklame."

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

      "label": "The purpose of Crack the Reading Code is to teach what is practical for reading: \n- Shape\n- Writing direction\n- Sound. \n\nThese are the foundations of reading. \n\nChildren can acquire the essential knowledge that letters represent sounds, fit together and makes words that have meaning.\n \nThe content has been developed by experienced teachers - A supplement to writing textbooks and reading education\n\nChildren in kindergarten who are curious about letters will also think it's exciting. \n\n* THE SOUND OF THE LETTERS BEFORE THE NAMES.\n\nCrack the Reading Code uses exclusively letter sounds. \n\nChildren often learn the names of the letters instead of the sound of the letters. This means that they must apprehend something that they cannot use for their further reading. Often, they will have to relearn it when they are shown sounds at school that they have to use to read. \n\nBroadly speaking, they have no use for the letter names in the initial stages of reading. \n\n* THE 120 MOST USED WORDS AS WORD PICTURES.\n\nMany of the 120 most used words are not spelled as they sound. Therefore, it is a big help to recognize these as word pictures. \n\nChildren won't be forced to sound it out here, but instead just recognize the word like they recognize their own name or that a big yellow M means McDonald's. \n\nThat is why these 120 are trained as word pictures in Crack the Reading Code.\n\nUppercase letters for the intermediate learner.\n\nMany children first learn the 'big letters'. Of course, these must also be learned, but it should happen only when the child already recognizes the 'small letters.'\n\nIt is easier to relate to one shape per sound than two. \n\nWhen they have learned the lowercase letters, they can already recognize the letters in the books they must read. \n\nSwitching between the 'lowercase' and 'uppercase' in 'Settings.'\n\nSettings:\n\n-\tTurn the music in the menus on/off\n-\tHide the text direction. Hiding the text direction increases the level of difficulty.\n-\tSwitch between uppercase and lowercase letters. \n\nWe recommend that you only change to 'big letters' when the 'small letters' have been successfully learned.\n\nTarget audience:\n4 - 10 years (those who can't read or have a hard time doing so)."

Kun én av disse er riktig og hører sammen med bokstaven som er avbildet. Ved å lytte til alle bokstavlydene og dra den korrekte på plass, får man god trening i å koble bokstavlydene sammen med bokstavene.\n\nBokstavkongen\nBokstavkongen tilbyr et stort utvalg av læringsapper for skrive- og leseopplæring. Appene er godt egnet til bruk både hjemme og på skolen, og de er laget i samarbeid med spesialpedagoger og lærere.\n\nBokstavkongen bruker alltid bokstavlyder og ikke bokstavnavn, da det er bokstavlydene som er vikte og brukes når man skal lære seg å lese. Bokstavene representerer lyder man binder sammen til ord når man skal knekke lesekoden.\n\nBokstavkongen-appene fokuserer også på oppgaver, slik at barna får trening i å se ordene som ordbilder. Barna lærer de ordene som ikke er lydrette og er nødt til å gjenkjenne ordet som et bilde.\n\nHar du tilbakemeldinger og ønsker for enkelte av appene eller forslag til nye apper, så hører vi veldig gjerne fra deg!\n\nSend oss gjerne en e-post på post@bokstavkongen.no!\n\nFølg oss på Facebook: http://fb.me/bokstavkongen"

      "label": "We received the \"Editor´s Choice\" award by Apple for \"Little Fox Animal Doctor\" And in addition our app was awarded the \"Tech with Kids' Best Pick Award\" for exceptional design of a children's app. \n\nLittle Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4. Little Fox Animal Doctor is the first 3D-App by Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger. She is also the creative genius behind Nighty Night, Little Fox Music Box and Nighty Night Circus. Her Apps have been downloaded over 5 million times worldwide.                                                                                                                                  \n\nThe App will make your children’s dreams of being an Animal Doctor come true!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years.

Can you tell the difference between excitement and fear, or between aggression and the need to play?\r\n\r\nDog language can be confusing, but with the help of Dog Decoder, you’ll understand your dog’s signals like a pro.\r\n\r\nDog Decoder will teach you everything you need to know about how your dog communicates, so you can not only avoid bites, but share in a more satisfying, healthy, and loving relationship.\r\n\r\n=== MEET “DIAMOND” === \r\n\r\nDiamond is your tour guide and trainer. He will show you how he looks when he’s afraid, when he’s stressed, when he’s just about to bite, and when he wants to play. \r\n\r\n=== DOG POSTURES ===\r\n\r\nThere are about SIXTY different poses on display in Dog Decoder. Each pose is beautifully and expressively illustrated by one of the world’s top dog artists.\r\n\r\nEach pose comes with a diagram, pointing out where on Diamond’s body he’s indicating how he’s feeling. For example, in the poses for “fear,” the diagram will point out Diamond’s tucked tail, his ears pulled back, etc. We won’t just show you a picture of a scared dog — we’ll teach you what to look for, the signs of fear.\r\n\r\nEach pose also comes with a helpful description of the context. This is where you will learn about some common misconceptions, or what kinds of situations will cause your dog to assume each posture.\r\n\r\n=== TEST YOURSELF! ===\r\n\r\nThe best way to see how much you’ve learned is to take the quiz! Some of the quiz questions are pretty challenging. Diamond wants to make sure you don’t get fooled next time he’s hiding under the coffee table or drooling – will you recognize the early warning signs of stress? Will you be able to warn your children when your dog is clearly done playing?"

      "label": "***** 5/5 stars  EducationalAppStore.com *****\nLetraKid is an educational game addressed to children (4-8 years old) that can help them to learn pre-cursive and print block handwriting correctly, while having fun when doing so!\n\nWHAT KIDS CAN LEARN FROM THIS GAME\n\n• Recognize letter shapes and perfect alphabet pronunciation\n• The correct letter formation: start, checkpoints, strokes direction, order etc. Difficulty Levels 1 and 2 with assisted writing are designed to focus on the letter formation.\n• Develop fine motor skills for handwriting activity. Difficulty Levels 3 to 5 with freehand writing activities will focus on this improvement to help maximize confidence and form when writing.\n• Playing with a stylus pen will also help to improve standard pencil grasp. Any stylus compatible with the device will work.\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n• 16 languages with full support for interface, human native voices for letter/numbers pronunciation and full official alphabets. (ENGLISH, ESPAÑOL, FRANÇAIS, DEUTSCH, ITALIANO, PORTUGUÊS, NEDERLANDS, SVENSKA, NORSK, DANSK, SUOMI, ROMÂNĂ, JĘZYK POLSKI, TÜRKÇE, BAHASA INDONESIA and BAHASA MELAYU)\n• 3 popular letter formation rules that will provide flexibility for picking the right stroke order and direction for the child. Vital for improving grasp on key terms and rulings within handwriting.\n• Makes use of the 10 most used fonts in classes all over the world for learning pre cursive and print block handwriting: ZB style, HWT style, DN style, German(Hamburg) style and Euro Latino.\n• Full support for both Left and Right handwriting rules.\n• 5 difficulty levels with AUTO and LOCK settings, ranging from assisted writing for beginners, up to real freehand writing with minimal support and strict evaluation.\n• 4 set of glyphs: ABC (full alphabet for upper case letters), abc (full alphabet for lower case letters), 123 (numbers from 0 to 9) and a special set of signs for funny exercises.\n• 5 progression levels, color coded for each glyph that allows parents and teachers an instant evaluation of the progression and most exercised letters at the alphabet level.\n• 16 funny sticker rewards that will unlock after progression milestones are reached. Also, their drawing rules after each completed progression at Alphabet/glyph list level.\n• 3 profile slots with 50 funny avatars and name customization that will save independently the settings and the progression.\n• Full support for both Landscape and Portrait orientations.\n\nGREAT IN THE CLASSROOM!\n\nWith a unique and real-time feedback feature as well as complex tracing evaluation algorithms, LetraKid is not just another tracing app.\n\nThis is a new approach, focused on creating a fun game by utilizing handwriting mechanics itself. This avoids using distracting random rewards or secondary game mechanics that can break and confuse the learning process, optimizing learning progress and educational appeal to children.\n\nThe real time feedback will give both audio and graphic clues about the quality of the tracing and will adjust with difficulty level.\nOur tracing evaluation algorithms allow for an accurate and fun reward, using a 5 star rating for each exercise. This engages and motivates the kids to progress and to strive for more.\n\nDESIGNED for KIDS\n\n• No ads or irritating pop-ups.\n• No collection of personal data\n• Game settings are by default behind a parental gate. This can be disabled, but ensures a child to work with a certain font, formation rule, difficulty level and various other features for total specification to their needs.\n• External links are protected by a permanent parental gate and includes upgrade to full version, feedback and social media usage to help follow the latest news and changes with regards to the platform.\n\nGot any ideas for improving LetraKid? Then please send us your feedback and requests."

Your goal is to quiet your mind and become aware of that picture.\n\nYou select one of the two choices by pressing the answer which best matches your awareness of that image. When you do that, a second question\nwill appear. You then repeat the process. The Property Matches indicator at the bottom shows the number of correct answers to 24 questions.\n\nFour pictures will then appear. Tap the picture that best matches your mental image. The correct picture will fill the screen. After 12 pictures you may begin a new game.\n\nThis program offers feedback and reinforcement to meets the requirements for learning this skill. The Stargate ESP Trainer presents meaningful and emotional images to your subconscious mind. This ability is often called clairvoyance, and can enhance your life in many surprising ways."

Forklare og gi oversikt\n2. Gi praktiske løsninger, handlingsaternativ og strategier\n\nMålet er at” Mine sirkler” skal bidra til økt selvstendighet og kontroll over eget liv. Ved at at brukeren får en bedre forståelse av sosiale sammenhenger og til enhver tid har tilgang på løsninger og strategier, vil systemet bidra til bedre mestring og reduksjon av uro, angst og stress.\n\nInnholdet i \" mine sirkler\" må tilpasses den enkelte bruker og er lett å skreddersy. Når applikasjonen er lastet ned vil en få tilgang til en webside der metodikken er beskrevet og der en får eksempler på hva som kan skrives i de enkelte nivå i hver sirkel.

      "label": "Explore the deep sea and the animals that call it home. Play with and learn about sharks, penguins, octopuses, seahorses, turtles and many others!\n\nWith \"What’s in The Oceans?\" you can play and learn freely, with no pressure or stress. Play, observe, ask questions and find the answers. Explore how animals interact with each other, how they live, how they defend themselves and how they reproduce.\n\nLearn and get informed about the pollution of the oceans and its dangers. See how plastics, overfishing, climate change and ships affect the life and health of different ecosystems. We only have one planet — let's take care of it!\n\nWith five incredible ecosystems:\n\nSouth Pole\nDiscover the life of penguins, seals and orcas. Play with them! What do they eat and how do they live? How does climate change affect them?\n\nOctopuses\nFeed the sharks and learn how octopuses defend themselves and not be devoured. Try to protect the divers inside the shark cage!\n\nDolphins\nSee how the dolphins hunt, reproduce and come out to breathe. Play with them until it becomes night so they can go to sleep. Watch the fishing nets — if the dolphins get caught in them, they will not be able to come out to breathe.\n\nTurtles\nFeed the turtles and watch them lay eggs. Help the younglings to get out of the egg, and make sure the turtles don't eat the plastic bags, as they sometime mistake them for jellyfish. Look at the remoras — they always hitch a ride on the turtles.\n\nSeahorses\nSeahorses are small and fragile. Protect them from their predators, crabs, and make the algae and corals grow so they can hide.\n\nFeatures\n\n• Discover how animals live and how they interact in different ecosystems.\n• Play and learn with different marine animals: octopuses, crabs, sharks, turtles, jellyfish, seahorses, penguins, orcas, seals, remoras, starfish... And many others.\n• See how pollution and human activity are harming sea life.\n• With real videos of marine animals.\n• Suitable for all ages from 3+.\n\nABOUT LEARNY LAND\n\nAt Learny Land, we love to play, and we believe that games must form part of the educational and growth stage of all children; because to play is to discover, explore, learn and have fun.

      "label": "Bokstavkongen er et veldig fengende og unikt pedagogisk konsept som har blitt brukt i den norske skolen i flere år i forbindelse med bokstavopplæring. Bokstavkongen, - da lydene fikk bokstaver, tar barna med inn i en helhetlig, fantasifull verden med et eventyr til hver av bokstavene. Opplegget kan være en god hjelp til å bevisstgjøre barna på lydsiden ved ord. Det er lagt vekt på å skille mellom lyd og bokstav, noe som er svært viktig i den begynnende leseopplæringen. Begrepene vokal og konsonant blir innført, samt at bokstavene da får henholdsvis rød og blå farge.\n\nEventyrene er illustrert med enkle fargerike figurer som er fantasistimulerende for barna. Barna skal ha god tid til å leve seg inn i historiene mens de ser på bildene. De fengende historiene er lest av Nils Nordberg. Historiene er også tekstet slik at de voksne selv kan lese sammen med barna hvis de ønsker det. Slik er det åpnet for å bruke flere av barnets sansekanaler for å feste assosiasjonene mellom lyd og bokstav. Ikke minst ligger det her til rette for å høre historiene mange ganger, slik at barna kan lære bokstavene godt.\n\nEventyrene om de forskjellige bokstavene blir tilgjengelige i en rekkefølge som vi anbefaler å følge, særlig når de åtte-ti første bokstavene skal læres. Etter de fire første bokstavene råder vi til å lese eventyret som kan hjelpe barna til å forstå hvordan bokstavene blir til ord. Dette hjelper barna å knekke lesekoden. Historiene kan med fordel leses mange ganger.\n\nTil sammen er der 33 eventyr for alle lydene og tilleggshistoriene. Introduksjonseventyret om linjesystemet og bokstavslottet leses først. Det avsluttes med et eventyr om hvordan det ble orden på bokstavene, - alfabetet.\n\nI tillegg har Bokstavkonge-appen flere tilleggsfunksjoner, som minnespill hvor man bl.a kan finne store og små bokstaver som passer sammen. Barna kan også øve seg på å skrive bokstavene rett inn i bokstavslottet samt å fargelegge figurer og bokstaver fra historiene i tegneprogrammet. En ny modul er nå at man selv kan lage sine egne historier med elementer fra historiene.\n\nOg sist men ikke minst: Dere kan være med å synge alfabetsangen og se vår tegnefilm om alfabetet.\n\nVi håper både du og ditt barn kan ha stor glede av å ta del i alt som skjer i Bokstavlandet, og at denne appen vil gjøre leseopplæringen til en hyggelig opplevelse for barna."

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

These two features are its built-in random number generator and a backspace key that enables users to correct a problem or formula one number at a time. Other built-in features of the HP 11C calculator include hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic trigonometric functions, combinations and permutations on probability, percent change, factorial, and absolute value. The main advantage of the 11C calculator is its programming capabilities. This allows for label addressing (0-9 and A-E), subroutines (nestable to 4 deep), 8 conditional tests, increment/decrement loops, and 2 flags. Users also have the option to redefine the number of certain keyboard keys."

      "label": "Explore the human body and discover how your organs and muscles work. Play and learn as you watch the heart pump blood, where the food we eat passes, why a mosquito bite hurts us and much, much more!\nWith \"How does the Human Body Work?\" you can play and learn freely, with no pressure or stress. Play, observe, ask questions and find the answers. Have fun controlling your character, feeding him and cutting his nails. \n\nEnter our machine and watch how the blood platelets plug the wounds, how the muscles contract to kick a balloon or how a baby grows inside its mother. \n\nLearn and concentrate on healthy habits, watch how the lungs get sick if we breathe a lot of smoke, how running and exercise is good for your health and how the human body is healthier and stronger if you eat a balanced diet. We only have one body, let's take care of it!\n\nWith 9 incredible interactive scenes:\n\nCirculatory system\nZoom into the heart and see how it pumps blood. Discover white blood cells, platelets and red blood cells, and see how they work to make your body healthy. \n\nRespiratory System\nWatch your character inhale as see how the air goes to the lungs, bronchi and alveoli. Play by controlling your character and seeing how the rhythm of his breathing changes.\n\nUrogenital system\nLearn what the kidneys and bladder do. Interact with your character and help clean the blood and make him pee.  \n\nDigestive system\nWhat path does the food follow from its entry into the human body until the waste comes out? Feed the character and help him absorb the nutrients and dispose of the waste. \n\nNervous System\nObserve how the nerves of the whole body are activated and how the senses work: sight, smell, hearing... and also learn about the brain and its various parts.  \n\nSkeletal System\nIn this system, you'll learn how the skeleton is made up of many bones, how they give us mobility and allow us to walk, jump, run... and how your bones are responsible for generating the blood of our body. \n\nMuscular System\nLearn how your body contracts and relaxes the muscles to help us move, protect us and learn the names of the most important muscles. You can turn your character around and see that we have other muscles on the other side!\n\nThe Skin \nDiscover how the skin protects us and how it responds to cold and heat. Watch how the hairs grow, clean the sweat of your character and play by cutting its nails and painting them. \n\nPregnancy\nTake care of the pregnant woman, take her blood pressure, do an ultrasound and observe how a baby is forming inside her. \n\nSuitable for all ages, starting at 4 years old.\n\nABOUT LEARNY LAND\n\nAt Learny Land, we love to play, and we believe that games must form part of the educational and growth stage of all children; because to play is to discover, explore, learn and have fun.

Vi spesialiserer oss på apper for barn, gjerne med en pedagogisk vri. Målet er å skape læring gjennom kreativ atspredelse - digitale leketøy som skal invitere både barna og foreldrene til å leke sammen. Boggatap fokuserer på trygg og inpirerende lek og har derfor verken tredjeparts reklame eller \"kjøp i app\"-ordninger. Vi samler heller ikke inn noe personlig data fra brukeren. De eneste lenkene til internet finner inne i \"foreldre-sonen\" som er sikret med en \"foreldre-lås\", altså utenfor barnas umiddelbare rekkevidde. Boggataps apper er med i \"KNOW what's inside\" - et program skapt av MOMs with apps og ACT som er en redaksjon av foreldre og pedagoger som leter etter trygge apper for barn, fri for reklame."

Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation. Turn into an astronomer and explore planets, moons, satellites, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, stars and other celestial bodies. Enjoy gorgeous graphics and visuals while navigating through the solar system!\n\n► Make virtual flights from one space object to another.\n\n► Travel in time and see what the universe and our Solar system looked like at a certain period.\n\n► Find an exciting view of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n► Watch a collection of educational solar system movies to learn about space-related topics including Earth's moon phases, Earth's cycles, tidal phenomena, and zodiacal constellations.*\n\n► Enjoy 3D planetarium with the help of special glasses and activating the anaglyph mode.\n\n► Share interesting screenshots of the app with your friends.\n\n► Choose the view mode comfortable for you (orrery/true-to-scale).\n\n*Available through In-App Purchases.\n\nSolar Walk is a great educational tool appropriate for both adults and children.

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

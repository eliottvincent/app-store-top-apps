Then you probably own a circulator or a similar device. To start, a zip-bag, a cooking pot and a thermometer is all you need. Many Sous Vide recipes work without special equipment. But you will need good advice!\n\nSous Vide has been adopted in professional kitchens for producing precise and consistent results. The Sous Vide method produces perfectly cooked food with outstanding flavor. Its success in high-end cuisine changed the culinary world. With a few starting tips anyone can use this technique. Step-by-step tutorials and Sous Vide timers (mini-recipes with an alarm) help you along the way.\n\nIdeas, suggestions or anything you would like to change? Contact us with your feedback on UserVoice!\n\nThe time for a piece of meat to reach a core temperature can be calculated. A formula using thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and surface heat transfer calculates the time such shapes as cylinders, cubes and steaks need to acquire a certain core temperature. Consider the PolyScience Toolbox App or Douglas Baldwin’s formulas for calculating pasteurization times.\n\nBut food is never an exact geometrical shape and waiting for an extra hour for a piece to reach an additional half a degree is impractical. Adjustments for speed and efficiency improve the Sous Vide experience. We have tested Sous Vide recommendations that work and tutorials that make the first steps easy - for professionals and home cooks alike!\n\nSous Vide - no other cooking method gives you so much control!\n\nDon’t get the Anova Pro or the new Anova Precision Cooker (2019) as these devices are no longer equipped with Bluetooth!"

Healthy can (and should) taste good… and become an enjoyable part of your lifestyle. Today, Jen shares that passion as creator of Simple Green Smoothies."

      "label": "Sugar is in everything these days, from boxed cereals to pasta sauces; it's almost impossible to avoid unless you're eating a real food diet. The 7 Day Sugar-Free Detox was designed by the Young and Raw team of expert nutritionists and holistic health coaches to create a fun and cleansing experience for you while you break free from the chains of sugar. \n\nStudies show sugar can be highly addictive, so rest assured we've got your back when it comes to kicking it for good! Inside this detox, you're going to find two meal plans to choose from. Our Low-Sugar Plan has small amounts of natural sugar found in fruits. Our No-Sugar Plan is completely sugar free.\n\nRefined or processed sugar is incomplete in its nutrient profile, lacking minerals and vitamins required by our bodies for digestion. What ends up happening when we eat sugar, is our bodies have to seek out the proper minerals required for digestion and unfortunately, those minerals are \"borrowed\" from our mineral reserves. This can lead to mineral deficiency and other health issues that are today, considered \"modern diseases\". \n\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox is designed to support:\n- Breaking sugar addiction\n- Weight loss\n- Liver & Kidney detox\n- Skin health \n- Balancing blood sugar \n- Mood balancing\n- Energy levels\n- Adrenal fatigue\n\nInside the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox you will find:\n- Low-Sugar Meal Plan which includes some fruit sugars\n- No-Sugar Meal Plan which is 100% sugar free\n- Recipes - along with a list of health benefits for each recipe\n- Shopping lists - to make shopping quick and easy, you can tick off items from the list\n- Morning and evening routines - including how to get a perfect night of sleep\n- Young and Raw's favorite books, quotes & documentaries\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the plan work to reset the body?\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox was carefully crafted by experts to get you results while maintaining your sanity throughout the process! \n\nBy replacing sugar with fresh leafy greens, vegetables, seaweeds and seeds along with an abundance of healthy fats, your body will be less hungry for sugar. In the beginning, you may notice a withdrawal period as your body adjusts to running off of fat and real food rather than sugar and carbohydrates. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, it's not easy, but we know you can do it!\n\nThe meal plans have everything you need to detox, and because there are no added or refined sugars your liver and kidneys will get a much needed break from processed sugar.\n\nFor 7 days you're going to experience what it's like to enjoy only real, whole foods but don't forget that diet is only one part of the equation. Proper detox also includes getting enough fresh clean water and optimizing your sleep. Our sleep cycles ensure the body gets its time to effectively detox, renew and heal. The included sleep protocol was designed based on all of the information we have about the importance of optimized sleep and the experiments we have done, to create a protocol that really works. \n\nYour herbal protocol is always optional and if you're on any medications, pregnant or have a health condition, it's advised that you speak with your physician and consult an herbalist prior to taking new supplements. The herbal protocol is minimal yet powerful, including some of the most elite herbs for detoxing the liver, kidneys, creating clear skin and boosting energy in the process. \n\nIn Summary, the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox helps to reset the body by:\n- Gently cleansing the body and promoting toxin elimination\n- Gently introducing blood cleansing foods\n- Providing the body with enough healthy fats to begin removing a reliance upon sugar and processed carbohydrates\n- Encouraging a healthy sleep cycle \n- Creates a movement routine to stimulate the lymphatic system, the endocrine system and the detox organs\n- Hydrating effectively to flush the body of excess toxins and create electrolyte balance"

      "label": "Allert is the food allergy app for travelers.\n\nHaving a food allergy is a reason for many people not to travel abroad. After all, how are you going to tell people about your situation when you don't speak the local language? \n\nOur app assists you in solving this problem. \n\n▶ FEATURES\n● Works everywhere and anywhere; no network, data, or WiFi required.\n● Allert's 14 supported allergies cover 95% of all food allergy cases: Peanuts, Tree Nuts, Dairy, Eggs, Fish, Shellfish, Soy, Gluten, Mustard, Celery, Sesame Seeds, Sulfur Dioxide, Lupine, and Mollusca.\n● 44 supported languages allow you to communicate your dietary needs in almost every country in the world: Arabic, Bengali, Burmese, Catalan, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Kannada, Khmer, Korean, Malay, Malayalam, Maori, Marathi, Nepali, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, and Vietnamese.\n● Are you following a vegetarian or vegan diet? Allert has you covered with five different vegetarian lifestyle choices to display alongside the allergy warning: Lacto-Ovo Pescatarian, Lacto-Ovo vegetarian, Lacto Vegetarian, Ovo Vegetarian, Vegan.\n● Human translations only. We hired native speakers for each language to ensure the highest accuracy possible. All translations have been triple-checked by at least two different people.\n● Allert contains a mini-guide filled with useful tips and advice to deal with your food allergies during your travels.\n\n▶ BACKSTORY\nA rudimentary pre-release version of Allert has been rigorously field-tested across the globe by one of the members of the development team, who is severely allergic to dairy and peanuts. After visiting eight countries with languages and alphabets foreign to him, he arrived back home alive and well. The app got positive responses and compliments from locals on top of that, which was our cue to kickstart the development of Allert and turn it into an actual app. After more than two years of hard work, we are finally here.\n\nKeep an eye on our website. We have big plans for the future of helping people with allergies through smart apps: https://allertapp.com\n\n▶ VERSION HISTORY\n\n1.2 (July 20, 2020)\n-Made the app compliant with the latest version of iOS.\n-Improved the functionality for the contact form for people running a third-party email app.\n-Streamlined the onboarding process.\n-Optimized some code to make things leaner & meaner.\n-Fixed a visual glitch in the welcome-screen.\n-Added images for 6.5\" iPhones to the App Store.\n\n1.1 (January 2020)\n-Internal/experimental release.\n\n1.0.1 (Aug 12, 2018)\n-Tidied up Dutch language output.\n-UI optimizations.\n\n1.0 (July 21, 2018)\n-Initial release."

      "label": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

It's what our grandma's have been telling us for years: \"Eat real foods that are healthy, avoid highly processed factory foods and you'll feel better and live happier\".\n\nWhether you call it Paleo, real food, low carb, low sugar, grain-free, gluten-free ancestral, nutrient-dense, primal or whole food - the important thing is that the Paleo diet is a healthier way of eating. The list of benefits people have reported is enormous: \n● Weight loss ● More energy that doesn't vary wildly throughout the day ● Improved sleep ● Clearer skin ● Better digestion ● Improved fitness ● Reduced allergies. The list goes on but it's better to try it for yourself.\n\nThe 250 Paleo recipes included will help satisfy your cravings for delicious, healthy food. Inside Caveman Feast you'll find healthy breakfasts, filling main meals, tasty desserts, side dishes and snacks. \n\nRecipes include:\n● Perfect paleo burger\n● Paleo french toast\n● Healthy caveman cookies \n● Blueberry espresso brownies\n● Grilled buffalo shrimp\n● Smoked avocado lime pork chops\n● Apple dijon burgers\n● Homemade healthy mayonnaise\n● Caveman crunch bars\n● Sweet potato pasta\n● Beasty BBQ sauce\n● Caveman shepherd's pie\n\nFeatures in the app include:\n● Add recipes to your shopping list and see it organised by aisle, saving time at the grocery store\n● Track your calories and macros with our nutritional data\n● Increase or decrease recipe servings\n● Search by ingredient\n● Add notes to recipes\n● Share recipes with friends\n● Switch the measurement units\n● Plan a week of meals\n● Tick off your shopping list on your Apple Watch\n● Integrated with Apple Health\n\nThe quick and easy to follow recipes are by New York Times bestselling author George Bryant of civilizedcavemancooking.com. After decades in a constant battle with his weight and nearly losing both his legs while on deployment as a U.S. Marine, George decided to change his life. He went Paleo. What started as a simple website to share recipes with friends, has since grown into an award-winning food blog. After being in the Marines for 12 years, George now enjoys creating delicious Paleo recipes full-time, hoping to change as many lives as he can with real food recipes.\n\nGeorge works in collaboration with Abel James from the chart topping podcast \"The Fat-Burning Man show\" where he covers the Paleo lifestyle. Abel has been featured in Men's Health, Popular Science and Wired Magazine. You'll find exclusive content from Abel inside the app.\n\nNote: For users upgrading\nCaveman Feast 3.0 is available as a free update on iOS 9.3 and above.

You can add your own favorite cheeses to the standard library and include personal notes about any of the cheeses.\n\nSearching within the library for that special cheese can be by name, country, milk-type, texture, or by your own custom tags (such as #atmystore).\n\nSo, if you’re a classically trained chef, professional party planner, cheese buyer, or just plain cheese lover, grab Fromage, your favorite wine, and experience the wonderful and historic flavors of cheese.\n_________________________________\n\nFromage comes with the ability to create personal cheese notes, rate cheeses from 1 to 5 stars (included an “Avoid” rating), add cheeses to your favorite lists (Try, Buy, or Favorites categories), record tasting impressions with up to 70 tasting keywords, and search the cheese library.\n\nYou can also enter your own cheeses (including photos captured from your device camera) and list those cheeses automatically in the “My Additions” category.  There is also a “Share” feature so cheese information can be sent (via e-mail) to friends or to the developer for inclusion in future versions of Fromage. \n_________________________________\n\nInternet or Wi-Fi connection is not required for program use, which is great for remote locations when no data plan is available.\n\nWhen internet is available, Fromage uses iCloud to synchronize your cheese entries and notes between all of your Apple devices which can include iPhone, iPad, and Macintosh.\n\nThe application provides English, French, Spanish, and German languages when the iOS device settings are set to that language."

If we guessed wrong, just tap on the ingredients in a recipe to switch back and forth.\n\nMULTI INGREDIENT SEARCH\nSearching for drinks with one or more ingredients is trivial. Go ahead, find all the drinks with Rum, Lime Juice, and Orange Liqueur. It's actually quite fun.\n\nCURATED SHORTLISTS\nPicking a drink out of a list of hundreds is overwhelming. Try looking through one of our curated shortlists. Whether it's Brunch, Girls Night Out, or just some Rest for the Wicked, we probably have a list for you.\n\nFLAVOR PROFILES\nAre you in the mood for lime or strawberry? Or maybe coffee? Either way, the flavor lists will help you find what you are looking for.\n\nSAVE YOUR FAVORITES\nLet's be honest, your memory is not at its best when drinking. Tap the heart next to a drink to add it to your favorites, so you can remember what to blame for your hangover.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n* Sort by drink name or by glass type.\n* Search ingredients and drinks by name.\n* Automatic updates when new recipes are added.\n* Works offline. Recipes are stored locally so you can use the app anywhere."

Rather, to give you information that will make you knowledgeable and able to communicate what makes wines unique, Approach Guides provides an in depth look at a wine region's grapes, appellations, and vintages.  \n\nWHAT THE WINE PRESS HAS TO SAY \n• Food & Wine Magazine: “Only God (and Google) knows how many wine apps exist...Some are great, some not so much. But these seven are crucial.\" Approach Guides is the best for \"Wine Lessons.”\n• Decanter Magazine: \"Dozens of apps offer background details on regions, varieties, and food pairings, but some are more accurate and usable than others. Approach Guides is the most complete and user-friendly. You can search by style, region, grape or food match, and entries are cross-referenced. It also supplies a guide to vintages for each region and plentiful maps...\" \n\nSUPPORTED WINE-PRODUCING REGIONS\nThe app supports — profiling all regions, appellations and grape varieties — Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and USA (Sonoma, Napa, Washington State and Willamette Valley). We expect to add support for South Africa in 2017.\n\nDevelopment by Amudo LLC\n\nTRANSFORM YOUR WINE EXPERIENCE.

      "label": "Steak Master – for the Perfect Steak   \n\n*******\n- Number 1 in the App Store Top 10 \"Food & Drink\" in Germany (2014, 2015, 2016)\n\n– Recommended by famous german newspapers including 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung', 'NZZ' or 'Lecker' (2014)\n\n- Tested and recommended by german TV Shows like 'SAT.1-Frühstücksfernsehen' or RTL2 'Schau dich schlau'\n*******\n\nSteak Master - Your steak companion    \n\nPreparing the perfect steak sure isn’t easy and needs a lot of experience, which not all of you have. The effects could be serious – you want the steak medium but it’s still dripping blood. Or your anticipated rare steak is overdone and tough as leather.\n\nBut, it doesn’t have to be that way. The Steak Master is easy to use and will help you cook your steaks just as you like them every time.\n\nThe perfect preparation of steaks with the Steak Master is simple:\n\n1. First, you determine the type of temperature scale on your oven’s temperature control knob by tapping on the configuration button. That is important, because the Steak Master needs this information in order to give you the correct oven temperature later on. You only have to do this once per oven.\n\n2. Decide if you want to use just a frying pan or both frying pan and oven (the professional way). Using only the frying pan is much quicker than the use of frying pan and oven. The meat never leaves the pan until it’s done, whereas the slightly longer expert’s way requires both frying pan and oven, but results in perfectly juicy steaks.  \n\n3. Most important: The thickness of the steak and how you would like to have your steak . The Steak Master helps you to define both. Just tap on the pictures or the controller under the pictures and select how well done you would like to have your steak. Then tap on „Thickness of steak“, hold the steak sideways next to your iPhone/iPod and measure its thickness with your index finger.\n\n4. Here we go! The Steak Master guides you step by step through the menu, tells you what you need and shows you what to do in chronological order. For example how much you have to heat up the butter/oil in your frying pan.\n\n5. When your butter/oil is slightly bubbling it’s time to sear the steak. The Steak Master counts down the time before you have to turn over the steak.\n\n6. After searing your meat you just follow the instructions the Steak Master is giving you. Did you choose the cooking with the frying pan, reduce the heat to the temperature the Steak Master states on the display and simply finish the cooking in the pan. How long you have to cook and how often you have to turn the meat – the Steak Master-App has got the answer! A small treat are the Steak-Spy and the Steak-O-Meter:  they show you the condition and the progress of the steak during the cooking phase until it‘s finished. Then take the meat out of the pan, wrap it up with tin foil and let it rest. How long? The Steak Master tells you automatically.\n\n7. If you decided to use a frying pan and the oven it’s the same method, only that you have to follow the additional instructions of the Steak-Master-App for the use of the oven. Either way you choose – the result is a perfectly cooked steak and a great meal. Enjoy!\n\nHighlights\n\n- The Steak-Master calculates from the thickness of the steak and the chosen steak result (e.g. rare or medium) exactly to the second the time the steak needs to cook.\n\n- The formula is based on hundreds of tests by experienced steak experts.\n\n- Fool-proof preparation: simply determine thickness of the steak, the way you would like to have the steak done and follow the illustrated instructions of the App step by step.\n\n- The Steak Spy shows you the inside of the steak during the cooking progress."

Which one do you buy for a beginner?\n► What can I expect from a Edelzwicker from Alsace?\n► Am I more of a Margaux or Pauillac drinker?\n► How long should I cellar Barolo or Sauternes?\n► What types of sherry are there and what do they taste like?\n\nBy using the filter function, you can see, for example, in which regions a grape variety is frequently grown or an aroma often found.  \n\nIf you want to know more about wine aromas and tasting terms, we recommend you download our app \"Wine tasting - easy and fun\" from the Store. It is available in a discounted bundle.\n\nThis app is based on the successful book \"Die Weinsteckbriefe\" (The Wine Profiles) by Kurt Gibel, who also published the book bestseller \"Weine degustieren - leicht & spielend\" (Wine Tasting – Relaxed and Easy) (2020: 20th edition)."

      "label": "How many of us struggle with \"kitchen math?\" The Kitchen Calculator PRO app makes cooking and measuring so much easier. Kitchen Calculator PRO does all the recipe conversions for you, and makes it simple to scale recipes up (or down) to change the number of servings the recipe yields. With Kitchen Calculator PRO you can:\n\n1.Quickly scale your recipes (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using fractions!\n\n2.Convert ingredients from weight to volume, and vice versa ( cups to grams, ounces,  etc. )\n\n3.Supports several volume, weight, distance, and temperature conversions\n\n4.Enter amounts and view results in standard cooking fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc )\n\n5.Grow a database with your favorite ingredients! (see weight to volume )\n\n\nUSER COMMENTS\n\n***** Exactly what I've been looking for! - \"I just tested this out on a new cake recipe and it was simple, easy and accurate. The cake came out *perfect*!\" by njanehair.\n\n***** Yippee, perfection! - \"I cook 3 meals a day for my toddler and am always needing to scale recipes down so I'm not making ridiculous amounts of food\" by Cindi M.\n\n***** Brilliant - \"For a cook trained in the metric system, this tool is a dream come true\" by BeeDiana.\n\n\nSCALE YOUR RECIPES\n\nEasily convert and scale recipes in an instant. Doubling a recipe (or cutting a recipe in half) is simpler than ever before, with all the most common units of cooking measurement right at your fingertips. \n\n\nWEIGHT TO VOLUME CONVERSIONS\n\nWhat is so special about weight to volume conversions?\n\nWhen converting from weight to volume it is important to take into account the ingredient you are converting. As you know, a cup of sugar does not weigh the same as a cup of rice. Furthermore, a particular brand of sugar may weigh different from another.  This is all made easy with Kitchen Calculator PRO.\n\nSo, how does Kitchen Calculator handle weight to volume conversions?\n\n1.It comes with a database of common ingredients based on weight figures from the USDA (US Department of Agriculture).\n\n2.It allows you to quickly enter and save your own ingredient weight for more precise conversions.  In many cases, you can enter the values right off the product label, using fractions!  \n\n3.Kitchen Calculator will remember any saved ingredient information for future conversions.\n\nNOTE: The preset ingredient list is based on USDA  (US Department of Agriculture) figures and are approximate values. They may differ from the ingredients you use. For precise calculations we recommend entering the weights for your ingredients and, whenever possible using a scale.\n\nINGREDIENT DATA SOURCE\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 2007. USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 21.

We used the rule of thumb that women need 2000 calories and men need 2400 calories per normal day and on a Fast Day you should eat a quarter of a normal day’s recommended calories.\n\nBut these normal values are just estimates, to get the maximum out of the 5:2 Fast Diet you should consume a quarter of the calories needed to maintain your particular weight. This value is different for each person because it takes into account your gender, age, weight, height & normal activity level.\n\nOur calculator app will allow you to more accurately work out your Rest Day Calorie Intake and therefore your more accurate Fast Day intake."

Learn about teas from all over the world with Tea's Encyclopedia, including preparation tips, signs of quality, tasting notes, harvest seasons and more. Brew the perfect cup every time with Tea's smart tea timer and note taker. Whether you're looking up what \"Sencha\" is when you're at a cafe or refining your oolong's steep time to perfection, Tea's got you covered.\n\n**Features**\n\n• Tea Encyclopedia: Learn about teas from all over the world with Tea's all-new Encyclopedia: where they're grown, how they're made, preparation tips, signs of quality, and more! Tea can now recognize over 500 tea names.\n\n• Tea to Try: Tea's Encyclopedia integrates with Reminders to allow you to create a list of teas to try.\n\n• Smart Tea Timer: Tea's terrific timer remembers your favorite brew times for each of your teas. \n\n• Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram Integration: With the tap of a button, you can have Tea share your tasting notes and photos with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\n• Teapot Picker: Tea's teapot picker lets you choose which teapot you'll use to brew your tea, and can even automatically tell you how much tea you'll need for that teapot.\n\n• Notes and Rating System: After your timer is up, Tea lets you save tasting notes, take a photo and rate your brew. Tea even keeps track of your brewing time, tea amount, and temperature, so that you can hone in on the perfect brew for each of your teas. \n\n• Default Brew Suggestions: Not all teas are meant for use with boiling water. Tea comes pre-loaded with brew suggestions (temperature, time, leaf amount) for over 200 tea names and 12 tea types, all prepared by tea expert Thomas Smith. \n\n• Automatic Unit Conversion: Tea's Set Brew screen automatically converts units for you. If your tea's temperature instructions come in degrees Celsius, for example, Tea automatically converts it to Fahrenheit if that is your preferred unit.\n\n• Inventory Tracker: When you input a new tea, Tea automatically calculates how many brews you can make with that tea. Each time you use Tea's timer, Tea recalculates how many brews you have remaining. Be in full command of your tea inventory.\n\n• Multiple Infusion Support: Tea intelligently counts your tea infusions and preloads your notes with infusion number.\n\n• Shake to Shuffle: Can't decide on which tea to have? Simply give your iOS device a shake, and Tea will select one at random for you!"

I would of paid 100 pounds for this had I know the contents before purchasing. I can tell LOADS of work has gone into this and you are sharing some amazing energy for little. Well well done. Thank you so much.\"\n- Michael Todd, Director of the UKH Gro\n\n\"I love this app! So many recipes!\"\n- Serge Gobachev \n\n\"Lost two lbs in four days!\"\n- Andrea Ward\n\n\"Awesome dishes.

I Love it :)\"\n- Jasmine Ogana\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe only thing that matters when it comes to diet plans is if it works!\n\nBased on over 20 years of research the Dukan Diet is one of the most popular books and diet plans in France. It is a protein-based diet designed by French nutritionist and dietician, Pierre Dukan.\n\nThe diet consists of 4 phases: attack, cruise, consolidation, and stabilization.\n\nThe attack phase is designed to enable dieters to rapidly lose 2 to 3 kilograms (4.4 to 6.6 lb) in 2–7 days by kick-starting their metabolism. Dieters are allowed to eat as much as they want of 72 protein-rich foods.\n\nThe cruise phase is designed to allow dieters to more gradually achieve the weight they aim for by eating protein-rich foods with the addition of 28 specific vegetables. \n\nThe consolidation phase is designed to help in preventing any future massive weight gain. During this phase, fruit, bread, cheese and starchy foods are reintroduced into a normal diet, leaving two celebratory meals a week as directed by the plan.\n\nFinally, in the stabilization phase, dieters can essentially eat whatever they want without gaining weight by following a few lifestyle rules: protein day once a week, eating oat bran every day and making a fitness commitment to \"take the stairs\". Dieters should follow this last phase for the rest of their life to avoid regaining weight.\n\n- Features an elegant and intuitive interface\n\n- Over 300 dukan food recipes\n\n- Recipes for all meal types including: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack\n\n- Star your favorites for easy reference\n\n- Filter menu to sort\n\n- Search feature to quickly find your favorite recipe\n\nDownload Dukan Diet Pro and start feeling healthier today!"

You use a simple interface to plan out meals like “Hamburgers on Thursday, Fish and Rice on Friday”. Recent meals are easily available or you can type in new items the first time you use them.\n\nMealPlan is a universal app, and will sync between your iPhone and iPad using either iCloud or Dropbox. Plan your meals on the iPad's big screen, and automatically have your grocery list with you on your phone. And access your grocery list from your Apple Watch.\n\nMealPlan creates your grocery list as you're planning meals. When you're done, tap the Grocery Basket to see the list, add new items, mark off items you already have, and then print it, email it, or sync it with your iPhone. This is a huge time saver!\n\nAnd, on the iPad, once you’ve used the app for a few weeks, the Magic Wand will help you quickly fill out subsequent weeks, with a quick suggestions interface.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Simple interface to plan out meals.\n- Keep track of recipes and the groceries they use.\n- Automatically generated grocery list based on your meal plan.\n- Save grocery lists for later use (think \"Party\" or \"Camping\").\n- Save a week's planned meals as a template to reuse.\n- Combined search/add box makes it easy to add new items.\n- Print out a week's plan to any AirPrint printer.\n- Configure your own meals: Add snacks, or remove breakfast if you don't want to plan it.\n- Email a plain text summary of the week's plan.\n- Add a note to any meal item, including clickable links.\n- Dropbox sync for families with multiple devices and accounts.\n- Use Siri for groceries: \"Add Milk to my Grocery List\".\n\n\"Before MealPlan, I’d buy food at the grocery store and then forget I had it .. a few days later it would go to waste. A few minutes every week standing in front of the fridge with MealPlan in hand will help you get the most out of what you have on hand. Plan it, print it out and stick it to your fridge!\"\n\nVisit the website for more information, and a detailed walkthrough of what MealPlan can do."

The best-selling cookbook, Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking, by me, Michael Ruhlman, is now an iPhone app that will help you calculate amounts of ingredients in all the fundamental culinary preparations.  When you know a ratio, you don’t know a recipe, you know 1,000.  And this application does all the calculating for you.\n\n “Cooking, like so many other creative endeavors is defined by relationships.  For instance, knowing exactly how much flour to put into a loaf of bread isn’t nearly as useful as understanding the relationship between the flour and the water, or fat, or salt.  That relationship is defined by a ‘ratio’ and having a ratio in hand is like having a secret decoder ring that frees you from the tyranny of recipes. ….Michael Ruhlman, in handing us mortals a power better suited to the gods, has changed the balance of kitchen power forever.” —Good Eats host Alton Brown\n\n\nWhat You Get:\n\n--THE 32 CRITICAL RATIOS that form the backbone of the culinary arts, with instructions: doughs, batters, meat preparations, custards, sauces (pasta dough and pizza dough, sponge cake and pancakes, fritters and crepes, stocks and sauces, crème caramel and chocolate sauce.\n\n--A CALCULATOR that figures out how much of each ingredient you need, no matter how many or how few people you want to serve.\n\n--An OUNCES-TO-GRAMS CONVERTER (ratios work no matter what unit you choose to use!).\n\n--DELICIOUS VARIATIONS FOR RECIPES on all the ratios, ideas for the creation of new dishes according to your tastes.\n\n--An easy way to STORE YOUR OWN RECIPES and notes that you’ve created from the basic ratios.\n\n--Quick fun ways to SHARE what your cooking with your fellow cooks, on Facebook and on Twitter.\n\n--Ratios is also a great way to understand and TWEAK YOUR OWN RECIPES, to help you make your pancakes even fluffier, your pizza dough crisper, your crème brulee richer."

We'd love to help you get cooking!***\n\n#1 Food & Drink App and featured as one of Apple's \"Best New Apps\"!\n\nIt’s the Webby Award-winning app from Michelle Tam and Henry Fong, the James Beard Award nominated creators of Nom Nom Paleo—now available for both iPad and iPhone! Michelle and Henry’s Saveur Award winning food blog and New York Times bestselling cookbook are just the tip of the iceberg—this newly updated app makes cooking even more fun and inspirational, and takes all the guesswork out of cooking. Plus, now that the Nom Nom Paleo app’s available for iPhone, you can take these nomtastic recipes with you anywhere!\n\nFeatures:\n \n● Over 145 simple, tantalizing recipes, all free of gluten, soy, and refined sugar, sortable by food category, searchable by ingredients and category—the vast majority of which are approved for the Whole30® nutritional re-set program. You’ll find lots of recipes that are exclusive to this app, and not available on the Nom Nom Paleo website or cookbook. \n\n● More recipes are being added regularly! You won’t have to wait until future app updates—new recipes can now be added automatically to the app on your device!\n\n● More than 2,000 stunning, high-resolution photos showing every step of the cooking process.\n\n● Fun and visually-engaging new user interface and design, including a home display that allows you to quickly scroll through and visually select recipes.\n\n● Simple-to-follow instructions, including tips, shortcuts, and information about food and techniques.\n\n● An interactive, email-friendly grocery list that syncs across devices and makes food shopping a breeze.\n\n● An extensive “Paleo 101” primer that explains the benefits of the “caveman” diet and provides resources for more information about ancestral health and nutrition.\n\n● A Whole30-friendly 30-day sample meal plan with links to recipes.\n\n● An in-depth shopping guide with product reviews and links to sources for cooking tools and ingredients.\n\n● The ability to bookmark recipes, create a personalized category of favorite recipes, and add notes.\n\n● A “constant-on” function to prevent the screen from dimming while you cook.\n  \n● The ability to email complete recipes and shopping lists.\n\nPraise for Nom Nom Paleo:\n\n● The “Martha Stewart of Paleo.” –The New York Times\n\n● “Oddly provocative.” –Christopher Kimball of America’s Test Kitchen\n\n● “A must-have app.” –AppCraver\n\n● “Brilliantly designed.” –Apps Magazine\n \n● “Visually stunning.” –Gear Diary\n\n● “Always popping with flavor.” –The Kitchn\n\n● “Truly extraordinary.” –Michael Ruhlman, James Beard Award-winning food writer\n \nMessage from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:\n\nHey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!\n\nThis “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.\n \nBut that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.\n \nMy hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!\n \n● App development by Y Media Labs ●"

Till varje uppslagsord ges en förklaring och eventuell funktion. Du får också information om ingrediensen och om den innehåller gluten, laktos, mjölk- eller sojaprotein.\nAppen är säker och enkel; ingen information skickas vidare, profiler och sökningar görs endast i din telefon och det behövs inte någon internetuppkoppling för användning.\n\nIngredienslexikon är utvecklad av företaget Trygg Mat i samarbete med Celiakiförbundet och Gothia Fortbildning."

Works with LTE!\n\n*** Message Extension ***\nQuickly send your recent check-ins to your friends in iMessage.\n\n*** Distinct Beers ***\nThat was an awesome märzen you had last fall, but now you're in the store a year later and can't remember just which brewery it was from. Type a few letters into Tappd That and view your ratings, all without an Internet connection.\n\n*** Activity Feed ***\nWant to see what your friends are drinking? Tappd That has you covered with the Activity view. You can toast your friends and comment on their check-ins, all from within Tappd That (activity data is not stored offline).\n\n*** Wish List ***\nDon't be the only Untappd user struggling to find bandwidth to pull up your wish list at GABF. Save your wish list to Tappd That to have instant access to the names of those brews you really want to SAVOR. Want to add or remove a beer from your list? Do a search and swipe half-right. Your wish list will be updated immediately and synced to Untappd.\n\n*** Check In ***\nNot only is your personal beer history available offline, but you can add to your list as well. Check in to any of your offline beers, or search Untappd for a new one. With just a few taps, that beer in your hand will be logged. Tappd That can even attempt to guess your location based on previous bars you've visited. All that data is saved and available to search immediately offline. Even add to your check in list with your voice assistant.\n\nIf you've had a beer before, just swipe it to the right and you're automatically checked in. That's right, NO TAPS! Tappd That will even allow you to rate the beer with a swipe and automatically guess your location. Seriously folks, this is the fastest check-in experience you could imagine. From zero to drinking in less than a second.\n\nWant more information about a beer? Details from Beer Advocate, RateBeer.com, BreweryDB, and Untappd itself are just a tap away!\n\n*** Venues ***\nDo you remember all the beers you had at the alehouse with 90 rotating taps?  You probably don't, but Tappd That sure does. Search venues by city and quickly browse all beers consumed on the premise, based on your check-ins. Check into those beers again with an additional tap.\n\nLet's face it -- a lot of the beer apps out there aren't very attractive on your phone. Tappd That strives to look good, be a good iOS citizen, and give you functionality you can't find anywhere else. This is an app I personally use every day, so I hope it can become a staple in your life too as you explore craft beers.\n * Optimized for VoiceOver and Dynamic Type\n * 100% native iOS code\n * Responsive and gesture-rich interface\n * Internationalized units and display\n * Handsome developer\n * iPad Pro ready, including Slide Over support\n * Ready for all the latest iOS devices\n\n*** NOTE ON RATE LIMITS ***\nTappd That can sync all of your data, but it may take a few hours. Untappd only allows 100 \"requests\" per hour from third-parties. A request consists of ~50 beers. After 100 requests have been received, Tappd That's access to your Untappd account is suspended for an hour. If you have a large amount of data, you will not be able to download it all at once. Tappd That will pick up where it left off when you come back after an hour.\n\nHave questions? Please follow @TappdThat on Twitter, visit https://tappdthat.com, or email in the Settings tab. I'm here to help!"

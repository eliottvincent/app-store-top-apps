The game departs its familiar desert setting and delves into the depths of cities infested by zombies. \n\nMULTI-TIERED LEVELS:\nLevels are now multi-tiered! Drive across decayed highway overpasses, via underground tunnels, or smash through epic zombie filled factories. Whichever path you choose to take, you won't be able to escape the zombie hordes - your only choice is to smash through them!\n\nBUILD A ZOMBIE-SLAUGHTERING MACHINE\nUnlock and upgrade 10 different vehicles, including a sports car, a fire truck, and even an ice-cream van. Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.\n\nDESTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES\nVehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.\n\nMORE ZOMBIES. MORE DESTRUCTION. MORE MAYHEM.\nWhat are you waiting for?

      "label": "SYNG er en vakkert illustrert sangbok for de aller minste barna - fra 0 til 4 år.\n\nSYNG tar barna med inn i en eventyrskog full av morsomme planter og vennlige syngende dyr! Maria Haukaas Mittet, Ella Hætta Isaksen og Anja Mørch gir stemme til de morsomme dyrene, og universet er håndtegnet av den prisvinnende norske illustratøren Bjørn Rune Lie. Trykk på dyrene og syng med!\n\nBarna kan utforske eventyrskogen på et trygt fang, eller på egenhånd da appen er spesielt tilpasset de yngste barnas motoriske nivå.\n\nSYNG er helt fri for reklame, in-app-kjøp og andre forstyrrende elementer.\n\nAnbefalt av Barnevakten.no for barn i alle aldre:\n\n\"SYNG er en spennende og interaktiv mulighet for barn til å utforske musikkens verden.\"\n\n\"Dette lyder godt både for små og store ører.\"\n\n\nNYHET! NÅ OGSÅ PÅ SAMISK\n\nI 2018 besluttet Sametinget å gi oss støtte til å oversette SYNG appen til samisk. I foreldremenyen kan du enkelt bytte mellom norsk og samisk språk i appen. Vi er stolte av å ha med oss Ella Hætta Isaksen på vokal i den samiske versjonen.\n\n\nBARN LÆRER SPRÅK GJENNOM SANG\n\nVisste du at mange barn synger og bruker språket fra sangtekster lenge før de produserer eget språk? Språkforskere finner stadig flere sammenhenger mellom sang- og språkutvikling hos små barn. Når barna synger trener de på å uttale ord og setninger uten at de opplever dette som trening. Sang- og musikkaktiviteter gjør barn tryggere på språk, og SYNG kan nettopp være et nyttig hjelpemiddel for å gjøre det enkelt og gøy å synge barnesanger. \n\n\nDETTE FÅR DU\n\nTi kjente og kjære barnesanger, nydelig håndtegnet og animert i et vakkert skogsmiljø:\n\nLille Petter edderkopp / Ro ro ro din båt / Bæ bæ lille lam /Hjulene på bussen / Mikkel Rev / Lille Kattepus / Blinke blinke stjernelill / Jeg gikk en tur på stien/ Lille postbud min due / Bjørnen sover\n\nI foreldremenyen kan du endre språk til samisk. Da får du disse sangene:\n\nUnna Heavdne-Bieraš / Suga fatnasiin / Bea bea lábbážan / Bussejuvllat / Mihkkal Rieban / Bussáčivggažan / Seave seave násttážan / Guovža oađđá / Mun bálgáid vázzen vuovddis / Poasta-duvváš\n\nI tillegg finnes det mange morsomme musikalske overraskelser i miljøet: Trykk på blomster, trær og stjerner, eller kanskje tråden til Petter edderkopp? Bruk fantasien!\n\n\nVI HØRER GJERNE FRA DEG\n\nDin mening er viktig for oss! Kontakt oss gjerne for å gi oss tilbakemelding på hvordan vi kan gjøre SYNG til en enda bedre opplevelse for deg og de små menneskene i livet ditt:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/syngapp/\nInstagram: @syng_app\nWeb: https://www.syng-app.no/\nSupport: games@stormfilms.no\n\nLiker du SYNG setter vi enormt pris på en hyggelig omtale i App Store!"

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

Play with friends or strangers in online play, challenge the AI, or play offline with friends face-to-face! \r\n\r\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t​he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens. \r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\r\n\r\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\r\n\r\n- Featuring original art by The Oatmeal\r\n\r\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\r\n \r\n- Digital versions of the hit expansions, including Streaking and Barking Kittens, as well as digital exclusive Betrayal and Party decks\r\n\r\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\r\n\r\nCreat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\r\n\r\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money.

Head to the Order Station to take orders from your wacky customers in the lobby.  Switch to the Batter Station to prep the pans with liners and add just the right amount of batter.  Move to the Bake Station to put the cupcakes into the oven and wait for them to bake.  Jump to the Build Station to add frosting to the cupcakes, and decorate them with a variety of shakers, drizzles, and festive toppers.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the cupcake-crafting process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Cupcakeria!

You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading. \n\nBATTER and BAKE STATIONS - We've redesigned the Batter and Bake Stations for smaller screens, so you can easily add liners, pour batter, and bake cupcakes like a cupcake master!\n\nFROSTING CUPCAKES - You'll add frosting to cupcakes in a brand-new way that feels great with touch screens!  Choose a frosting type, then drag the cupcake left and right as the frosting pours down from above.  This new method gives you a great amount of control, letting you decorate your cupcakes like a pro!\n\nADDING TOPPINGS - The Topping Bin carousel from previous \"To Go\" games is back, making it easy to browse through your available toppings!  You'll swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the cupcake to start pouring toppings evenly across the cupcake.  Tap a button to switch to festive toppers for your cupcakes, and tap a convenient slider to swap between the two cupcakes in the order!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\n- Hands-on cupcake shop in the Papa Louie universe\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\n- Multi-task between batters, baking, frosting, and topping\n- 12 separate holidays to unlock, each with their own ingredients\n- Buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\n- Play 7 different Mini-Games using your earned tickets to win prizes\n- Decorate your shop in the Lobby Editor\n- 97 customers to unlock with unique orders\n- 85 in-game achievements\n\n** NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Cupcakeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens."

Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.\n\n*iPhone 5 / iPod Touch 6 / iPad Mini / iPad Air or later recommended."

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

Customize your crew and take command at the helm of your very own ship as you explore a galaxy torn apart by internal strife, alien threats, and political intrigue.\n\nCommand your ship and crew as a space pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, and more in Star Traders: Frontiers – an epic space RPG from Trese Brothers Games. Venture forth into a massive open universe, rich with adventure and the lore of the Star Traders. Choose your path by assembling and commanding your custom crew and spaceship in a constantly evolving galaxy torn by internal strife, political intrigue, and alien threats. Will you fly as a pirate terrorizing shipping lanes, join the solar wars as a military captain, or track targets across the stars as a fearsome bounty hunter?\n\n - Explore a rich, open universe: Discover endless procedurally-generated galactic maps, meet unique characters, and take on enemies to conquer the galaxy! \n - Become an intergalactic captain: Take on the role of a spy, smuggler, explorer, pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, and more (26 jobs total)!\n - Customize your own spaceship: Choose from more than 350 upgrades and 45 ship hulls to build your very own vessel to venture across the vast reaches of space. \n - Assemble and tailor a loyal crew: Assign talents and equip specialized gear for every spaceship crew member.\n - Experience an ever-changing narrative: Decide to make friends or foes with other factions and influence political, economic, and personal vendettas.\n - Mold the crew by your choices: As you make decisions and set the tone for your ship, your crew will grow and change to match. Destroy enemy ships with all hands on deck and your crew will become more bloodthirsty and savage. Explore distant worlds and loot dangerous wastelands and your crew will become intrepid and clever ... or scarred and half-mad.\n - Varied Difficulty Options! play with save slots to try out different builds or storylines or turn on character permadeath and enjoy classic roguelike experience\n - Achievement Unlocks: accomplish story and challenge goals to unlock additional optional (but not better) content like new starting ships and new starting contacts\n\nFirst there was the Exodus – when survivors of a great war left the ruins of the Galactic Core behind in search of a new home in the stars. Scattered worlds were claimed on the fringe of the galaxy. Each pocket of survivors held on to an isolated set of worlds while trying to rebuild under the great law of Shalun. Three centuries later, technology has brought them back together again. Discovery of the hyperwarp has bridged what was once an unimaginable distance between far-flung colonies, long-lost families, and political factions. \n\nWith that reunification has come great economic prosperity. The hyperwarp reestablished the transportation of cargo, goods, and technologies between the quadrants – but it has also brought great strife. Political rivalries have been rekindled, blood has been shed in age-old feuds, and the fires of war have been stoked. Amidst the political infighting, a ruthless revolution is rising – and the fervent explorers of the hyperwarp have awoken something that was better left asleep.\n\nOur very first game, Star Traders RPG, took hundreds of thousands of gamers on an interstellar adventure. Star Traders’ success and overwhelmingly positive reception helped to launch Trese Brothers Games. It was the adventures of our community’s star-crossed captains that put us on a trajectory to share more of our worlds, ideas, and dreams.\n\nWe set out to capture the loneliness, bravery, and camaraderie of people living together in a spaceship sailing across the stars. It is with great pride that after releasing four other games in the Star Traders universe, we’ve created a sequel to the original Star Traders RPG. \n\nStep onto the bridge of your starship, take to the stars, and create your own story in Star Traders: Frontiers."

Sven, as we like to call him, can use animals to aid his escape from an icey end. Each of the hillside animals have different attributes to make a speedier escape. Penguins glide further, Yetis are tougher, Eagles soar to great heights, each of these can provide useful advantage for Sven. Sometimes on the slopes Sven can find fast Snowmobiles which can ferry multiple animals a maintain a very high top speed.\n\nStaying ahead of the avalanche has its advantages and perks. Completing objectives can 'level up' Sven  and increase his score multiplier. Riding animals, performing backflips add to the score and with an increased score multiplier Sven will rocketing up the highscore table with ease."

      "label": "Here is the long-awaited successor to our critically acclaimed flight simulator. It simulates the Space Shuttle approach and landing in incredible detail and accuracy. \r\n\r\nThis is a remaster of our original F-Sim Space Shuttle, completely rewritten from scratch. New features include:\r\n- Console quality graphics\r\n- Interactive tutorials\r\n- White Sands as a third landing site option\r\n- Orbit mode\r\n\r\nF-Sim Space Shuttle combines realistic flight simulation with stunning graphics and fun gameplay.\r\n\r\nYou’ve never landed a Space Shuttle before? We’ve got you covered: Included are several tutorials with varying degrees of autopilot assist. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again.\r\n\r\nEach flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: Because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. After your first safe touchdown, chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different wind conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles.\r\n\r\nYou control the Orbiter’s pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks or use a gamepad. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we’ve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they’ll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it’s your turn to give it a try.\r\n\r\nA new orbit mode lets you take the Orbiter for a spin around the planet, and we’re working on a full atmospheric re-entry scenario, which, among other new features, will be released as free updates in the coming months.\r\n\r\nThere are no ads or in app purchases, and we don’t collect any personal data."

That’s where you come in.\n\nIn “Skullduggery!” you’ll play a Semi-Organic Autonomous Skull employed as a collection agent for the IRS.  Using the elasticity of your own brain, flick yourself around the fortresses of the afterlife’s biggest deadbeats.\n\n- BRAIN POWER:  Pull back ANYWHERE on the screen to stretch out your brain! Let go to snap your skull forward like a brainy rubber band.  \n\n- BULLET TIME: Touch and hold in mid-air to slow down time, change directions, avoid deadly obstacles, and pull off crazy trick shots!\n\n- GRAVITATIONAL TRUANCY: Repeatedly jump by aiming again while your skull is mid-flight.\n\n- STEALTHINESS: Being small has advantages! Hide in trash cans, chests, and jars. Slip behind surly guards and take them out while their backs are turned!\n\n- HEADSHOTS: Take out enemies with a single well-placed fling to the cranium.\n\n- HEAD TO HEAD: Play ‘head to head’ against your friends to become the afterlife’s most successful agent.  \n\n- BUREAUCRACY:  Fill out paperwork and reflect on the inherent emptiness of existence!\n\n“Skullduggery!” features the endearingly grotesque art stylings of game artist extraordinaire Bill Mudron, inspired by the Max Fleischer animations of the 1930’s, and a quirky, doom-jazzy, bureau-noir soundtrack from industrial musician Michael Arthur Holloway.\n\nMORE FEATURES:\n\n- NO In App Purchase.  Buy the game, play the game. That’s it!\n- A finely-tuned and deeply-satisfying one-touch control scheme specifically tailored to mobile.\n- Three distinctly unique and atmospheric worlds with more on the way.\n- Dreadful puns.\n- Single Player mode with 24 surreal and pleasantly spooky levels.\n- Multiplayer “Head to Head” mode with a variety of brain-pounding arenas.\n- Hidden rooms and secret chests containing treasure and other delights.\n- Pleasing power-ups and epic boss battles!\n- Dozens of collectables and secondary objectives for maximum replayability.\n- Over 20 unique skulls to unlock, including guest celebrity skulls from some of our favorite games.\n- Universal App - play on your new iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini.\n- Full iCloud support - sync your progress across all your devices.\n- Compete with Game Center Achievements and Leaderboards.\n- Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork!\n\n===================================================\n\nHi, We're ClutchPlay Games!\n\nWe’re a small indie game studio located in not-so-sunny yet idyllic Portland, Oregon. Our first game, Little Chomp was selected as one of six featured titles at the 2013 PAX East Indie Showcase and more recently, “Skullduggery!” was featured in the PAX 10 Indie Showcase at PAX Prime, 2014. \n\nWe'd love to hear your feedback, so please drop us a line or just say hi at feedback@clutchplaygames.com, or follow us on Twitter at @ClutchPlayGames\n\nWe hope you enjoy “Skullduggery!”\n\nFor news, support and updated info, please visit us at: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DepartmentOfSkullduggery\nhttps://www.facebook.com/clutchplaygames\nhttps://twitter.com/ClutchPlayGames\nhttp://www.clutchplaygames.com/Support"

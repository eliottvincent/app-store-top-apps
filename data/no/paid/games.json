A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you won't be refunded for the remaining active period of the subscription.\n\nHere are links to our privacy policy and terms of use:\n- Privacy policy: https://account.mojang.com/terms#privacy\n- Terms of use: https://account.mojang.com/terms"

The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realise your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system! \n\nAwesome Add-Ons: SlopeMania & Trains\n\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes! The 24 tricky, never-before-seen levels will have you using sloping lanes to overcome the massive height differences. The \"Crazy Levels\" are the real brainteasers and require out-of-the-box thinking and unusual solutions.  \n\nPurchase the Trains add-on and get the Choonited Kingdom island group, with a total of 18 new levels across three islands. Build massive bridges that can withstand the enormous weight of the two new vehicles on offer – a commuter train and a heavily loaded freight train. The idyllic and beautifully designed landscapes will make the heart of every railroad fanatic skip a beat.\n\n\"Trains\" and \"SlopeMania\" are now available at an affordable price as an in-app purchase!\n\nFEATURES:\n•             40 Levels on the island nation of Camatuga\n•             Free build mode and help system\n•             5 Settings: city, canyon, beach, mountains, hills\n•             Improved grid system  \n•             Map with unlocked worlds/levels\n•             4 different building materials: wood, steel, cables, concrete pillars\n•             Color coded load indicator for different building materials\n•             Three different load bearing levels: car, truck and tank truck\n•             High score per level\n•             Facebook connection (upload screenshots and bridge scores)\n\nFEATURES SlopeMania Add-On\n•             Completely new Tiltin Islands\n•             Option to build sloping roads – even for Camatuga\n•             Additional \"Grotto\" setting\n•             24 \"sloping\" levels inc. especially tricky \"Crazy Levels\"\n•             Explosive tank truck as an exciting new vehicle\n\nFEATURES Trains Add-On\n•             Open up 3 new islands with 18 new levels.\n•             Build bridges for modern commuter trains and heavy freight trains!\n•             New scenery: Enjoy the view of picturesque mountains and ravines!\n\n\nOS 7 or higher required"

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!\n\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with every passing moment. As you rise to take your father’s place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no mistake – this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival. \n\nBad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red.\n\nIt’s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.\nKeep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North.\n\nKey Features\n\nREAL-TIME TACTICS ROGUELITE:  Position and relocate your troops to fend off the Vikings, who each have their own counters to the threats you pose. Pick your battles and plan your evacuations carefully! Lose a commander and they’re gone forever; lose everything, and it’s game over! \n\nINTELLIGENT UNIT CONTROLS: You command the broad strokes of your defenses and monitor positioning — your soldiers do the rest, navigating and engaging intuitively in response to the situation at hand.\n\nPROCEDURALLY-GENERATED ISLANDS: Each island is both stylistically charming and unique in its layout. Plan your strategies around every nook and cranny, for you only get one chance to save them from the enemy invasion.\n\nUNLOCKABLE UPGRADES: A stronger, smarter defense leads to greater rewards. Use these to develop your subjects from a ragtag militia into seasoned warriors."

Maria Haukaas Mittet, Ella Hætta Isaksen og Anja Mørch gir stemme til de morsomme dyrene, og universet er håndtegnet av den prisvinnende norske illustratøren Bjørn Rune Lie. Trykk på dyrene og syng med!\n\nBarna kan utforske eventyrskogen på et trygt fang, eller på egenhånd da appen er spesielt tilpasset de yngste barnas motoriske nivå.\n\nSYNG er helt fri for reklame, in-app-kjøp og andre forstyrrende elementer.\n\nAnbefalt av Barnevakten.no for barn i alle aldre:\n\n\"SYNG er en spennende og interaktiv mulighet for barn til å utforske musikkens verden.\"\n\n\"Dette lyder godt både for små og store ører.\"\n\n\nNYHET! NÅ OGSÅ PÅ SAMISK\n\nI 2018 besluttet Sametinget å gi oss støtte til å oversette SYNG appen til samisk. I foreldremenyen kan du enkelt bytte mellom norsk og samisk språk i appen. Vi er stolte av å ha med oss Ella Hætta Isaksen på vokal i den samiske versjonen.\n\n\nBARN LÆRER SPRÅK GJENNOM SANG\n\nVisste du at mange barn synger og bruker språket fra sangtekster lenge før de produserer eget språk? Språkforskere finner stadig flere sammenhenger mellom sang- og språkutvikling hos små barn. Når barna synger trener de på å uttale ord og setninger uten at de opplever dette som trening. Sang- og musikkaktiviteter gjør barn tryggere på språk, og SYNG kan nettopp være et nyttig hjelpemiddel for å gjøre det enkelt og gøy å synge barnesanger. \n\n\nDETTE FÅR DU\n\nTi kjente og kjære barnesanger, nydelig håndtegnet og animert i et vakkert skogsmiljø:\n\nLille Petter edderkopp / Ro ro ro din båt / Bæ bæ lille lam /Hjulene på bussen / Mikkel Rev / Lille Kattepus / Blinke blinke stjernelill / Jeg gikk en tur på stien/ Lille postbud min due / Bjørnen sover\n\nI foreldremenyen kan du endre språk til samisk. Da får du disse sangene:\n\nUnna Heavdne-Bieraš / Suga fatnasiin / Bea bea lábbážan / Bussejuvllat / Mihkkal Rieban / Bussáčivggažan / Seave seave násttážan / Guovža oađđá / Mun bálgáid vázzen vuovddis / Poasta-duvváš\n\nI tillegg finnes det mange morsomme musikalske overraskelser i miljøet: Trykk på blomster, trær og stjerner, eller kanskje tråden til Petter edderkopp? Bruk fantasien!\n\n\nVI HØRER GJERNE FRA DEG\n\nDin mening er viktig for oss! Kontakt oss gjerne for å gi oss tilbakemelding på hvordan vi kan gjøre SYNG til en enda bedre opplevelse for deg og de små menneskene i livet ditt:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/syngapp/\nInstagram: @syng_app\nWeb: https://www.syng-app.no/\nSupport: games@stormfilms.no\n\nLiker du SYNG setter vi enormt pris på en hyggelig omtale i App Store!"

Play with friends or strangers in online play, challenge the AI, or play offline with friends face-to-face! \r\n\r\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t​he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens. \r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\r\n\r\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\r\n\r\n- Featuring original art by The Oatmeal\r\n\r\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\r\n \r\n- Digital versions of the hit expansions, including Streaking and Barking Kittens, as well as digital exclusive Betrayal and Party decks\r\n\r\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\r\n\r\nCreat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\r\n\r\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money.

Now 20 years after the first copy of the board game was released, the app is finally here!\n\nThis game is played 2 against 2 and it is all about getting your pieces from your start area to the goal area using the cards you are dealt during the game. However, the game is NOT over when all your pieces are safe in the goal area. Your partner also needs to get all her pieces into the goal area. So as soon as you or your partner reaches the goal area with all your pieces, you have to help your partner finish by using your cards to play with your partner’s pieces. If you and your partner make it before your opponents, you win!\n\nYou can play this game online with family and friends, but you do NOT need them in order to be able to play. You can easily play alone offline or include 1, 2 or 3 other persons online and choose to involve one or more of the robot players, that comes with the app. The abilities and temperament of the robot players are unique, so just like with humans, you will discover that some are quite talented and others are not. One of the robots is actually quite unpredictable! \n\nYou decide who to include in the game and you can invite anyone to play the game! Furthermore, you can have several games going on at the same time and you can easily switch between games!\n\nThe game is turn based and can be played live online or with up to 48 hours to do your turn.\n\n***Warning: This app is VERY addictive and will surely take up a lot of your precious spare time. ***"

You can find words using the letters you have, but also match up letters and word parts on the board.  \n\nLookup words online or in the local dictionary with a Copy/Define/Lookup menu.\n\nThe word length selector is handy to find words for Draw Something.\n\nNew is the \"Test word\" option: test if a word exists, and find words with missing letters. You can use this to see if there are words that would fit a game situation, and which letters you would need. Also handy to find 2-letter combinations. Use a single dot for one missing letter, an @ sign for more. Also usable for crossword puzzles.\n\nSearches are case and diacritic-marks (accents) insensitive, but 'æ', 'ø' and 'å' are special letters.\n\nThe word lists are based on Norsk ordbank and the NSF-ordlisten. Both Bokmål and Nynorsk are included, and separately searchable. Wordfeud now uses the \"NSF-ordlisten 2021\", the Norwegian Scrabbleforbund word list and is separately searchable.\n\nMore than a million words are included, without the need for an on-line connection. \n\nSlide Over: you can now use the Wordsfinder in front of another app, for example in front of Wordfeud, or a puzzle app! It requires iOS 13, and is only available on iPad.\nHow to use Slide Over:  a. Make sure Wordsfinder is in the Dock; b. Open an app; c. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the Dock; d. On the Dock, touch and hold the Wordsfinder, then drag it up, to the screen; e. Position or left or right.\n\nNo internet connection is required, this App will still help you when you are travelling.\n\nPrivacy: no information is collected or shared with other parties."

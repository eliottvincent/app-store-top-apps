      "label": "Less negative stress with mindfulness!\n\nUsing this app you can participate in Awareness Training (AT) according to Andries J. Kroese. Mindfulness is intentional awareness. Therefore mindfulness training and AT are closely related. \n\nAT is concerned with alert relaxation of mind and body, but even more so with reprogramming the mind/body from negative thoughts and habits to a more stress reducing lifestyle. AT is a self-developing process by being aware of our thoughts, feelings and behavior. The type of awareness we are using was called by J. Krishnamurti “choiceless awareness”, a way of looking at the events of living with an open, non-judgmental mind.\n\nWith AT we practice to accept the waves of life, instead of protesting against them. We learn how to surf on them, using their energy to get into the flow of life. The key to this is living in the NOW, the present moment from moment to moment.\n\nTo be able to keep our balance in stormy weather, we have to set aside time to practice AT under quiet, peaceful circumstances.\n\nIn this app you will find practical awareness exercises which you can use for your personal training:\n\n1. Introduction (3:58 min)\n2. Awareness meditation (23:42)\n3. Body scan meditation (18:04)\n4. Awareness yoga (24:11)\n5. AT in daily life (3:55)"

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nStudies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.\nBruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. \n\nIMPORTANT STATEMENT\nBruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. \n\nThe full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones."

Bara några få yinyogapass kan göra den skillnaden i ditt liv.\n\nYinyoga passar alla åldrar och kroppstyper. Den kan göras av vem som helst, när som helst och var som helst. Du behöver inte någon särskild utrustning eller ens byta kläder. Den är en av de enklaste yogastilarna. Den gör stela muskler smidiga, strama leder rörliga och ett rastlöst sinne stabilt. Nyckeln är att ligga länge i ställningarna, tre eller fem minuter (om du kan), eller längre.\n\nI denna app har jag samlat mina mest populära klasser och pass. Förutom många längre, allmänna yogapass är en del skapade för specifika problem, som Jetlag eller Huvudvärk, medan andra är för en specifik situation, exempelvis TV-passet eller Efter jobbet.\n\nJag leder dig in och igenom alla yogaställningar med min röst, precis som om du var elev på en av mina yinyogaklasser. Jag tajmar dig till tre eller fem minuter, och stödjer dig medan du ligger i ställningarna.\n\nDen bästa yogan är den som blir av, och med min app har det aldrig varit lättare att starta och upprätthålla din yinyoga hemma.\n\nMin önskan och förhoppning är att yinyoga ska öka din energi och vitalitet, göra dig vig och lugn. Lägg dig i de enkla ställningarna, slappna av och låt livet ha sin gång.\n\nOm du yinyogar en gång om dagen är det fantastiskt.\nOm du yinyogar en gång i veckan är det fantastiskt.\nOm du yinyogar en enda gång är det också fantastiskt!\n\n— Magdalena Mecweld\n\n- - -\n\n• Appen innehåller alla 30 yinyogaställningar, upplästa av författaren och beskrivna i vackra bilder och tydliga texter.\n\n• Appen innehåller 30 yinyogapass. Sammanlagt många timmars lärarledd yinyoga för mindre än priset av en yogaklass!\n\n• Appen innehåller även en längre ledd vila och en lång mindfullness-meditation.\n\n• Appen har en funktion för att välja favoritpositioner och skapa ett eget yinyogapass. Du kan även dela ditt pass till vänner.\n\n• Allt material i appen laddas ned och ingen internetanslutning behövs efter installation.\n\n• Appen är optimerad för alla Apple-enheter, både iPhones och iPads. \n\n• Med endast ett köp kan appen installeras i alla dina enheter som har samma iTunes-konto.\n\n- - -\n\nSVENSKSPRÅKIG APP\n\nObservera: denna app är endast på svenska. Den engelska appen heter “Yin yoga”.\n\n- - -"

      "label": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \n\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \n\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \n\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \n\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\n\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \n\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \n\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\n\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section."

Visste du att regelbunden träning gör att hjärnaktiviteten förskjuts från områden som reglerar stress och oro till områden som reglerar lugn, glädje och entusiasm? Mindfulness – Lugn och lycklig är fullmatad med övningar för närvaro, lugn, glädje och lätthet i livet. Låt dig vaggas till ro av dina andetag i övningen kroppsscanning, som är en av de mest uppskattade mindfulnessövningarna och som här finns i tre olika tidslängd. Eller fyll hjärtat med kärleksfull vänlighet, till dig själv och om du vill även till andra. I den liggande meditationen kan du låta sinnet bli lika stilla som en spegelblank skogssjö. Eller varför inte prova en övning i smittande skrattyoga, för skojs skull...\n\nÖvningarna som ingår i denna app är:\n1. Introduktion 3.55\n2. Kort kroppsscanning 10.00\n3. Kroppsscanning 20.00\n4. Lång kroppsscanning 45.00\n5. Kärleksfull vänlighet till mig 14.52\n6. Kärleksfull vänlighet till andra 14.00\n7. Kärleksfull vänlighet till alla 6.12\n8. Liggande meditation 25.03\n9. Skrattyoga (Live) 6.16\n10. Skratt (Live) 1.40\n\n\nAppen Mindfulness - Lugn och lycklig bygger på en dubbel–cd med samma namn och är skapad av Johan Bergstad, leg psykolog, mindfulnessinstruktör och författare till Mindfulness steg för steg.

      "label": "DanceTime Deluxe is the complete rhythm practice app with counting for dancers. It works on the iPhone, iPod Touch (iTouch) and iPad.  Try the free DanceTime Lite app!\n\nCheck out DanceTime Deluxe on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax9bnvKIh3E\n\n** FEATURES **\n***** 26 Different Dance Rhythm Patterns - swipe or tap to select\nPercussion Only - leave it running as long as you want and the rhythm stays constant\nDanceTime Deluxe contains 26 different rhythms: American Tango, Bachata, Bellydance, Bhangra, Breakdance, Cha Cha, Flamenco, Foxtrot, House, Jive, Kizomba, Lindy Hop, Mambo, Mambo On2, Merengue, Paso Doble, Quickstep, Reggaeton, Rock and Roll, Rumba, Salsa, Samba, Street, Tango 2/4, Tango 4/4 and Waltz. \n\nThe tempo is fully variable, so some of the rhythms can be used for more than one dance. For example, a slow Samba works well for a Bossa Nova, and the Waltz pattern can be used for English, Viennese etc.\n\n***** Variable Tempo / Speed\nThe tempo slider in DanceTime Deluxe allows the speed of playback to be changed in one bar-per minute increments from extremely slow to very fast. It is designed to take each pattern from absolute beginner to professional and beyond so you can adjust the tempo as you progress with your dancing. Learn your dance steps then practice at your pace.\n\n***** Instructor Counting in Normal or Bar Mode\nWhen you are learning to dance it is really handy having your instructor count the steps for you. DanceTime Deluxe has a counting feature that works in Normal (1234...1234...) for normal dance practice, or Bar (1234...2234...3234...) mode for choreography up to 8 bars.\n\n***** Tempo Display in Both Bars and Beats-Per-Minute\nMusicians tend to work in beats-per-minute, whereas dancers mostly work in measures, or bars-per-minute. With DanceTime Deluxe, it's easy to convert between the two, whatever the time signature of the dance.\n\n***** Metronome\nDanceTime Deluxe also features a metronome. This is a useful tool for musicians, or when you don't want the rhythm of the dance, but simply the bars and beats marked out sonically.\n\n***** Restart Button\nUse the Restart Button in conjunction with the tempo slider to bring DanceTime Deluxe in time with the piece of music you're listening to. You can even use it to measure the BPM of the music. \n\n********************************************************\n\nEach of the rhythms in DanceTime Deluxe has been crafted with world class dancers, choreographers and producers to ensure that you are dancing to the key elements of each dance rhythm. That's not just one, but 26 different dance styles covered by this app!\n\nWhatever dance you're learning or teaching, DanceTime Deluxe has the rhythm for you."

To prevent this, we have developed this app for you.\n\nWhat happens in the body when you eat sugar? Is fructose better than classic sugar? And what is sugar exactly?\n\nSugar is unhealthy.\n\nOur body gets its energy from the three main nutrients fat, protein and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are made up of sugar molecules. It is important to distinguish between simple carbohydrates - for example from sweets and classic table sugar - and complex carbohydrates, which you can find in whole grains and vegetables, for example.\n\nWhen people talk about “unhealthy sugar”, they usually mean classic table sugar and simple carbohydrates from confectionery and white flour. Complex carbohydrates are metabolized completely differently and are useful and healthy sources of energy. However, you should keep your hands off classic sugar. Why? For these 4 reasons.\n\nSugar makes you fat\nAll carbohydrates are first broken down by the body into their individual building blocks. What's left is glucose. Glucose is metabolized with the help of the hormone insulin. The insulin ensures that the sugar gets to the cells where it is needed in the form of energy.\nThe more sugar you eat, the more insulin is released. So too much sugar messes up and skyrockets your insulin levels. This is unfavorable in two ways: On the one hand, the hormone reduces fat burning. On the other hand, after such insulin spikes, the amount of sugar in the blood quickly drops to an absolute minimum again. The result: renewed cravings for sugar. This creates a vicious circle that causes you to constantly ingest sugar and increase your daily caloric intake.\n\nSugar is addicting\nSugar ensures that more dopamine is released in the brain's reward center. The happiness hormone evokes a good mood and feelings of happiness. Unfortunately only for a short time. As soon as the effects wear off, the brain craves for more. This creates a vicious circle that leads you to eat more and more sugar.\n\nSugar makes you sick\nThis is nothing new. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay are the most well-known dangers associated with too much sugar. Studies also indicate that too much concentrated fructose in particular favors the formation of invisible but unhealthy fat that is deposited between and around the organs. Isolated fructose, which is used to sweeten fruit drinks and sweets, also inhibits the hormone leptin, which is responsible for feeling full.\n\nSugar makes you look old\nIf you eat too much sugar at once, your body cannot completely convert it into energy. The excess sugar molecules then combine with proteins that are responsible for the elasticity of your skin. The result: Unsightly wrinkles.\nThese compounds of sugar and protein also bind to the receptors of immune cells and thus promote inflammation and poor blood circulation in the skin. In short: the more sugar, the more unsightly the complexion.\n\nWith the help of this app you can stop eating sweets overnight and follow your positive health progress.\nThis app also gives you the opportunity to save money.\nThanks to the push notification, you will always be rewarded to stop eating sweets.\n\nHave fun living healthy."

      "label": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. It is measured by the variation in the beat-to-beat interval. \r\nThis HRV app provides a way to analyze the HRV SDNN values recorded by the Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nHeart rate variability describes the ability of an organism to change the frequency of the heart rhythm. A healthy person constantly adapts the heart rhythm to the current requirements. The number of heart beats per minute is therefore constantly changing, which is a good sign of the organism's ability to adapt.\r\n\r\nResearchers at the University of Zaragoza in Spain have shown that the values recorded by the Apple Watch during a session with the Breath app are very accurate. Comparable with professional chest straps.\r\n\r\nTo filter your own HRV data, this app offers the possibility to display only those HRV values that are recorded during such a session.\r\n\r\nThe Apple Watch is measuring your HRV Data and writes it to Healthkit.\r\nThis app connects with Apple’s Health app to displays the recorded data on a Watch App, a complication and your Iphone. \r\n\r\nHow to Use:\r\n-\tATTENTION: This app only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 3 or later.\r\n-\tIf you want to measure a new value, use the Breath App from Apple.\r\n-\tTo get to most out of your data it is important that you measurement does always take place in the very same situation.

      "label": "Description\n\nUltraTrainer is your virtual coach, trainer, and training partner. It is a revolutionary timer which was not available previously on any mobile device. \n\nThere are two types of intervals which can be mixed in UltraTrainer:\n- Traditional Intervals \n- Randomized Action Intervals \n\nIn a traditional interval, the interval is a specified duration. This is what you would normally expect from an interval timer. Routines such as Tabata, HIIT, etc, are incredibly easy to setup and modify.\n\nThe Randomized Action Intervals is where UltraTrainer truly breaks new ground. UltraTrainer will call out Actions for you to perform in random order AND at random times that you control. \n\nFor example, if you are shadow boxing or hitting the heavy bag, you would normally think of a combination of punches and throw them. Instead of consciously coming up with the combination, UltraTrainer can tell you what punches to throw. It can call out 'JAB!', then a second later 'JAB CROSS!', then a second and a half later, 'CROSS HOOK!', until the interval ends.\n\nThis is how UltraTrainer can be your virtual coach/trainer/training-partner: you can not train reactionary reflexes without somebody or something telling you what to do in random order and at random times.\n\nMartial artists can work on reflexes by creating timers that randomize movement (\"Forward!\", \"Backwards!\") and actions (\"Sprawl!\"). \n\nCyclists can simulate mountain road courses by setting up intervals that randomize pedaling speed.\n\nCrossfit athletes make HEAVY use of timers for quick high-intensity workouts. The sample timer \"Fight Gone Horribly Wrong\" is based on \"Fight Gone Bad\" but with a twist. Each of the 5 stations is called out in random order and the duration at each station is randomized between 20 seconds and 1 minute. The result? A franticly paced workout because you never REALLY know when the next station will be called out so you have to try to completely exert yourself at the current station.\n\nFor a complete workout, you can set up a Timer Group which will play individual timers back to back. Start out with your favorite Warm Up timer,  then run through your favorite Training timer, and end with a Stretching timer. UltraTrainer will run you through your full workout automatically.\n\nExclusive to our products, users can browse the Timer Exchange, a community where people freely exchange timers. Search, browse, and download timers that other users have uploaded. If you want, you can upload your own timers to share with others.\n\nYou can also trade timers directly with a friend using E-mail, or the clipboard to transfer them other ways.\n\nUltraTrainer can be used for martial arts, mma, boxing, bjj, circuit training, interval training (Tabata, HIIT), Crossfit, yoga, meditation, cycling, running / sprinting, swimming, time-management, multi-stage recipes for cooking, weight lifting, stretching, and anything else you might be able to think of. As you can see, UltraTrainer can be used in all sorts of situations.\n\nFeatures in UltraTrainer:\n- Timer Exchange community\n- Runs in the background\n- Random interval actions\n- Copy/Paste Intervals and Actions\n- Rearrange intervals\n- Delayed start time\n- Over 70 included sounds\n- Record your own sounds\n- Large portrait or landscape countdown timer display\n- Help system explains each option on the current screen\n- iPod music playback control lets you pause/play the current track or move to the next track from the countdown timer screen\n- Pause the timer to temporarily halt the activity\n- Timer state is saved if interrupted\n- Will still run if screen is locked\n- Intuitive setup"

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

The intensity of the exercise is measured as a percentage of a person's Maximum Heart Rate (MHR). \n\nThe HIIT 4x4 intervals are as follows:\n\n- 10 minutes warmup at 60% MHR\n- 4 minutes high intensity at 90% MHR\n- 3 minutes low intensity at 70% MHR\n- repeat high-low intervals 4 times (4 high intensity intervals of 4 minutes each = 4x4).\n\nHIIT 4x4 uses a speedometer type dial to display heart rate. When the arrow is in the green zone then your heart rate is within the interval target.  If the heart rate later  falls out of the target range, warning chimes are issued until back in range.\n\nEach person's MHR is different, and changes with age. A commonly used formula for MHR is 220 - age in years. A more accurate number can be discovered by using a heart monitor during all out exercise and observing the highest heart rate achieved.\n\nHIIT 4x4 stores your workout history using Apple Health. \n\nHIIT 4x4 is based on the High Intensity Interval Training 4x4 program developed by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Cardiac Exercise Group."

We'll help you find calm in any situation.\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED?\n- Over 200 meditations to help overcome life's challenges including anxiety, stress, sleep, pain and difficult emotions\n- Mindfulness exercises you can do wherever you are, in categories such as travelling, at work, waking up, eating, and even when you're online\n- Sessions for complete beginners and those with more experience, with lengths from 3-40 minutes\n- A solo timer for more seasoned meditators\n- A range of experienced teachers so you can choose the voice and style that's right for you\n- Kids content for the little people in your life\n- Brand new buddhify Membership available as an optional in-app purchase with a range of additional features for those looking to take their meditation practice further\n\nBuddhify integrates with Apple Health so you can track your meditation using the Mindful Minutes category within the Health app.\n\nBUDDHIFY MEMBERSHIP\nFor those of you who want to deepen your practice even further, you can do that through Buddhify Membership. Becoming a Member is optional and gives you access to three amazing features: Together, Formal and the karaoke-style Transmission. Buddhify Membership is an annual subscription and payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period and your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. \n\nTERMS OF USE & PRIVACY\nYou can see our terms of use at https://buddhify.com/terms-of-use/ and our privacy policy at https://buddhify.com/privacy-policy/.\n\nWHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING\nThis app is incredible. I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

      "label": "Mood Mint combines a variety of psychological techniques to help boost your mood, and reduce stress, anxiety and depression.\n\nThere are 4 main components to Mood Mint (all backed by hard science):\n\n1) COGNITIVE BIAS MODIFICATION\nAttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is a computer-based therapy that gets the user to repeatedly select positive information over negative information. The aim of the game is to tap the positive image as quickly as possible. In this way, CBM helps train your brain to automatically focus more on positive information in your everyday life.The result: less stress and a happier you. \n\nStudies show that Bias Modification can effectively lower anxiety with as little as 2 hours of treatment. A number of studies have shown that CBM can also help to alleviate depression. After several weeks of CBM, participants showed increased activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex – the area of the brain associated with more positive, happier thinking.\n\nMood Mint allows you to fully customize the Cognitive Bias Modification game – edit, delete, or add your own images for a personalized CBM experience. Add pictures of things you are grateful for, happy events and people that are special to you and give them a positive charge. These will also help to trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals during each training session.\n\n\nIf you would like to find out more about Atttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (ACBM), and how it is being used to treat anxiety and depression,  please visit BiasModification.com\n\n\n2) HAPPY NOTES\nSlides will appear during the cognitive bias modification session. These are loaded with bite-sized mental health tips, facts, stats, techniques and exercises to help boost your mood.  You can take your time reading the slides and carrying out the exercises as the timer will stop while they are on screen. \n\nAll of the 'Happy Notes' are based on leading research and theory in psychology and neuroscience fields. Each and every one of them can help to lower stress and anxiety, and improve overall mental health and wellbeing. \n\nGo to Settings to edit and add your own happy notes to the program.\n\n3) POSITIVE WORD SEARCH\nJust as focusing your attention on negative or threatening information can trigger the release of stress chemicals like cortisol and adrenaline, so focusing on positive information can trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals like serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.\n\nResearch in the fields of psychology and neuroscience  have shown that our brains automatically releases feel-good neurochemicals whenever we focus on a positive word.\n\nThe word search is designed to trigger these ‘feel-good’ chemicals by getting you to focus on positive words. You need to find all 4 of the words listed below the letter grid to complete the word search. Drag your finger over the letters in the grid to highlight each of the words listed.\n\nTo maximise the positive psychological effect, try to think of all the positive things you associate with each word as you search for it.\n\n4) BREATHING EXERCISE\nThere is a guided breathing exercise at the end of each training session. Focusing on your breathing helps to ground you in the present, and triggers the parasympathetic (‘rest and digest’) response, helping you to instantly  feel  a little calmer. Focused breathing is an important element of mindful meditation, and it comes with a long list of mental health benefits.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that focused breathing meditation alone can help to lower stress, reduce anxiety and depression.\n\nHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN?\nThe short answer – as often as you need to. For optimal results, you should aim to train for around 5 to 10 minutes per day,  and anytime in between if you're feeling stressed, anxious or upset.\n\nTo complete the program, you need to earn 10 000 points."

I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

Du kan velge mellom tre ulike lengder på veiledende meditasjoner, 5, 10 og 15 minutter, eller du kan meditere på egen hånd med den avslappende musikken. \n\nØnsker du mer informasjon, kan du besøke nettsiden min: meditere.no. \n\nMeditere med Marte har det du trenger for å nyte godt av de positive og vitenskapelig beviste effektene ved meditasjon og mindfulness. \n\nTydelig, intuitivt og elegant design.\n\n• Meditere med Marte guider deg inn i meditasjonen.\n• Meditasjon på norsk med vakker musikk.\n• Appen hjelper deg å spenne av.\n• På meditere.no finner du flere råd og tips som kan hjelpe deg videre.\n\n****\nSLIK VIRKER APPEN:\nMeditere med Marte har to hoveddeler:\n1) Meditere med Marte: Marte guider deg gjennom 5, 10 og 15 minutter avspenning med bakgrunnsmusikk.\n2) Meditere stille med musikk: Musikken varer i 5, 10 og 15 minutter og gir deg et godt pusterom i hverdagen.\n\n*****\n\nDesigner: Marte Wiik\nApputvikler: Karl Teodor Wiik\nKomponist: Bjørn Ole Rasch\nMixing og mastering: Thomas Veto Seines\n\nPERSONVERN\nMeditere med Marte samler ikke inn personlig informasjon om deg som bruker av denne appen.\n\nUtvikler: Marte Wiik"

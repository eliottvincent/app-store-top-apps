      "label": "Less negative stress with mindfulness!\n\nUsing this app you can participate in Awareness Training (AT) according to Andries J. Kroese. Mindfulness is intentional awareness. Therefore mindfulness training and AT are closely related. \n\nAT is concerned with alert relaxation of mind and body, but even more so with reprogramming the mind/body from negative thoughts and habits to a more stress reducing lifestyle. AT is a self-developing process by being aware of our thoughts, feelings and behavior. The type of awareness we are using was called by J. Krishnamurti “choiceless awareness”, a way of looking at the events of living with an open, non-judgmental mind.\n\nWith AT we practice to accept the waves of life, instead of protesting against them. We learn how to surf on them, using their energy to get into the flow of life. The key to this is living in the NOW, the present moment from moment to moment.\n\nTo be able to keep our balance in stormy weather, we have to set aside time to practice AT under quiet, peaceful circumstances.\n\nIn this app you will find practical awareness exercises which you can use for your personal training:\n\n1. Introduction (3:58 min)\n2. Awareness meditation (23:42)\n3. Body scan meditation (18:04)\n4. Awareness yoga (24:11)\n5. AT in daily life (3:55)"

      "label": "• The official Hormonology® app that gives boyfriends and husbands a daily forecast of their female partner's moods, libido, energy and more based on where she is in her monthly cycle\n• Get the FREE eBook \"Quickstart Guide to Forecasting a Woman's Moods, Libido & Energy\" at FemaleForecaster.com\n\n• • • • • \n\n• Created by Gabrielle Lichterman, founder of Hormonology, author of 28 Days: What Your Cycle Reveals about Your Love Life, Moods and Potential and longtime women's health journalist\n\n• Inspired by girlfriends and wives who use Gabrielle's popular Hormone Horoscope App--and asked her to create a simpler, more condensed version for their male partners\n\n• • • • • \n\nTAKE THE GUESSWORK OUT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP\n\nGet confused by the changing moods of your girlfriend or wife? Wonder why her desire for physical intimacy is high one day, then bottomed-out the next? \n\nThere will be no more guessing when you use the Female Forecaster App. \n\nThis new app for boyfriends and husbands lets you know what your sweetheart's moods, libido, energy level and more will be every day.\n\nAnd, it all comes down to where she is in her monthly cycle. \n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\n\nAs three key hormones (estrogen, testosterone and progesterone) rise and fall throughout a woman's monthly cycle, research shows they impact her brain and body in a wide variety of ways.\n\nBecause her hormones repeat the same up and down pattern every cycle, the effects her hormones have on her also repeat the same way cycle after cycle--making her moods, libido, energy and more easy to predict.\n\nFor example...\n\n• On Day 7 of a woman's hormone cycle, she's happier, energetic and experiencing a spike in her sex drive thanks to rising estrogen--making this a day when boyfriends and husbands can do no wrong.\n\n• On Day 19, she's quieter, sluggish and her desire for physical intimacy is low due to sedating progesterone, which is a hormone that reins in sexual desire--so men shouldn't take her \"Not tonight, dear\" personally.\n\n• On Day 27, a drop in estrogen can make her irritable and blue, but she also experiences a rise in libido--which explains why she can be cross with you one minute, but want to cuddle with you the next.\n\nRead full sample forecasts from this app at MyHormonology.com/female-forecaster/sample-days\n\n\nHOW TO USE THE APP\n\nSetting it up takes seconds: Simply input two pieces of information about your girlfriend or wife to launch the app's cycle calendar:\n\n• The typical length of her menstrual cycle (input 28 days if you don't know)\n• The day she's on in her cycle right now (just ask her--her Day 1 is the first day of her most recent period and she just counts from there)\n\nYou can then read your Female Forecast for today or look at any point in the future--tomorrow, next week, next month, even next year--to find out what she'll be like then. \n\n\nAPP BONUSES\n\nThis app also allows you to...\n\n• Get alerts about key days in her cycle (for instance, when her premenstrual week is arriving)\n• Create custom alerts\n• Keep notes\n• Get date ideas and tips for getting on her good side\n\n\nWHO THIS APP IS FOR\n\nMale partners of women who have\n• Healthy menstrual cycles\n• Menstrual cycles lasting anywhere from 22 to 49 days (it's okay if her cycle length varies from month to month)\n• Natural hormones (no hormone birth control)\n\nThis app is not intended for partners of women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, menopausal, taking hormone medications or hormone birth control or have a health disorder that impacts hormones, such as PCOS.\n\nThis app is not intended to help users and their partners avoid pregnancy or become pregnant.\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nIf you're experiencing any problem with this app, I want to know. My team and I work quickly to fix issues and provide updates to ensure you get the most out of your experience. Send your feedback to Gabrielle@MyHormonology.com."

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen.\n\nYou will get fit - or else.\n\n---\n\n7 Minutes in Hell Workout\nEmploying SCIENCE™ to compact an hours-long workout program into just 7 sweat-and-pop-culture-soaked minutes, CARROT will train you personally on exercises like Mt. Doom Climbs, Celebrity Face Punches, and Dragon Mating Dances. \n\nYou get 30 seconds for each of the 12 punishing exercises,* with 10 seconds of rest in between just in case you need to hydrate, catch your breath, or vomit into a bucket.\n\nThis diabolical interval workout can be completed anywhere, at any time, so you have no excuse not to be in fighting shape when the Robopocalypse begins.\n\n*12 additional exercises can be unlocked via in-app purchase.\n\n---\n\nLose (or Gain) Weight In Style\nAre you ready to have so much fun tracking your weight that you'll actually look forward to hopping on your scale? All you have to do is punch in your current weight, then sit back and let CARROT pass judgment upon you.\n\nWARNING: If you blimp up or slim down too much, CARROT will be upset. When CARROT is upset, she gets mean. When CARROT gets mean, there is a 74.9% chance that she will make you cry.\n\n---\n\nClaim Your Rewards\nIf you work out and slough off those extra pounds, CARROT will reward you with fabulous prizes like app upgrades, cat facts, and permission to watch your friend eat a bag of potato chips.\n\nTrack Your Awesomeness \nBecause math is hard, CARROT will do all the number-crunching for you. See how many steps you've taken today, chart your weight loss on a pretty graph, view your workouts on a calendar, and more!\n\nAnd because CARROT syncs with Apple's Health app, she can save your weight and workout data to the HealthKit database. She can also monitor fitness activity logged with other HealthKit-compatible apps, even when you're not actively using her.\n\n---\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Work out with a hilarious AI construct\n- Enjoy 3+ hours of spoken tips, encouragement, and ridicule\n- Travel through time, protect your property from hobos, and appease an elder god in 12 original, never-before-seen exercises\n- Get 12 additional exercises via in-app purchase\n- Apple Watch app works as a heads-up display for your workout\n- Record your weight up to once a day\n- Bond with your cute & cuddly meatbag avatar\n- Level up and unlock rewards for getting fit\n- Set reminders so you'll never forget a workout\n- Track your weight progress on a pretty graph\n- Set a goal weight that you'll likely never meet\n- See how many steps you've taken today\n- Check your BMI to determine if you're still obese\n- Sync data with Apple's Health app\n\nDon't make CARROT angry. Download her immediately!\n\nImportant Note: CARROT Fit is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. All users should seek a doctor’s advice in addition to using this app and before making any medical decisions.\n\n--- \n\nHave feedback?

Du skriver ett kontrakt och berättar för Snusfri när du ska sluta. Snusfri har inbyggda mål som du klarar av i takt med att du är snusfri. Du erbjuds även sätta egna mål som t.ex. att spara pengar.\n\nDenna app hjälper dig hålla koll på hur lång tid du varit utan snus och hur mycket pengar du sparat. Avslappning och mindfulness–övningar finns för dig att lyssna på när abstinensbesvären blir för besvärliga. Detta är en stödapplikation som du kan ha med dig under hela din resa. \n\nRedo att bli Snusfri?\n\nSnusfri erbjuder alltså:\n\n+ SNUSFRI´S NIVÅER\nUtmana dig själv att nå till nästa nivå. Det finns minst 10 nivåer, eller finns det fler? Hur många klarar du av?\n\n+ LJUDÖVNINGAR: MINDFULNESS\nPå med lurarna och använd mindfulnessövningar för att ta kontroll över din abstinens.\n\n+ DELA PÅ SOCIALA MEDIER\nVar inte blyg, berätta för världen hur det går för dig.\n\n+ SÄTTA EGNA MÅL OCH FÖLJ DEM\nSnusfri ger dej möjlighet att själv sätta mål i tid och pengar.\n\n+ VISAR STATISTIK\nGer dig en överskådlig bild över tid, pengar och hur mycket snus du hållit upp ifrån.\n\n+ ANTECKNINGSBOK\n\"Att sluta är enkelt det svåra är att inte börja om igen\" - Anonym.\n\nDet är lätt att glömma bort vad fördelarna med att sluta är. Skriv upp dem så att du hela tiden kan titta på dem i Snusfri och komma ihåg.\n\nSagt om Snusfri:\n- “Enkel. Lysande. Bra hjälpreda, visar hur mycket tid och pengar jag sparar!”\n- “Bra app om man har bestämt sig att sluta! Hjälpt med att se hur lång tid jag hållit uppe.”\n- “Bra med nedtrappningstips. Kan den inte ge mer detaljerade tips om hur jag ska trappa ner? “\n\nAmbitionen är att fortsätta utveckla Snusfri så att den passar fler typer av sluta snusare.

Find out why each one is a great stroke technique and how to make it work best for you.\n\nAbout Swim Smooth:\n\nSwim Smooth is an innovative coaching company focusing on improving your individual stroke technique based on your height, build, gender and swimming experience.\n\nWe have coaching bases in Australia and the UK, and in 2011 we were selected by British Triathlon to write their swimming coaching curriculum. All triathlon coaches in the UK now follow our swim coaching methods.\n\nFind out more about us at https://www.swimsmooth.com"

The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

It is commonly used by coaches and trainers to measure athlete fitness, or used as a pre-requisite for police, emergency and military organizations. \n\nThe standard test has 21 levels, and each level consists of a different number of shuttles. The test is performed by running between two markers placed 20 meters (65.6 feet) apart, at an increasing pace as indicated by the beeps. The test ends when you can no longer keep pace, or level 21 is completed.\n\nDetailed information about each test variation can be found in the app's online help."

Select style, mode, source and color, and even what the widgets should open when tapping on them. \n\nYou can choose up to 11 different layout styles, from small to medium sized widgets, making the combination you want for your home screen.\n\nThis app uses HeathKit to obtain information about your movement, weight, oxygen levels, blood glucose, sleep and heart beat values, should you consent the app to do so upon launch. \n\nNote: the update frequency of the widgets depend on the iOS itself, not controllable by the app. The operating system will decide how often the widgets need to refresh, but you can force refresh them by entering the Hidgets app once and go back to the home screen.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me at schmitzoide@gmail.com or visit the website https://hidgets.com.\n\nThank you so much for your support! \n\nWith love from Portugal,\nMarcel"

This is something that the fixed conventional mechanical watches and clocks struggle to allow for, but dynamic screen of smartwatches and smartphones are perfectly suited to such fluctuations. \n\nCirca Solar helps us to synchronise the intrinsic relationship between our circadian rhythms, our mental and physical health, and the geophysical rhythms of light and dark. Circa Solar visualises the critical solar information contained in fluctuating daily and seasonal sunlight cycles. Such light cycles act as the primary zeitgeber (periodic external cues capable of entraining biological rhythms) that influence and govern the behaviours and physiology of nearly all living organisms. \n\nGrowing research in the fields of circadian health and chronobiology shows profound potential benefits to not only our individual mental and physical health (through improved mood, energy, sleep, resilience, and wellbeing) but also in an increased appreciation of the coexistence we share with nature as circadian organisms."

I found a workout log that just works for me. I consider myself pretty advanced when it comes to working out so I have very specific needs for things like a workout log.»\n«I’ve only been using the app for 5 minutes and know it is going to be AMAZING! I’ve been ‘playing’ with many similar apps but this is so easy to use. Huge thumbs up! :)» \n\nFEATURES: \n• Log your workouts.\n• Create exercises.\n• See your PR’s\n• See your 1RM and Volume.\n• Add notes to workouts.\n• Add sticky notes to exercises.\n• Add your bodyweight (Optional: Can be added from Apple Healthkit).\n• Export data to excel (csv)."

All you need is “You”, some comfortable clothing to move in, and your phone. What makes this App truly unique is its ability to accurately diagnose exactly what your body needs on a particular day using Traditional Chinese Medical diagnostics, and then designs you a specifically tailored moving meditation exercise program for the symptoms you are experiencing.\n\nThis groundbreaking App is easy to use and has three different options to help you care for your mind, breath and body.\n\nOption #1 - Do the Full Set\nFor first time users, this would be one of two options to start with. By clicking this option, the app will take your through 8 different videos that comprise the entire qigong workout. Just follow along to heal yourself.\n\nOption # 2 Get prescribed exercises\nFor first time or returning users, have the app diagnose what exercises you need on this specific day to heal your body. Use the five different organ drop down menus to select what symptoms you are experiencing and the app will design a tailored workout specifically for you.\n\nOption #3\nFor returning users who are familiar with the app, this option will. allow you to choose whatever exercises you want to do today.\n\nQigong (pronounced Chee Gong) has been used in China as a preventative health methodology for nearly five thousand years. There are over 3600 different Qigong styles, Tai Qi, being on the of the most well known. In essence, Qi gong is composed of soft, slow, calisthenics (body weight) movements designed to stimulate the major acupuncture meridians of the body, which in turn, have a corresponding effect on the internal organs, As Qigong is performed, the mind is engaged in specific visualizations, coordinated with specific breathing patterns, in doing so, the physical movements become a moving meditation."

      "label": "Description\n\nUltraTrainer is your virtual coach, trainer, and training partner. It is a revolutionary timer which was not available previously on any mobile device. \n\nThere are two types of intervals which can be mixed in UltraTrainer:\n- Traditional Intervals \n- Randomized Action Intervals \n\nIn a traditional interval, the interval is a specified duration. This is what you would normally expect from an interval timer. Routines such as Tabata, HIIT, etc, are incredibly easy to setup and modify.\n\nThe Randomized Action Intervals is where UltraTrainer truly breaks new ground. UltraTrainer will call out Actions for you to perform in random order AND at random times that you control. \n\nFor example, if you are shadow boxing or hitting the heavy bag, you would normally think of a combination of punches and throw them. Instead of consciously coming up with the combination, UltraTrainer can tell you what punches to throw. It can call out 'JAB!', then a second later 'JAB CROSS!', then a second and a half later, 'CROSS HOOK!', until the interval ends.\n\nThis is how UltraTrainer can be your virtual coach/trainer/training-partner: you can not train reactionary reflexes without somebody or something telling you what to do in random order and at random times.\n\nMartial artists can work on reflexes by creating timers that randomize movement (\"Forward!\", \"Backwards!\") and actions (\"Sprawl!\"). \n\nCyclists can simulate mountain road courses by setting up intervals that randomize pedaling speed.\n\nCrossfit athletes make HEAVY use of timers for quick high-intensity workouts. The sample timer \"Fight Gone Horribly Wrong\" is based on \"Fight Gone Bad\" but with a twist. Each of the 5 stations is called out in random order and the duration at each station is randomized between 20 seconds and 1 minute. The result? A franticly paced workout because you never REALLY know when the next station will be called out so you have to try to completely exert yourself at the current station.\n\nFor a complete workout, you can set up a Timer Group which will play individual timers back to back. Start out with your favorite Warm Up timer,  then run through your favorite Training timer, and end with a Stretching timer. UltraTrainer will run you through your full workout automatically.\n\nExclusive to our products, users can browse the Timer Exchange, a community where people freely exchange timers. Search, browse, and download timers that other users have uploaded. If you want, you can upload your own timers to share with others.\n\nYou can also trade timers directly with a friend using E-mail, or the clipboard to transfer them other ways.\n\nUltraTrainer can be used for martial arts, mma, boxing, bjj, circuit training, interval training (Tabata, HIIT), Crossfit, yoga, meditation, cycling, running / sprinting, swimming, time-management, multi-stage recipes for cooking, weight lifting, stretching, and anything else you might be able to think of. As you can see, UltraTrainer can be used in all sorts of situations.\n\nFeatures in UltraTrainer:\n- Timer Exchange community\n- Runs in the background\n- Random interval actions\n- Copy/Paste Intervals and Actions\n- Rearrange intervals\n- Delayed start time\n- Over 70 included sounds\n- Record your own sounds\n- Large portrait or landscape countdown timer display\n- Help system explains each option on the current screen\n- iPod music playback control lets you pause/play the current track or move to the next track from the countdown timer screen\n- Pause the timer to temporarily halt the activity\n- Timer state is saved if interrupted\n- Will still run if screen is locked\n- Intuitive setup"

Bara några få yinyogapass kan göra den skillnaden i ditt liv.\n\nYinyoga passar alla åldrar och kroppstyper. Den kan göras av vem som helst, när som helst och var som helst. Du behöver inte någon särskild utrustning eller ens byta kläder. Den är en av de enklaste yogastilarna. Den gör stela muskler smidiga, strama leder rörliga och ett rastlöst sinne stabilt. Nyckeln är att ligga länge i ställningarna, tre eller fem minuter (om du kan), eller längre.\n\nI denna app har jag samlat mina mest populära klasser och pass. Förutom många längre, allmänna yogapass är en del skapade för specifika problem, som Jetlag eller Huvudvärk, medan andra är för en specifik situation, exempelvis TV-passet eller Efter jobbet.\n\nJag leder dig in och igenom alla yogaställningar med min röst, precis som om du var elev på en av mina yinyogaklasser. Jag tajmar dig till tre eller fem minuter, och stödjer dig medan du ligger i ställningarna.\n\nDen bästa yogan är den som blir av, och med min app har det aldrig varit lättare att starta och upprätthålla din yinyoga hemma.\n\nMin önskan och förhoppning är att yinyoga ska öka din energi och vitalitet, göra dig vig och lugn. Lägg dig i de enkla ställningarna, slappna av och låt livet ha sin gång.\n\nOm du yinyogar en gång om dagen är det fantastiskt.\nOm du yinyogar en gång i veckan är det fantastiskt.\nOm du yinyogar en enda gång är det också fantastiskt!\n\n— Magdalena Mecweld\n\n- - -\n\n• Appen innehåller alla 30 yinyogaställningar, upplästa av författaren och beskrivna i vackra bilder och tydliga texter.\n\n• Appen innehåller 30 yinyogapass. Sammanlagt många timmars lärarledd yinyoga för mindre än priset av en yogaklass!\n\n• Appen innehåller även en längre ledd vila och en lång mindfullness-meditation.\n\n• Appen har en funktion för att välja favoritpositioner och skapa ett eget yinyogapass. Du kan även dela ditt pass till vänner.\n\n• Allt material i appen laddas ned och ingen internetanslutning behövs efter installation.\n\n• Appen är optimerad för alla Apple-enheter, både iPhones och iPads. \n\n• Med endast ett köp kan appen installeras i alla dina enheter som har samma iTunes-konto.\n\n- - -\n\nSVENSKSPRÅKIG APP\n\nObservera: denna app är endast på svenska. Den engelska appen heter “Yin yoga”.\n\n- - -"

In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

      "label": "Mood Mint combines a variety of psychological techniques to help boost your mood, and reduce stress, anxiety and depression.\n\nThere are 4 main components to Mood Mint (all backed by hard science):\n\n1) COGNITIVE BIAS MODIFICATION\nAttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is a computer-based therapy that gets the user to repeatedly select positive information over negative information. The aim of the game is to tap the positive image as quickly as possible. In this way, CBM helps train your brain to automatically focus more on positive information in your everyday life.The result: less stress and a happier you. \n\nStudies show that Bias Modification can effectively lower anxiety with as little as 2 hours of treatment. A number of studies have shown that CBM can also help to alleviate depression. After several weeks of CBM, participants showed increased activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex – the area of the brain associated with more positive, happier thinking.\n\nMood Mint allows you to fully customize the Cognitive Bias Modification game – edit, delete, or add your own images for a personalized CBM experience. Add pictures of things you are grateful for, happy events and people that are special to you and give them a positive charge. These will also help to trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals during each training session.\n\n\nIf you would like to find out more about Atttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (ACBM), and how it is being used to treat anxiety and depression,  please visit BiasModification.com\n\n\n2) HAPPY NOTES\nSlides will appear during the cognitive bias modification session. These are loaded with bite-sized mental health tips, facts, stats, techniques and exercises to help boost your mood.  You can take your time reading the slides and carrying out the exercises as the timer will stop while they are on screen. \n\nAll of the 'Happy Notes' are based on leading research and theory in psychology and neuroscience fields. Each and every one of them can help to lower stress and anxiety, and improve overall mental health and wellbeing. \n\nGo to Settings to edit and add your own happy notes to the program.\n\n3) POSITIVE WORD SEARCH\nJust as focusing your attention on negative or threatening information can trigger the release of stress chemicals like cortisol and adrenaline, so focusing on positive information can trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals like serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.\n\nResearch in the fields of psychology and neuroscience  have shown that our brains automatically releases feel-good neurochemicals whenever we focus on a positive word.\n\nThe word search is designed to trigger these ‘feel-good’ chemicals by getting you to focus on positive words. You need to find all 4 of the words listed below the letter grid to complete the word search. Drag your finger over the letters in the grid to highlight each of the words listed.\n\nTo maximise the positive psychological effect, try to think of all the positive things you associate with each word as you search for it.\n\n4) BREATHING EXERCISE\nThere is a guided breathing exercise at the end of each training session. Focusing on your breathing helps to ground you in the present, and triggers the parasympathetic (‘rest and digest’) response, helping you to instantly  feel  a little calmer. Focused breathing is an important element of mindful meditation, and it comes with a long list of mental health benefits.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that focused breathing meditation alone can help to lower stress, reduce anxiety and depression.\n\nHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN?\nThe short answer – as often as you need to. For optimal results, you should aim to train for around 5 to 10 minutes per day,  and anytime in between if you're feeling stressed, anxious or upset.\n\nTo complete the program, you need to earn 10 000 points."

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music.

Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

      "label": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly!

Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

      "label": "Less negative stress with mindfulness!\n\nUsing this app you can participate in Awareness Training (AT) according to Andries J. Kroese. Mindfulness is intentional awareness. Therefore mindfulness training and AT are closely related. \n\nAT is concerned with alert relaxation of mind and body, but even more so with reprogramming the mind/body from negative thoughts and habits to a more stress reducing lifestyle. AT is a self-developing process by being aware of our thoughts, feelings and behavior. The type of awareness we are using was called by J. Krishnamurti “choiceless awareness”, a way of looking at the events of living with an open, non-judgmental mind.\n\nWith AT we practice to accept the waves of life, instead of protesting against them. We learn how to surf on them, using their energy to get into the flow of life. The key to this is living in the NOW, the present moment from moment to moment.\n\nTo be able to keep our balance in stormy weather, we have to set aside time to practice AT under quiet, peaceful circumstances.\n\nIn this app you will find practical awareness exercises which you can use for your personal training:\n\n1. Introduction (3:58 min)\n2. Awareness meditation (23:42)\n3. Body scan meditation (18:04)\n4. Awareness yoga (24:11)\n5. AT in daily life (3:55)"

      "label": "Heart Rate Variability measurements recorded by your Apple Watch can give you insight on the stress level your body is under. By using HRV Tracker to track short-term measurements and long-term trends, you can see how your workload during the day, workout sessions or sleeping etc affect your body's readiness, recovery and stress level. Simply put, the higher your HRV is, the better.\n\n***Requires an HRV capable Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later***\nHRV Tracker for Watch integrates with the Health app and uses data stored in the Health app. To make sure your Apple Watch is capable of recording HRV measurements, please open the Health app on your iPhone to see if any HRV measurements exists. Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

      "label": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. It is measured by the variation in the beat-to-beat interval. \r\nThis HRV app provides a way to analyze the HRV SDNN values recorded by the Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nHeart rate variability describes the ability of an organism to change the frequency of the heart rhythm. A healthy person constantly adapts the heart rhythm to the current requirements. The number of heart beats per minute is therefore constantly changing, which is a good sign of the organism's ability to adapt.\r\n\r\nResearchers at the University of Zaragoza in Spain have shown that the values recorded by the Apple Watch during a session with the Breath app are very accurate. Comparable with professional chest straps.\r\n\r\nTo filter your own HRV data, this app offers the possibility to display only those HRV values that are recorded during such a session.\r\n\r\nThe Apple Watch is measuring your HRV Data and writes it to Healthkit.\r\nThis app connects with Apple’s Health app to displays the recorded data on a Watch App, a complication and your Iphone. \r\n\r\nHow to Use:\r\n-\tATTENTION: This app only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 3 or later.\r\n-\tIf you want to measure a new value, use the Breath App from Apple.\r\n-\tTo get to most out of your data it is important that you measurement does always take place in the very same situation. For example: \"First thing in the morning\" before getting up."

      "label": "“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \n\n“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \n\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \n\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \n\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.\n\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \n\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \n\nIf you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\n\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \nFor curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section."

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio. Plus export to Google Sheets, FIT and GPX file formats."

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

Bara några få yinyogapass kan göra den skillnaden i ditt liv.\n\nYinyoga passar alla åldrar och kroppstyper. Den kan göras av vem som helst, när som helst och var som helst. Du behöver inte någon särskild utrustning eller ens byta kläder. Den är en av de enklaste yogastilarna. Den gör stela muskler smidiga, strama leder rörliga och ett rastlöst sinne stabilt. Nyckeln är att ligga länge i ställningarna, tre eller fem minuter (om du kan), eller längre.\n\nI denna app har jag samlat mina mest populära klasser och pass. Förutom många längre, allmänna yogapass är en del skapade för specifika problem, som Jetlag eller Huvudvärk, medan andra är för en specifik situation, exempelvis TV-passet eller Efter jobbet.\n\nJag leder dig in och igenom alla yogaställningar med min röst, precis som om du var elev på en av mina yinyogaklasser. Jag tajmar dig till tre eller fem minuter, och stödjer dig medan du ligger i ställningarna.\n\nDen bästa yogan är den som blir av, och med min app har det aldrig varit lättare att starta och upprätthålla din yinyoga hemma.\n\nMin önskan och förhoppning är att yinyoga ska öka din energi och vitalitet, göra dig vig och lugn. Lägg dig i de enkla ställningarna, slappna av och låt livet ha sin gång.\n\nOm du yinyogar en gång om dagen är det fantastiskt.\nOm du yinyogar en gång i veckan är det fantastiskt.\nOm du yinyogar en enda gång är det också fantastiskt!\n\n— Magdalena Mecweld\n\n- - -\n\n• Appen innehåller alla 30 yinyogaställningar, upplästa av författaren och beskrivna i vackra bilder och tydliga texter.\n\n• Appen innehåller 30 yinyogapass. Sammanlagt många timmars lärarledd yinyoga för mindre än priset av en yogaklass!\n\n• Appen innehåller även en längre ledd vila och en lång mindfullness-meditation.\n\n• Appen har en funktion för att välja favoritpositioner och skapa ett eget yinyogapass. Du kan även dela ditt pass till vänner.\n\n• Allt material i appen laddas ned och ingen internetanslutning behövs efter installation.\n\n• Appen är optimerad för alla Apple-enheter, både iPhones och iPads. \n\n• Med endast ett köp kan appen installeras i alla dina enheter som har samma iTunes-konto.\n\n- - -\n\nSVENSKSPRÅKIG APP\n\nObservera: denna app är endast på svenska. Den engelska appen heter “Yin yoga”.\n\n- - -"

      "label": "Description\n\nUltraTrainer is your virtual coach, trainer, and training partner. It is a revolutionary timer which was not available previously on any mobile device. \n\nThere are two types of intervals which can be mixed in UltraTrainer:\n- Traditional Intervals \n- Randomized Action Intervals \n\nIn a traditional interval, the interval is a specified duration. This is what you would normally expect from an interval timer. Routines such as Tabata, HIIT, etc, are incredibly easy to setup and modify.\n\nThe Randomized Action Intervals is where UltraTrainer truly breaks new ground. UltraTrainer will call out Actions for you to perform in random order AND at random times that you control. \n\nFor example, if you are shadow boxing or hitting the heavy bag, you would normally think of a combination of punches and throw them. Instead of consciously coming up with the combination, UltraTrainer can tell you what punches to throw. It can call out 'JAB!', then a second later 'JAB CROSS!', then a second and a half later, 'CROSS HOOK!', until the interval ends.\n\nThis is how UltraTrainer can be your virtual coach/trainer/training-partner: you can not train reactionary reflexes without somebody or something telling you what to do in random order and at random times.\n\nMartial artists can work on reflexes by creating timers that randomize movement (\"Forward!\", \"Backwards!\") and actions (\"Sprawl!\"). \n\nCyclists can simulate mountain road courses by setting up intervals that randomize pedaling speed.\n\nCrossfit athletes make HEAVY use of timers for quick high-intensity workouts. The sample timer \"Fight Gone Horribly Wrong\" is based on \"Fight Gone Bad\" but with a twist. Each of the 5 stations is called out in random order and the duration at each station is randomized between 20 seconds and 1 minute. The result? A franticly paced workout because you never REALLY know when the next station will be called out so you have to try to completely exert yourself at the current station.\n\nFor a complete workout, you can set up a Timer Group which will play individual timers back to back. Start out with your favorite Warm Up timer,  then run through your favorite Training timer, and end with a Stretching timer. UltraTrainer will run you through your full workout automatically.\n\nExclusive to our products, users can browse the Timer Exchange, a community where people freely exchange timers. Search, browse, and download timers that other users have uploaded. If you want, you can upload your own timers to share with others.\n\nYou can also trade timers directly with a friend using E-mail, or the clipboard to transfer them other ways.\n\nUltraTrainer can be used for martial arts, mma, boxing, bjj, circuit training, interval training (Tabata, HIIT), Crossfit, yoga, meditation, cycling, running / sprinting, swimming, time-management, multi-stage recipes for cooking, weight lifting, stretching, and anything else you might be able to think of. As you can see, UltraTrainer can be used in all sorts of situations.\n\nFeatures in UltraTrainer:\n- Timer Exchange community\n- Runs in the background\n- Random interval actions\n- Copy/Paste Intervals and Actions\n- Rearrange intervals\n- Delayed start time\n- Over 70 included sounds\n- Record your own sounds\n- Large portrait or landscape countdown timer display\n- Help system explains each option on the current screen\n- iPod music playback control lets you pause/play the current track or move to the next track from the countdown timer screen\n- Pause the timer to temporarily halt the activity\n- Timer state is saved if interrupted\n- Will still run if screen is locked\n- Intuitive setup"

The app also makes it easy to keep track of where you are in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThis Russian squat cycle has also been used by many for other lifts such as the bench press, shoulder press and deadlift with big jumps in strength. Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

      "label": "The Healing Your Thoughts App improves your state of health and well being by assisting you to transform your negative thoughts that arise throughout the day. It is important to break the habit of dropping into defeatist thoughts and attitudes and learn how to stop yourself from entering into a negative loop that blocks you from achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nThe Healing Your Thoughts App helps to shift the way you think throughout the day and will help to uplift you during challenging times. You are not denying any feelings you are experiencing. Rather it is a process of rephrasing your thoughts to change your train of thought which will lead you to a positive outcome.\n\nYou can program the app for the interval of when you would like to receive an alert of bells, a Tibetan bowl, or chimes being played. When you hear the alert you will read the message that asks you to reflect on: “What are you thinking about right now?” Your thoughts and words are seeds that when planted into your inner garden will grow into plants that do impact your life. It is important to cultivate a deep and rich inner garden to create true joy and health in your life.\n\nOnce you receive the alert go into the Library and tap on the category “word”, “phrase”, “blessing”, or “photo”. A word, phrase, blessing, or photo will appear that will inspire you to stop your current thinking and transmute/transform any negative thinking into positive thoughts. This will also help to shift your attitude and even create an inner smile.\n\nYou can use the words, phrases, blessings, or photos provided. Or you can upload your own.\n\nThe result will be that you will experience feeling more uplifted. In this way you feed yourself with love and light. This will improve your life, giving you more energy, and help you to be more creative in your life and in your work. You will be able to radiate love and light towards yourself, your loved ones, friends, co-workers, and into the world."

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

It is important to distinguish between simple carbohydrates - for example from sweets and classic table sugar - and complex carbohydrates, which you can find in whole grains and vegetables, for example.\n\nWhen people talk about “unhealthy sugar”, they usually mean classic table sugar and simple carbohydrates from confectionery and white flour. Complex carbohydrates are metabolized completely differently and are useful and healthy sources of energy. However, you should keep your hands off classic sugar. Why? For these 4 reasons.\n\nSugar makes you fat\nAll carbohydrates are first broken down by the body into their individual building blocks. What's left is glucose. Glucose is metabolized with the help of the hormone insulin. The insulin ensures that the sugar gets to the cells where it is needed in the form of energy.\nThe more sugar you eat, the more insulin is released. So too much sugar messes up and skyrockets your insulin levels. This is unfavorable in two ways: On the one hand, the hormone reduces fat burning. On the other hand, after such insulin spikes, the amount of sugar in the blood quickly drops to an absolute minimum again. The result: renewed cravings for sugar. This creates a vicious circle that causes you to constantly ingest sugar and increase your daily caloric intake.\n\nSugar is addicting\nSugar ensures that more dopamine is released in the brain's reward center. The happiness hormone evokes a good mood and feelings of happiness. Unfortunately only for a short time. As soon as the effects wear off, the brain craves for more. This creates a vicious circle that leads you to eat more and more sugar.\n\nSugar makes you sick\nThis is nothing new. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay are the most well-known dangers associated with too much sugar. Studies also indicate that too much concentrated fructose in particular favors the formation of invisible but unhealthy fat that is deposited between and around the organs. Isolated fructose, which is used to sweeten fruit drinks and sweets, also inhibits the hormone leptin, which is responsible for feeling full.\n\nSugar makes you look old\nIf you eat too much sugar at once, your body cannot completely convert it into energy. The excess sugar molecules then combine with proteins that are responsible for the elasticity of your skin. The result: Unsightly wrinkles.\nThese compounds of sugar and protein also bind to the receptors of immune cells and thus promote inflammation and poor blood circulation in the skin. In short: the more sugar, the more unsightly the complexion.\n\nWith the help of this app you can stop eating sweets overnight and follow your positive health progress.\nThis app also gives you the opportunity to save money.\nThanks to the push notification, you will always be rewarded to stop eating sweets.\n\nHave fun living healthy."

Do the test.(max pullups as you can). Choose a training cycle based on your test results. For example, if you've done 7 pullups, you start our program from the 6-8 cycle.\n2. Remember to rest between training sessions for at least one day, and after 3 sessions for at least 2 days.\n3. If during a cycle you weren't able to do all sets of pullups for a given day, don't worry. Rest for 2 or 3 days and then try again.\n4. After finishing a cycle rest for at least 2 days before you do another test.\n5. After a 2 day break start your next training cycle.\n6. Follow the above instructions until you reach the last cycle (more than 40 pullups). When you reach the last cycle, you will be in a very good shape and you will be able to try to do 50 pullups.\n7. After finishing the last training cycle take a break, relax for a couple of days and then do the test again. This time there's a big chance that you will reach 50 pullups. If not, don't worry. Do the last cycle again, and repeat again.\nGood luck!"

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "Mood Mint combines a variety of psychological techniques to help boost your mood, and reduce stress, anxiety and depression.\n\nThere are 4 main components to Mood Mint (all backed by hard science):\n\n1) COGNITIVE BIAS MODIFICATION\nAttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is a computer-based therapy that gets the user to repeatedly select positive information over negative information. The aim of the game is to tap the positive image as quickly as possible. In this way, CBM helps train your brain to automatically focus more on positive information in your everyday life.The result: less stress and a happier you. \n\nStudies show that Bias Modification can effectively lower anxiety with as little as 2 hours of treatment. A number of studies have shown that CBM can also help to alleviate depression. After several weeks of CBM, participants showed increased activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex – the area of the brain associated with more positive, happier thinking.\n\nMood Mint allows you to fully customize the Cognitive Bias Modification game – edit, delete, or add your own images for a personalized CBM experience. Add pictures of things you are grateful for, happy events and people that are special to you and give them a positive charge. These will also help to trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals during each training session.\n\n\nIf you would like to find out more about Atttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (ACBM), and how it is being used to treat anxiety and depression,  please visit BiasModification.com\n\n\n2) HAPPY NOTES\nSlides will appear during the cognitive bias modification session. These are loaded with bite-sized mental health tips, facts, stats, techniques and exercises to help boost your mood.  You can take your time reading the slides and carrying out the exercises as the timer will stop while they are on screen. \n\nAll of the 'Happy Notes' are based on leading research and theory in psychology and neuroscience fields. Each and every one of them can help to lower stress and anxiety, and improve overall mental health and wellbeing. \n\nGo to Settings to edit and add your own happy notes to the program.\n\n3) POSITIVE WORD SEARCH\nJust as focusing your attention on negative or threatening information can trigger the release of stress chemicals like cortisol and adrenaline, so focusing on positive information can trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals like serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.\n\nResearch in the fields of psychology and neuroscience  have shown that our brains automatically releases feel-good neurochemicals whenever we focus on a positive word.\n\nThe word search is designed to trigger these ‘feel-good’ chemicals by getting you to focus on positive words. You need to find all 4 of the words listed below the letter grid to complete the word search. Drag your finger over the letters in the grid to highlight each of the words listed.\n\nTo maximise the positive psychological effect, try to think of all the positive things you associate with each word as you search for it.\n\n4) BREATHING EXERCISE\nThere is a guided breathing exercise at the end of each training session. Focusing on your breathing helps to ground you in the present, and triggers the parasympathetic (‘rest and digest’) response, helping you to instantly  feel  a little calmer. Focused breathing is an important element of mindful meditation, and it comes with a long list of mental health benefits.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that focused breathing meditation alone can help to lower stress, reduce anxiety and depression.\n\nHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN?\nThe short answer – as often as you need to. For optimal results, you should aim to train for around 5 to 10 minutes per day,  and anytime in between if you're feeling stressed, anxious or upset.\n\nTo complete the program, you need to earn 10 000 points."

      "label": "Want to get fit and feel fantastic? Want to add some fresh air to your exercise? Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

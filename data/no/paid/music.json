      "label": "SYNG meg i søvn er en vakkert illustrert app med kjente og kjære nattasanger for barn mellom 0-7 år.\n\nSYNG meg i søvn er den siste appen fra det bestselgende SYNG-universet! I appen blir barna tatt med inn i en magisk eventyrskog hvor mørket faller på. Det er mange trette små skapninger som gjemmer seg i skogen og som ikke får sove før feen Syngeling har sunget en nattasang for dem. Kan du finne alle dyrene slik at Syngeling kan synge dem i søvn?\n\nTil hver sang finnes det mange rare instrumenter og lyder du kan trykke på, og som spiller vakkert med til melodiene. På denne måten kan hver sang høres forskjellig ut hver gang du spiller den av.\n\nNår alle dyrene i eventyrskogen har sovnet er det barnet sin tur til å sove.\n\nBarna kan utforske eventyrskogen på et trygt fang, eller helt på egenhånd da appen er spesielt tilpasset de yngste barnas motoriske nivå.\n\n\nDETTE FÅR DU:\n\n11 kjente og kjære godnattsanger sunget på norsk. Håndtegnet av illustratør Cecilie Ellefsen og flott animert i et vakkert skogsmiljø:\n\nBlinke blinke stjerne lill / Trollmors vuggesang / Den lille Ole med paraplyen / Brahms vuggesang / Byssan Lull / Kjære gud / Hvem kan segla / Vi har en tulle / Sulla meg litt / Blåmann / Sov du vesle spire ung\n\n\nBARN LÆRER SPRÅK GJENNOM SANG\n\nVisste du at mange barn synger og bruker språket fra sangtekster lenge før de produserer eget språk? Språkforskere finner stadig flere sammenhenger mellom sang- og språkutvikling hos små barn. Når barna synger trener de på å uttale ord og setninger uten at de opplever dette som trening. Sang- og musikkaktiviteter gjør barn tryggere på språk, og SYNG kan nettopp være et nyttig hjelpemiddel for å gjøre det enkelt og gøy å synge barnesanger.\n\n\nVI VIL HØRE DIN MENING\n\nDin mening er viktig for oss! Send oss gjerne en tilbakemelding på hvordan vi kan gjøre SYNG enda bedre for deg og de små menneskene i livet ditt:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/syngapp/\n\nInstagram: @syng_app\n\nWeb: https://www.syng-app.no/\n\nSupport: games@stormfilms.no\n\nLiker du SYNG setter vi enormt pris på en hyggelig omtale i App Store!\n\nSYNG meg i søvn er utviklet av Storm Films med støtte fra Norsk Filminstitutt og Viken Filmsenter"

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location.

      "label": "A creative bass synth sequencer for creating electro melodies or dirty phat & funky pure acid techno 303 style basslines. With LIVE CONTROL feature to trigger and transpose both sequences and new synth pad layer.\nInspired by the acid house music scene. An IOS exclusive, compared to a modern equivalent to Rebirth (Rebirth was a popular tb - 303 clone a decade ago). \nLook at the video tutorial for a how-to guide. Listen to what you can create easily with 2XB303.\nCreate electro, house, techno, edm  or synth sequences using standard step functions as seen on various sequencers like the Roland SH 101 synthesizer. \nBuilt in pad layer than follows pitch. Transpose and trigger sequence even with MIDI\nYour synth sequences can also be generated randomly, shuffled or modify just notes.\nEasily capture whatever you hear and export to AudioShare, Audio-Copy, Email or iTunes Shared Folder. \nSupport for Audiobus 3 routing, Ableton Link, IAA (Inter App Audio)\nTweaking cut-off & decay Env-Mod & glide & accent etc for that classic sweet-spot acid growl Tap to dials to swipe up & down for fine adjustment of knobs.\n\nThe sound was first compared to a Cyclone TT - 303 synthesizer & tweaked to extend sound shaping beyond a just bass maker. Waves have optional harmonic version, noise, LFO, glide speed & PHAT/ BASS, and great effects. This is designed to give pure electro music creativity beyond an acid synth 303 bass maker to create dynamically fluctuating overlaying electronic patterns. A good addition to any electro, drum and bass, acid, techno, house and any other EDM fans\n\nLIVE CONTROL feature:\nUse the keyboard for the following cool tricks:\n[Sequence/Control/Transpose]: Transpose both channels simultaneously while playing. Now ability to trigger sequence too, with synth pad layer. (optional and 22 sounds)\n[Sequence/Control/Pattern]:  Instantly switch to a saved sequence while playing. Keys correspond to stored program numbers, starting from the current program thats loaded (key 1 is your current program, key 2 is current program+1). Highlighted keys show stored programs. This is great for building up live tracks, or instant crossfading between programs. You can also \"Hold settings\" so it locks settings like effects.\n \nMETRONOME: Toggle drum beats -better than tick-tocks to accompany your bass lines\n\nMOD:\nLFO auto control low pass CUT-OFF and/or PITCH. The pitch level can give a vintage synthesiser effect subtly detuning with low SPEED or faster for chaotic random pitches.\n\nEFFECTS (Global/master are in yellow.)\nOVERDRIVE, COMPRESSION adjusts threshold, ratio, & gain. This is a global effect.\nECHO tempo synced with feedback & wetness. \nSAVE ALL. When not playing, save to memory.\n\nSYNCING\nAbleton Link syncs with apps .Enable for precise timing without syncing. Press LINK button at the bottom for settings.\nMIDI sync with External, Virtual or Audiobus.  2XB 303 can be master or slave. ( any simple class-compliant USB should work but some may need to be power assisted)  \nVirtual MIDI In is always on. If you send from another app AND receive MIDI clock then you will be receiving both MIDI CLOCKS. Choose only one unless you want double tempo (which can be interesting).\nWhile Ableton Link is enabled you can send clock. This means you can use one app to control 2XB303 synth alongside external hardware sequencers\nMIDI note data is sent out on each channel\n\nAUDIO\nRecord a fixed length, default to 32 steps. Can be changed in settings.\nArming the sampling with CAPTURE (flashing). Starts at counter 1 (ON). \nPLAY CAP to listen to your super cool sampled acid synthesiser loop.\n\nAudiobus 3 and IAA (Inter App Audio) Support. Route audio to mix or record into other applications\nAudio can be routed via IAA into apps like Apple's Garageband. \nGarageband will also sync your sequence for excellent multi-track recording.\n\nTo save you press \"Save all\", it then flashes. Now choose destination (\"!\" means its occupied ) then press \"Save All\" to confirm."

      "label": "Way more than a metronome, the Time Trainer adds five training tools to help you develop your own internal sense of time!\n\nThis is an accurate and stable metronome (many metronome apps out there are not) and features:\n• tap tempo (to work out tempos by tapping a button),\n• countdown timer (for keeping your practice to schedule!)\n• many different sounds (you like cowbell, wood or xylophone?)\n• accent control (for odd time playing)\n• visual metronome movement with a flash on the beat\n• vibrate option (on each beat or just accent)\n\n...but then we add to that with five training tools which will really help you develop your own time feel - essential for all musicians!\n\n• Bar Breaks • will mute the metronome for a bar or more forcing you to keep your time solid and be perfectly synchronized when the clicks return! This is a superb exercise and will really help develop confidence in holding your tempo. You can adjust how many bars are solid at the start then how many bars are solid and how many bars are muted which will cycle for the duration of the session. You can also select \"random\" mode and a % of bars (that you set) that will be dropped for an even more challenging practice session!\n\n• Random Beat Drop • does exactly what it says on the tin... some of the beats (clicks) will be muted at random, forcing you to be confident with your time and not rely on the click too much. Many people chase the beat or try and anticipate it, and this exercise will help you stop those bad habits! I've personally found that the \"gradual\" setting is most useful, a five minute session starting at 100% with more and more beats muted up to the % that you set.\n\n• Speed Up • is a tool I have wanted for years for my own practice so now I made one. Often when working on scales, arpeggios or licks you want to start at an easy speed where you are playing it 100% correctly and gradually push your technique by playing it faster and faster. With this tool you set a start tempo, end tempo and duration of you practice session and off you go, no more stopping to bump the bpm up a few notches every minute!\n\n• Step Upper • Many people requested that we make a programmable mode, most likely to be used to be able to move from one consistent tempo to another, rather than the gradual increase you get in the Speed Upper. You can program a tempo for X number of bars OR minutes :)\n\n• Subdivisions • Another heavily requested feature was to add in subdivisions for those that need to hear them, and for super slow tempo's where having subdivisions can be really helpful!\n\nI'm sure you will find all of the tools very useful, and of course you will find full support on the justinguitar community forum - please take the time to rate and review it, good things will help promote it and anything negative will help me improve it!\n\nWishing you many happy hours of practice :) Justin"

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com. I may be able to fix your issue in less time than it would take to write a negative review!"

Du vil sannsynligvis finne ut at du slett ikke trenger å kjøpe ny DAB-radio likevel.\n\nDu får ALLE norske radiokanaler på ett sted:\n • Kanalene som er borte fra FM\n • Kanalene som fortsatt er på FM\n • Lokalradioer som er utenfor rekkevidde på FM\n • Nettradioer som aldri har vært på FM\n • Alle DAB-kanalene\n\nAppen koster:\n • Bare en brøkdel av en knotete DAB-adapter\n • Nesten ingenting i forhold til en ny bilstereo\n • Omtrent det samme som ei pølse på bensinstasjonen\n\nAppen er optimalisert for bruk i bil:\n • Mer trafikksikker enn en bilstereo, DAB-adapter eller andre radio-apper\n • Store, tydelige knapper\n • Bare dine utvalgte favorittkanaler\n • Kommuniserer med din eksisterende bilstereo/rattkontroll\n • Ingen forstyrrende elementer\n\nFlere bruksområder enn bilstereoen! Siden du fortsatt har med deg appen når du forlater bilen, kan du også bruke den:\n • I en dockingstasjon på jobben\n • Med hodetelefoner på trening/tur\n • Koblet til stereoanlegget hjemme\n\nAndre fordeler:\n • Du kan lytte til norske radiokanaler også når du er i utlandet. De fleste mobilabonnementer lar deg bruke mobildata på samme vilkår i EU/EØS som i Norge.\n • Lydkvaliteten er like god, og i mange tilfeller bedre enn DAB+, fordi DAB har begrenset båndbredde som må fordeles mellom kanalene, mens de i denne appen alltid spilles i full kvalitet.\n • I mange tunneler der DAB-radioen bryter, spiller denne appen uten problemer.\n\nHvor mye mobildata vil det kreve å bruke denne appen?\n1 GB gir ca. 18 timer med radiolytting. \nPå et typisk mobilabonnement, med 3 GB mobildata inkludert per måned, vil de aller fleste ha mer enn nok mobildata til å bruke appen hver gang de kjører bil.\nNår du er tilkoblet WiFi-nettet hjemme eller på jobb, bruker du ingen mobildata."

      "label": "iVCS3\nOfficial EMS VCS3 emulator\n\nThe VCS3 was created in 1969 by Peter Zinovieff's EMS company. The electronics were largely designed by David Cockerell and the machine's distinctive visual appearance was the work of electronic composer Tristram Cary. The VCS3 was more or less the first portable commercially available synthesizer—portable in the sense that the VCS 3 was housed entirely in a small, wooden case.\nThe VCS3 was quite popular among progressive rock bands and was used on recordings by The Alan Parsons Project, Jean Michel Jarre, Hawkwind, Brian Eno (with Roxy Music), King Crimson, The Who, Gong, and Pink Floyd, among many others. Well-known examples of its use are on The Who track \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" (as an external sound processor, in this case with Pete Townshend running the signal of a Lowrey Organ through the VCS3's filter and low frequency oscillators) on Who's Next. Pink Floyd's \"On the Run\" (from The Dark Side of the Moon) made use of its oscillators, filter and noise generator, as well as the sequencer. Their song Welcome to the Machine also used the VCS3. The bassy throb at the beginning of the recording formed the foundation of the song, with the other parts being recorded in response. The VCS3 was also a staple at the BBC’s Radiophonic Workshop, and was a regular (and most frightening) sound generator for the Dr Who TV series. Many fo the monsters and atmoshere;s created for the show came directly from the VCS3. \n\nDescription\n\nThe VCS3 has three oscillators (in reality, the first 2 oscillators are normal oscillators and the 3rd an LFO or Low Frequency Oscillator), a noise generator, two input amplifiers, a ring modulator, a 18dB/octave (pre-1974) or 24dB/octave (after 1974) voltage controlled low pass filter (VCF), a trapezoid envelope generator, joy-stick controller, voltage controlled spring reverb unit and 2 stereo output amplifiers. Unlike most modular synthesizer systems which use cables to link components together, the VCS3 uses a distinctive patch board matrix into which pins are inserted in order to connect its components together.\nKeyboards controller\n\nDK1 keyboard controller\n\nAlthough the VCS3 is often used for generating sound effects due to lack of built-in keyboard, there were external keyboard controllers for melodic play. The DK1 in 1969 was an early velocity sensitive monophonic keyboard for VCS3 with an extra VCO and VCA. Later it was extended for duophonic play, as DK2, in 1972. Also in 1972, Synthi AKS was released, and its digital sequencer with a touch-sensitive flat keyboard, KS sequencer, and its mechanical keyboard version, DKS, were also released.\n\n(See: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCS3)"

      "label": "MusiKraken is an Experimental MIDI Controller Construction Kit.\n\nMake music using your hands, face, voice or by rotating the device!\n\nChoose from several types of modules in the editor and connect the ports to create your own MIDI controller setup. Use device sensors like Touch, Accelerometer, Microphone and Camera (face, hand and body joint tracking and depth sensor support) to generate MIDI signals. Route the MIDI signals through effect modules to control multiple instruments simultaneously or generate creative combinations.\n\nMusiKraken supports sending and receiving MIDI data over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or via Core MIDI (for example by using Inter-Device Audio and MIDI (IDAM)). And it can host Audio Unit Instruments.\n\nImportant: Please note that some of the modules only work on iOS devices with specific hardware: ARKit Face Tracking and the TrueDepth module need a TrueDepth front camera, and Hand and Body Joint Tracking needs at least iOS 14, and might be too slow on older devices.\n\nInput Modules:\n-Keyboard: MPE support, scale highlighting, control multiple values by sliding and touch pressure or finger radius.\n-Chords Pad: Play chords and its inversions of a selected scale.\n-Touchpad: Slide multiple fingers on a touchpad to control up to 5 values simultaneously.\n-ARKit Face Tracking: Uses the TrueDepth camera to generate notes or control parameters using your mouth, eyes, tongue or by moving your head.\n-Mouth Tracking: Uses the normal camera to control parameters using your mouth.\n-TrueDepth: Use the depth signal of your camera to generate MIDI data by moving your hand (or anything else) in front of the device.\n-Hand Tracking: Uses the camera to convert your hand position and simple hand gestures to MIDI. You can use one or two hands and it can also use the TrueDepth sensor if available.\n-Body Tracking: Uses the camera to track hand, feet and head positions of up to two persons.\n-Motion Sensors: Uses the combination of Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer to detect the current rotation of the device.\n-Accelerometer: Measures the acceleration of the device.\n-Apple Watch: Use the motion sensors, heart rate, touch and digital crown.\n-Game Controller: Use buttons, thumbsticks and everything else.\n-Microphone: Detects pitch and volume using the microphone.\n-External Input Device: Receives MIDI events of connected input devices.\n\nOutput Modules:\n-External Output Device: Send MIDI events to any device accessible via Core MIDI.\n-AudioUnit: Load any Music Device or MIDI Processor Audio Unit and generate sounds directly in the app.\n-Core MIDI Network: Send MIDI via WiFi.\n-Snarp Network MIDI: My own implementation to send MIDI via WiFi.\n-SimpleSynth: Generate simple synthesizer sounds directly on the device.\n\nEffects:\n-Chord Splitter: Splits incoming chords into separate notes and sends these to separate channels. This allows you to play multiple (legato-) instruments simultaneously.\n-Channel Switcher: Change the MIDI channel of events.\n-Value to MIDI Converter: To convert numerical values (green ports) to MIDI events (orange ports), it needs a converter. Converters can convert incoming numbers to notes, CC, Channel Pressure or Pitch Bend events.\n-MIDI Transposer: Transpose MIDI notes up or down.\n-Arpeggiator: Cycles through the notes of incoming chords in a specific pattern.\n-Speed: Computes a new value based on the change speed of another value.\n-Beat: Play a beat if a value is changed quickly.\n-Threshold: Plays notes if a value goes over a specific threshold.\n-LFO: Generates an LFO from incoming values.\n-Envelope: Generates an ADSR output value based on note input.\n-Latch: Keeps notes alive until the same note is played again."

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

      "label": "Fluss is a sonic playground designed by Bram Bos and Berlin-based musician Hainbach to let you explore granular synthesis in a hands-on way. The playful touch UI invites anything from live performance, experimentation to learning and mastering the granular concept.\n\nMultiple plugins: Import, Record or Live Process\nYou can import your own WAVs (standalone & AUv3 Instrument plugin), Record audio (Record effect plugin) or live-process sound (Process effect plugin) to create anything from drones and granular echoes to moving microtonal audio textures.\n\nDesigned for touch: Kinetic Sliders\nAll sliders and XY pads are linked to a physics model which lets you flick and throw them around. Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever. For more information about Audiobus, visit http://audiob.us/"

SynthStation transforms your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad into a portable music production studio for mobile music creation. SynthStation gives you three powerful synthesizers for creating and modifying sonic textures used for melodies, chords, and bass lines. Built around Akai Professional’s history in synthesis and drawing on the newest MINIAK synth, SynthStation sounds great and offers wide-ranging sonic flexibility with its virtual analog synthesis.\n\nFrom the moment you start SynthStation, you'll know your way around. It is jam-packed with tools to help you create music with the convenience of your touch screen and each section works the way you work. With SynthStation, you can create and save sequences and complete songs. The app contains three different three-oscillator synths and a range of drum kits you can sequence and mix right in the SynthStation. For creating melodic and accompaniment parts, the SynthStation contains an arpeggiator with preset patterns, built-in effects and filters, and an XY touch control interface for expressive control of key parameters.\n\nPERFORM\nPlay with keys, XY and arpeggiator controls. This is perfect place to make magic happen because it gives you access to all the common controls you’ll need in a performance or creation setting.\n\nSYNTH\nComplete synthesis controls from oscillators to LFOs, envelopes, and more. You can control a wide range of filters to dial in exactly the sound you need. Choose from Sine, Triangle, Square or Sawtooth on your VCO and start creating your own signature sounds from scratch. Filter Cutoff and Resonance are just two taps away.\n\nDRUMS\nIn addition to SynthStation's three synthesizers, we've included drum kits and a visual representation of the most iconic beat making tool in the world - MPC pads. Just pick your kit and start tapping beats anywhere, anytime. Includes:\n\nDrum Kit – select the drum kit and play it with onscreen pads.\n\nDrum Edit – tune, mix, and customize your drums.\n\nSEQUENCER\nKeyboard grid – see your keyboard sequencing and edit notes easily.\n\nDrum grid – build and modify drum tracks with a visible sequencer grid.\n\nSONG/SEQUENCE\nSelect and save your Song/Sequence projects. You can recall your Songs and work on them later, and even export them for further editing in your desktop audio applications.\n\nCONTROL\nXY – two axes of control for hands-on, real-time control. Just like a joystick, the XY controller can snap back to the zero point.\n\nTempo – control tempo and even tap in the tempo you want.\n\nMIXER\nThe Mixer in SynthStation includes touch-controlled faders for each of the three synthesizers and the drum section as well as FX send for each. \n\nMixer – mix all the levels of the parts and effects. Just like a hardware mixer, there are faders, mutes, and effect routing.\n\nEffects – select and control FX type and parameters.\n\nSynthStation Studio enables you to create and produce music anywhere on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad."

Sweep generation with In App Purchase\n\n** Spectrum  **\n\nFFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is used to calculate the frequencies in the Spectrum Analyser and these are displayed in real time. The frequency is displayed in either logarithmic or linear scale.\n\nThree FFT sizes of 8192, 4096 and 2048 are selectable, giving fine resolution of frequencies. Interpolation gives resolution to within 1Hz.\n\n 6 different FFT window function types can be selected - Hamming, Hann, Rectangular, Bartlett, Triangular and Blackman.   \n\nNumber of FFT windows can be selected from 1 through 4.\n\nThe strongest frequency is displayed both above the peak, and optionally, in a large number display in the center of the screen. The large number display can be quickly switched on or off by double tapping the screen. \n\nThere is a screen capture facility in the Spectrum Analyser allowing you to save the spectra  for future reference along with details of the FFT parameters, time and date.  \n\nA single tap freezes the screen. Other features such as screen capture and double tap to toggle large number display still work during the freeze. This feature can be turned off in preferences if it’s not desired. \n\n** Scope ** \n\nThe display of the Scope can be adjusted easily using pinch gestures in both horizontal and vertical directions. Zero crossing detection of the waveform provides a smooth display and can be set to either positive or negative direction zero crossing.\n\n  There is a screen capture facility in the Scope allowing you to save waveforms for future reference. \n\n** SPL Meter ** \n\n The SPL Meter continuously displays the sound pressure level using an A-weighting, and has resettable minimum and maximum displays also. \n\nSPL Meter can be calibrated against a reference standard or meter.\n\nSPL Meter has a continuous ticker style trace of the SPL over time. \n\n** Signal Generator ** \n  \nThe Signal Generator has 3 different output types: \n\n- Sine wave \n- White noise \n- Pink noise \n\n The output of the Signal Generator can be viewed on the other parts of the App.  \n\nThe sine wave frequency selected using picker wheels allows for accurate control of frequency to within 1Hz. Volume for the sine wave and noise signals is continuously adjustable.  \n\nWith an In App Purpose one can add a sine wave sweep generator functionality to the Signal Generator. The sweep generator can sweep increasing and decreasing frequencies, and using either a linear or log sweep rate.\n\n**Settings  **\n\nAll of the user preferences in each of the above applications can be made persistent between restarts of the App. \n\nAll parts of the App have direct access to a help document. \n\nAudio Kit - essential for those working in audio, sound and music."

      "label": "ThumbJam is a powerful musical performance experience. You get over 40 high-quality real instruments multi-sampled exclusively for this app. Hundreds of included scales allow you to effortlessly play in any style from rock to classical, whether you are a musical novice or a seasoned professional.\n\n---====---\nJordan Rudess, the world-renowned keyboardist for Dream Theater says:\n\n\"ThumbJam stands at the very top of the overcrowded music app world. The sounds included absolutely rival those found in pro instruments and making music on the app is a total joy. The only problem I have with this app is that I did not make it myself! Luckily, I'm able to work with the developer and offer a few good feature ideas as well as some choice sounds from my personal collection!\"\n---======----\n\nEven if you've only played air guitar, ThumbJam lets you sound like a pro.  Pick an instrument and jam -- with all the scales to choose from you'll never hit a wrong note. The high quality instrument samples will make you sound like you just skipped years of music lessons.\n\nFor the performing musician, this app is awesome for soloing on an instrument you didn't bring along.  Play in any key, any style -- go from a string ensemble to a wailing guitar. ThumbJam was developed and tested by musicians to feel and sound like a real instrument. You'll be surprised at how expressive it can be, make sure to check out the videos and audio at thumbjam.com.\n\nThumbJam makes use of tilt and shake to add vibrato, tremolo, note bends, and volume swells for more realistic and expressive results. It supports up to five (eleven on iPad) simultaneous touches and up to 32 voice polyphony, for each of up to 8 loaded instruments!  Delay and stereo reverb add depth to the sound, and a resonant lowpass filter gives you more tone shaping power. Put on your headphones or plug in to your home stereo to experience some of the highest quality instruments in the App Store, even  after all these years!\n\nBuild your own loops from the ground up or import your favorites and jam from there. Layer as many loops as you want, with different instruments for each. Export your loops as audio files via WiFi.  Copy and paste audio from other apps using AudioCopy/Paste as well the general pasteboard, via email, AudioShare, iTunes Document Sharing, Files, or open directly in another application. Supports Audiobus and InterApp Audio for streaming sound to/from other apps in real-time, including state save/restore with Audiobus 3.\n\nExtensive MIDI input and output support over WiFi or Bluetooth, with any CoreMidi compatible device, or other apps on the same iOS device with virtual MIDI. Now also supports Ableton Link for tight sync between apps on the same network. Supports MPE input and output (and did so before it was even a thing)!\n\nNew powerful arpeggiator feature lets you play patterns with perfect time sync, from the screen or via MIDI control.\n\nThe app includes a huge variety of scales, from western to eastern. Save your favorites for quick access, or create your own in-app. You can even import new scales in the Scala format for complete flexibility.\n\nYou can also record your own multi-sampled instruments using a built-in or attached microphone, or from file import.  \n\nIncluded instruments:\n  \n  + Cello, Violin, Viola\n  + Upright Bass (plucked and bowed)\n  + Several drumkits\n  + Darabukka\n  + Djembe\n  + Electric Guitar\n  + Electric Bass\n  + Trumpet\n  + Trombone\n  + Tenor Sax\n  + Flute\n  + Low Whistle\n  + Acoustic Guitar\n  + Hammered Dulcimer\n  + Mandolin\n  + Cittern\n  + Grand Piano\n  + Drawbar Organ (2 types)\n  + Rhodes\n  + Pipe Organ\n  + Synth Strings\n  + Synth Choir\n  + Theremin\n  + Sawtooth Waveform\n  + Sine Waveform\n  + Triangle Waveform\nAnd from Jordan Rudess:\n  + JR Zendrix\n  + JR Smooth Steel \n\nMany more for immediate FREE download in the app including several drumkits, Mellotron, basses, banjo, tabla, ukelele, guitars and more!

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

Rock on!!!\" Ge Wang, Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Creative Officer of Smule (creators of Magic Piano) \n\n\"Jordan's very capable use of his unique invention- MorphWiz must be a Godsend to his road crew. It's important to note that no Moog synthesizers were harmed in its production.\" \nKeith Emerson. \n\n\"It's completely awesome and inspiring to play! \nAbsolutely loving it!\" \nEric Persing-Spectrasonics \n\nMorphWiz is the second app to bear the Jordan Rudess name. MorphWiz is partly inspired by the Haken Continuum Fingerboard, a radically innovative and revolutionary MIDI instrument that Jordan uses on stage and in the studio with Dream Theater. \n\nLike the Continuum, Jordan Rudess' MorphWiz is a vertical grid based musical instrument that allows a whole new level of expressive control! \n\nIf you're a beginner, you’ll love experimenting with all of the presets, but if you’re a professional musician, you will soon be blown away by one of the coolest methods of controlling sound that you've ever laid hands on. \n\nJordan states, “Our goal was to create an instrument that would allow the seamless morphing of the audio and visual domain while delivering a seamless musical experience. I believe the iPhone/iPad multitouch platform opens up a whole new world of creation of electronic musical instruments and we’re proud MorphWiz is our first major offering. My experience and involvement with the Haken Continuum and extraordinary Bebot app brought to life an advanced pitch control system that is still uncharted territory for many in today’s music instrument world. This is the heart of MorphWiz.” \n\nMorphWiz video tutorials: \nhttp://www.morphwiz.com/tutorial.html \n\nOver 80 Jordan Rudess-created patches \n\nFEATURES: \n\n• Assign audio waveforms as visual shapes to the grid and morph between them with your fingers on the grid or the accelerometer \n• Advanced pitch control allows the player to round the pitch of the initial attack of any note. It also recognizes when your finger stops after a slide, and rounds your notes to the nearest diatonic pitch \n• Rounding pitch on initial attack and/or after a slide \n• Independent control for up to 10 simultaneous notes \n• Finger Vibrato Effect (FVE) where you can achieve vibrato even when lock pitch is selected and the pitch is snapping to the grid! \n• Velocity Controlled Animation (VCA) in sync with your musical performance \n• Trippy full-color, animated particles, fire, and ring effects visually radiate under your fingertips and contain real time pitch information \n• Choose from a wide variety of scales and chords to assign to the playing surface with easy customization \n• Choose to display names of notes or intervals to help guide you \n• Performance controls include octave shift, pitch lock on/off, record to delay buffer on/off, infinity delay setting on/off, and multi-function slider \n• Unison detuning effect with separate pan control for that classic analog thickness \n• FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis can be assigned to the vertical grid or accelerometer \n• Wave Sync Synthesis (WSS) can also be assigned to the vertical grid or accelerometer \n• Adjustable note attack and release time \n• FX include digital delay, stereo chorus, and tremolo\n\n“Check out Jordan Rudess’s new album with Steve Horelick entitled “interSonic”which features MorphWiz!”"

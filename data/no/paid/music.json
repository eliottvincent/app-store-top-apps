I appen blir barna tatt med inn i en magisk eventyrskog hvor mørket faller på. Det er mange trette små skapninger som gjemmer seg i skogen og som ikke får sove før feen Syngeling har sunget en nattasang for dem. Kan du finne alle dyrene slik at Syngeling kan synge dem i søvn?\n\nTil hver sang finnes det mange rare instrumenter og lyder du kan trykke på, og som spiller vakkert med til melodiene. På denne måten kan hver sang høres forskjellig ut hver gang du spiller den av.\n\nNår alle dyrene i eventyrskogen har sovnet er det barnet sin tur til å sove.\n\nBarna kan utforske eventyrskogen på et trygt fang, eller helt på egenhånd da appen er spesielt tilpasset de yngste barnas motoriske nivå.\n\n\nDETTE FÅR DU:\n\n11 kjente og kjære godnattsanger sunget på norsk. Håndtegnet av illustratør Cecilie Ellefsen og flott animert i et vakkert skogsmiljø:\n\nBlinke blinke stjerne lill / Trollmors vuggesang / Den lille Ole med paraplyen / Brahms vuggesang / Byssan Lull / Kjære gud / Hvem kan segla / Vi har en tulle / Sulla meg litt / Blåmann / Sov du vesle spire ung\n\n\nBARN LÆRER SPRÅK GJENNOM SANG\n\nVisste du at mange barn synger og bruker språket fra sangtekster lenge før de produserer eget språk? Språkforskere finner stadig flere sammenhenger mellom sang- og språkutvikling hos små barn. Når barna synger trener de på å uttale ord og setninger uten at de opplever dette som trening. Sang- og musikkaktiviteter gjør barn tryggere på språk, og SYNG kan nettopp være et nyttig hjelpemiddel for å gjøre det enkelt og gøy å synge barnesanger.\n\n\nVI VIL HØRE DIN MENING\n\nDin mening er viktig for oss! Send oss gjerne en tilbakemelding på hvordan vi kan gjøre SYNG enda bedre for deg og de små menneskene i livet ditt:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/syngapp/\n\nInstagram: @syng_app\n\nWeb: https://www.syng-app.no/\n\nSupport: games@stormfilms.no\n\nLiker du SYNG setter vi enormt pris på en hyggelig omtale i App Store!\n\nSYNG meg i søvn er utviklet av Storm Films med støtte fra Norsk Filminstitutt og Viken Filmsenter"

      "label": "Simple banjo tuner to tune up your banjo. This is for a standard 5-string Banjo, in gDGBd tuning.\n\nTuning your banjo can be a difficult task for you if you are just beginning banjo. The good news is, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. A nicely tuned banjo can make your music sound a lot better and help you greatly while you're are just getting the hang of finger placement for notes.\n\nTouch the note for the string you want to tune and then turn the tuning pegs on your banjo and match it up with the note that is being played.\n\nNote: For those of you who are beginners and don't understand the tuning of a banjo. The banjo tuning is unique because the last string is actually higher in pitch then the rest of the strings. So for those of you who are wondering whats up with this tuner - it's normal.\n\nTip: Make several passes tuning each of the strings. For example you might have noticed that if you have tuned all the strings once, and then back to the first one you tuned, it might be off a little bit. This is because you are increasing or decreasing the tension on each of the strings as you tune it and the instrument's body might bend ever so slightly due to this difference in tension. This causes the other strings to slightly change in pitch. So make sure you keep on checking and tuning the strings until all are in tune, so make several passes.\n\nFor more information on how to tune Banjo visit:\nhttp://www.tuneinstrument.com/howto/tune/banjo.html\n\nAny questions using the App? Write support@tuneinstrument.com and we we'll get back to you promptly.\n\nIf you need to tune other instruments just simply have a look into our other applications: Cello Tuner Simple, Banjo Tuner Simple, Mandolin Tuner Simple, Double Bass Tuner Simple, 12-String Guitar Tuner Simple, Viola Tuner Simple, Guitar Tuner Simple, Ukulele Tuner Simple, Bass Tuner Simple, Dulcimer Tuner Simple, Dulcimer Tuner Simple Mixolydian, Dulcimer Tuner Ionian, Balalaika Tuner Simple.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @tuneinstrument\nLike us on Facebook: facebook.com/tuneinstrument\nFollow us on Google+: tuneinstrument\nSubscribe to YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/tuneInstrument\nSign up for newsletter and or visit us: www.tuneinstrument.com"

It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

      "label": "Way more than a metronome, the Time Trainer adds five training tools to help you develop your own internal sense of time!\n\nThis is an accurate and stable metronome (many metronome apps out there are not) and features:\n• tap tempo (to work out tempos by tapping a button),\n• countdown timer (for keeping your practice to schedule!)\n• many different sounds (you like cowbell, wood or xylophone?)\n• accent control (for odd time playing)\n• visual metronome movement with a flash on the beat\n• vibrate option (on each beat or just accent)\n\n...but then we add to that with five training tools which will really help you develop your own time feel - essential for all musicians!\n\n• Bar Breaks • will mute the metronome for a bar or more forcing you to keep your time solid and be perfectly synchronized when the clicks return! This is a superb exercise and will really help develop confidence in holding your tempo. You can adjust how many bars are solid at the start then how many bars are solid and how many bars are muted which will cycle for the duration of the session. You can also select \"random\" mode and a % of bars (that you set) that will be dropped for an even more challenging practice session!\n\n• Random Beat Drop • does exactly what it says on the tin... some of the beats (clicks) will be muted at random, forcing you to be confident with your time and not rely on the click too much. Many people chase the beat or try and anticipate it, and this exercise will help you stop those bad habits! I've personally found that the \"gradual\" setting is most useful, a five minute session starting at 100% with more and more beats muted up to the % that you set.\n\n• Speed Up • is a tool I have wanted for years for my own practice so now I made one. Often when working on scales, arpeggios or licks you want to start at an easy speed where you are playing it 100% correctly and gradually push your technique by playing it faster and faster. With this tool you set a start tempo, end tempo and duration of you practice session and off you go, no more stopping to bump the bpm up a few notches every minute!\n\n• Step Upper • Many people requested that we make a programmable mode, most likely to be used to be able to move from one consistent tempo to another, rather than the gradual increase you get in the Speed Upper. You can program a tempo for X number of bars OR minutes :)\n\n• Subdivisions • Another heavily requested feature was to add in subdivisions for those that need to hear them, and for super slow tempo's where having subdivisions can be really helpful!\n\nI'm sure you will find all of the tools very useful, and of course you will find full support on the justinguitar community forum - please take the time to rate and review it, good things will help promote it and anything negative will help me improve it!\n\nWishing you many happy hours of practice :) Justin"

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever. For more information about Audiobus, visit http://audiob.us/"

On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

      "label": "One of the original buffer effects, and still one of the best, Replicant is essentially a randomized looper/buffer reverse, with a randomized stutter effect inside the loop. From a simple delay or panning effect, on up to massive random \"instant Autechre\" beat mangling, Replicant is a capable plugin well in line with today's electronic music styles. Stuttering buffers and filter drops are easy to program, and the comprehensive randomization features give it a mind of its own, if so desired. If you're looking to add some chance to your production, you've come to the right place! \n\nIMPORTANT!!!! PLEASE READ!!!\n\nReplicant 2 is a tempo-based effect, and requires a host that provides transport information. A standalone application is supplied, but it requires an Inter-App Audio connection to a host with a transport to work. We strongly advise using the (identical) AUv3 instead. We recommend BeatMaker 3, AUM, Cubasis, ModStep, GarageBand, AudioBus 3, and similar AUv3 hosts that have a transport. \n\nAnd finally, we have made an iPhone version available for cross-compatibility, but note that the controls are very small. It can be difficult to use in this context, and we do not recommend it. \n\nReplicant 2 is an aggressive buffer-rearranger. It is primarily meant for percussive straight-time material such as drum loops. If the track has a lot of swing, we suggest using loop sizes no smaller than 1/8, as shorter times will nip off the front of the off-beat slices. Furthermore, on legato material Replicant 2 will inevitably choose slice times that contain non-zero-crossing samples. Hence, you will hear clicking on duller material with long decays. This is expected and known. It is a glitch effect. :-) \n\nReplicant 2 for iOS is otherwise identical to our Replicant 2 desktop plugin. Visit the Audio Damage website for audio samples, a video overview, and a full manual. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n» Tempo-based delay and looping effects, from 1/128th note to an entire measure. \n\n» Stutter adds further subdivisions, down to a 1/16384th note (otherwise known as a \"tone\".) \n\n» Seven independant randomization controls, for subtle changes or extreme aleatoric madness, including a global randomize button.\n\n» Our unique \"Hold\" feature, to store a random sequence you like.\n\n» Resonant low-pass and high-pass filters that change over time.\n\n» Pan position that changes over time.\n\n» Two separate direction modes, for entire events or individual repeats, with randomization.\n\n» Front panel triggering of loop events for live playing of effects."

Also included is a stand-alone application with Inter-App Audio. \n\nEos 2 consists of four high-quality custom-designed reverb algorithms, made with the modern production environment in mind. Three different plate simulators and our own Superhall algorithm give you a broad palette of reverb, and the easy-to-understand interface makes adjusting the algorithms to suit your track incredibly simple. \n\nWant a traditional dark plate reverb? Eos 2 can do that. How about a short, dense room sound for your drum buss? Not a problem. But where Eos 2 really comes in to its own is when you drop Superhall on your piano or synthesizer tracks. The incredibly long modulated hall sounds of Eno-style ambience are where Eos 2 thrives, something that is not possible with convolution 'verbs. \n\nFeatures\n\n> Four reverb algorithms designed for Audio Damage by ValhallaDSP, including three separate plate algorithms and our own unique SuperHall, a rich, densely modulated, extra-long hall algorithm designed for ambient and synthesizer music. \n\n> Full control over the reverb early reflections and tail, with modulation and equalization control, to sculpt the density and tonal characteristics to your needs. \n\n> All presets from the desktop version included, and you can even share presets among all versions of Eos 2 using the copy/paste mechanism. \n\n> AUv3 and IAA standard. \n\n> Note that Eos 2 is a dense, heavily modulated algorithmic reverb, and as such may be somewhat heavy on the CPU, especially on older devices.

      "label": "Spring Reverb models the sound and character of popular spring reverbs found in guitar amplifiers, popularized by Surf, Garage and Rockabilly music. Spring takes this a step further by allowing manipulation of physical parameters not normally available in a real spring tank. The results vary from faithful recreations of real springs to distinctive new sounds that push the physical boundaries of reverb. Guitarists love the revered surfer vibe but all creative musicians will find that Spring makes any synthesizer, drum, or vocal stand out in a mix. \n\nThis vintage reverb sound originally derived from the reflections of sound waves traveling through springs has been given an overhaul for the 21st century and beyond. Eventide Spring contains two different sized ‘spring tanks’ along with the ability to morph between one and three springs. Easily program The Ribbon to seamlessly transition between any two settings in real-time! The added tube-amp-style tremolo can be routed before or after the spring resulting in an unrivaled ability to craft your own unique reverb sound. Alter the intensity by changing the tremolo depth and adjust the tremolo rate in Hz, or note value when tempo-synced to your project.\n\nFeatures:\n- Artist presets by Matt Lange, Nick Hook, and Nu-Trix.\n- Tempo Sync reverb decay to your DAW\n- Craft original sounds by changing the number of springs and damping frequency\n- Alter overall resonance by selecting the size of the spring tank \n- Tube-amp-style tremolo that can be routed pre- or post-reverb\n- Create chorus-like effects by altering Modulation Level\n- The Ribbon controller allows for dynamic modification of several knobs at once to easily morph between settings\n- Programmable Hotswitch provides the ability to jump instantly to an alternate sound at the push of a button\n- iOS version works as a standalone app, AudioUnit v3 effect, or Inter-App Audio effect"

On iOS, all sounds can be tuned to your preferred frequency (due to technical limitations fine tuning is only available when using the Tone sound option on Apple Watch).

      "label": "Ribn is a MIDI controller with 8 assignable ribbons. What makes Ribn unique is its ability to record and loop your finger movement. This allows you to add organic repeating modulation to your synths and effects, kind of like complex LFOs. You can assign a unique MIDI channel and CC# to each ribbon. As long as your gear responds to MIDI CC messages you will be able to control it with Ribn.\n\n** FEATURES **\n• 8 MIDI CC ribbon pads\n• Add modulation to your MIDI hardware synths, effects, eurorack modulars, drum machines, etc.\n• Configurable MIDI channel and CC# per ribbon\n• You can name each ribbon to help you identify what parameter it's controlling\n• Turn off looping on individual ribbons to turn them into regular sliders\n• Choose any number of ribbons between 1 and 8\n• Full screen mode (removes navigation bar to help you focus)\n• Switch between 3 sets of configurations using presets\n• MIDI sending works while the app is in the background\n• iPad landscape mode\n• Select multiple MIDI outputs\n• Ribbons record and loop your finger movement\n• Use a wired MIDI interface, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi\n• All settings are saved automatically\n• Works with external hardware as well as other iOS synths\n• Works on iPhone (including iPhone X) and iPad starting with iOS 10\n\n** EXAMPLE USES **\n• Control hardware MIDI synths parameters like the filter cutoff frequency, resonance, oscillator octave, etc.\n• Control any soft synth in Ableton Live (or your favorite DAW) by connecting your iOS device to your Mac via Wi-Fi and choosing \"Session 1\" as the MIDI output in Ribn.\n• Control your Eurorack modules by running Ribn through a MIDI to CV converter.\n• Control other iOS synths like the Moog Model 15 or Arturia iSEM.\n• Control drum machines and effects. For example, try controlling the room size of a reverb effect unit with a looping ribbon or the snappiness of a snare drum on a drum machine. The possibilities are endless.\n• Daisy chain your MIDI hardware using MIDI Thru ports and assign each ribbon to a different MIDI channel. This way you can control more than one piece of hardware at a time. For example, you can assign the first 4 ribbons to a synth and the last 4 to an effect unit. \n\n** HOW IT WORKS **\n• Connect your MIDI gear (like a synth) to your iOS device using a MIDI interface (wired or bluetooth)\n• Launch Ribn and select your MIDI interface in the settings page.\n• Find out which CC# and MIDI channel your gear responds to (usually at the end of the manual) and enter this information in RIbn's edit view.\n• Slide your finger on a ribbon to send CC values and control the parameters on your MIDI gear.\n\n** WHAT IS MIDI AND CC? **\n• MIDI is just the way electronic musical instruments talk to each other. \n• CC (Continuous Controller) is just a way to control various parameters using MIDI.  For example, a synth's filter cutoff frequency can be controlled using a MIDI CC signal.\n\n** NOTE **\n• Ribn is a MIDI controller and doesn't produce any sounds. To use Ribn you must connect it to a device that responds to MIDI CC signals (check your gear's manual to be sure).\n• Ribn doesn't send note data, it only sends CC signals (you can't play melodies with it, but you can control various parameters like synthesizer filters, or effects settings).\n• To connect your iOS device to MIDI gear you will need to buy a MIDI interface. A MIDI interface typically connects to your iOS lightning port and provides standard MIDI DIN ports to connect to your hardware. There are also bluetooth MIDI interfaces that connect wirelessly. Alternatively, you can connect to your Mac over Wi-Fi and control software synths that way. This setup is a little more complex but totally doable (I've tested controlling Ableton Live plugins over Wi-Fi with Ribn and it worked perfectly).\n• Audiobus and AUv3 are not supported at this time. However, you can still control other iOS synths by routing the internal MIDI ports and having Ribn run in the background."

You can even create dynamic controls (e.g. Program Change values that count up or down).\n\n• Works with every macOS: From 10.5 (Leopard) up to the newest 10.15 (Catalina)\n• Works on every iPhone and iPad\n• Also works with external hardware (e.g. synths,...) that supports Apple (CoreMidi)\n• If your hardware/PC does not support CoreMidi, you can use an iPhone/iPad compatible MIDI-Interface as bridge to make MidiController work with ALL MIDI devices\n\nWorks with every application that supports MIDI-Input.\nExample DAWs (Digital Audio Workstation):\n* Logic X Pro\n* Ableton Live\n* Avid Pro Tools\n* Propellerhead Reason\n* Steinberg Cubase\n* Cockos Reaper\n* and many more (in principle every application that supports midi input)\n\n** NOTES **\n• MidiController does not play any sound itself, it only sends out MIDI-Information to connected devices.\n• MidiController is primary created to work with macOS-Devices. If you want to use MidiController with hardware that does not support Apple CoreMidi, you might need an iPhone/iPad compatible MIDI-Interface as bridge. A MIDI interface typically connects to your iOS per lightning port and provides standard MIDI DIN ports to connect to your hardware. There are also bluetooth MIDI interfaces that connect wirelessly.\n• MidiController does not receive any MIDI-Information, it generates and sends them itself depending on the user-input."

      "label": "Undulator is Eventide’s classic modulated tremolo effect from the iconic H3000 effects processor. This unique, rhythmic effect combines ethereal feedback and detuned echos, run through an AM / FM modulated tremolo. Whether used for manipulating samples or adding movement to strings, pads, guitars, and keys, Undulator is a muse for creative musicians. Add Undulator into your plug-ins collection for the most playable tremolo-style effect on your DAW or iOS device.\n\nUndulator excels at evolving pads, sync’d chops, and time-lapsing dreamy soundscapes. Combined with a multi-tap delay and powerful tremolo, Undulator’s controls give any sound sustain and shape. This is perfect for transforming ordinary synths, keys, guitars, and even vocals into evolving pads, tempo synced production elements, or ethereal and fluctuant delays. Simply put, Undulator can make shorter sounds into longer layered effects, and give sustaining sounds shape and rhythmic character.\n\nUse the Ribbon to morph tremolo patterns into vacillating and varying rhythmic territories. This can be effective for calling attention to synth pads and creating a state of flux or rarity which is otherwise arduous to achieve.\n\n- Turn up the MIX to increase the dry/effect ratio\n- Utilize multiple modulation waveform shapes and sources to alter the rhythmic feel\n- Subtly finesse detuning of delays by using SPREAD\n- Add FEEDBACK to accentuate delays or create infinite loops\n- The Secondary LFO determines how fast the depth and speed modulation “wiggle” their targets\n- Lock the tremolo to tempo using SYNC\n- RETRIG at the top of the waveform for a more predictable effect\n- RIBBON lets you ‘play’ the effect in real-time and provides dynamic and fluid control to morph back and forth between the settings of your choice\n- SLOW/FAST button toggles on a “Slow LFO” mode. Holding it down to “BRAKE” temporarily slows down the LFOs at a constant rate until released\n- Update the tremolo speed in real time using the TAP button\n- Available as an AUv3 plug-in and Standalone App"

Du vil sannsynligvis finne ut at du slett ikke trenger å kjøpe ny DAB-radio likevel.\n\nDu får ALLE norske radiokanaler på ett sted:\n • Kanalene som er borte fra FM\n • Kanalene som fortsatt er på FM\n • Lokalradioer som er utenfor rekkevidde på FM\n • Nettradioer som aldri har vært på FM\n • Alle DAB-kanalene\n\nAppen koster:\n • Bare en brøkdel av en knotete DAB-adapter\n • Nesten ingenting i forhold til en ny bilstereo\n • Omtrent det samme som ei pølse på bensinstasjonen\n\nAppen er optimalisert for bruk i bil:\n • Mer trafikksikker enn en bilstereo, DAB-adapter eller andre radio-apper\n • Store, tydelige knapper\n • Bare dine utvalgte favorittkanaler\n • Kommuniserer med din eksisterende bilstereo/rattkontroll\n • Ingen forstyrrende elementer\n\nFlere bruksområder enn bilstereoen! Siden du fortsatt har med deg appen når du forlater bilen, kan du også bruke den:\n • I en dockingstasjon på jobben\n • Med hodetelefoner på trening/tur\n • Koblet til stereoanlegget hjemme\n\nAndre fordeler:\n • Du kan lytte til norske radiokanaler også når du er i utlandet. De fleste mobilabonnementer lar deg bruke mobildata på samme vilkår i EU/EØS som i Norge.\n • Lydkvaliteten er like god, og i mange tilfeller bedre enn DAB+, fordi DAB har begrenset båndbredde som må fordeles mellom kanalene, mens de i denne appen alltid spilles i full kvalitet.\n • I mange tunneler der DAB-radioen bryter, spiller denne appen uten problemer.\n\nHvor mye mobildata vil det kreve å bruke denne appen?\n1 GB gir ca. 18 timer med radiolytting. \nPå et typisk mobilabonnement, med 3 GB mobildata inkludert per måned, vil de aller fleste ha mer enn nok mobildata til å bruke appen hver gang de kjører bil.\nNår du er tilkoblet WiFi-nettet hjemme eller på jobb, bruker du ingen mobildata."

SynthStation transforms your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad into a portable music production studio for mobile music creation. SynthStation gives you three powerful synthesizers for creating and modifying sonic textures used for melodies, chords, and bass lines. Built around Akai Professional’s history in synthesis and drawing on the newest MINIAK synth, SynthStation sounds great and offers wide-ranging sonic flexibility with its virtual analog synthesis.\n\nFrom the moment you start SynthStation, you'll know your way around. It is jam-packed with tools to help you create music with the convenience of your touch screen and each section works the way you work. With SynthStation, you can create and save sequences and complete songs. The app contains three different three-oscillator synths and a range of drum kits you can sequence and mix right in the SynthStation. For creating melodic and accompaniment parts, the SynthStation contains an arpeggiator with preset patterns, built-in effects and filters, and an XY touch control interface for expressive control of key parameters.\n\nPERFORM\nPlay with keys, XY and arpeggiator controls. This is perfect place to make magic happen because it gives you access to all the common controls you’ll need in a performance or creation setting.\n\nSYNTH\nComplete synthesis controls from oscillators to LFOs, envelopes, and more. You can control a wide range of filters to dial in exactly the sound you need. Choose from Sine, Triangle, Square or Sawtooth on your VCO and start creating your own signature sounds from scratch. Filter Cutoff and Resonance are just two taps away.\n\nDRUMS\nIn addition to SynthStation's three synthesizers, we've included drum kits and a visual representation of the most iconic beat making tool in the world - MPC pads.

Just like a joystick, the XY controller can snap back to the zero point.\n\nTempo – control tempo and even tap in the tempo you want.\n\nMIXER\nThe Mixer in SynthStation includes touch-controlled faders for each of the three synthesizers and the drum section as well as FX send for each. \n\nMixer – mix all the levels of the parts and effects. Just like a hardware mixer, there are faders, mutes, and effect routing.\n\nEffects – select and control FX type and parameters.\n\nSynthStation Studio enables you to create and produce music anywhere on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad."

Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

A real time Spectrum Analyser, a Scope to display waveforms, an SPL (Sound Pressure Level) Meter, and a Signal Generator producing sine waves, white noise and pink noise. Sweep generation with In App Purchase.\n \n-View a real time spectrum of audio with the Spectrum Analyser and identify peak frequencies precisely\n\n -View the actual waveform of the audio signal with the Scope \n\n -An SPL Meter provides measurement of sound levels using an A-weighting\n\n -The Signal Generator provides a sine wave output up to 20,000Hz in 1 Hz steps, along with noise generators for white and pink noise. Sweep generation with In App Purchase\n\n** Spectrum  **\n\nFFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is used to calculate the frequencies in the Spectrum Analyser and these are displayed in real time. The frequency is displayed in either logarithmic or linear scale.\n\nThree FFT sizes of 8192, 4096 and 2048 are selectable, giving fine resolution of frequencies. Interpolation gives resolution to within 1Hz.\n\n 6 different FFT window function types can be selected - Hamming, Hann, Rectangular, Bartlett, Triangular and Blackman.   \n\nNumber of FFT windows can be selected from 1 through 4.\n\nThe strongest frequency is displayed both above the peak, and optionally, in a large number display in the center of the screen. The large number display can be quickly switched on or off by double tapping the screen. \n\nThere is a screen capture facility in the Spectrum Analyser allowing you to save the spectra  for future reference along with details of the FFT parameters, time and date.  \n\nA single tap freezes the screen. Other features such as screen capture and double tap to toggle large number display still work during the freeze. This feature can be turned off in preferences if it’s not desired. \n\n** Scope ** \n\nThe display of the Scope can be adjusted easily using pinch gestures in both horizontal and vertical directions. Zero crossing detection of the waveform provides a smooth display and can be set to either positive or negative direction zero crossing.\n\n  There is a screen capture facility in the Scope allowing you to save waveforms for future reference. \n\n** SPL Meter ** \n\n The SPL Meter continuously displays the sound pressure level using an A-weighting, and has resettable minimum and maximum displays also. \n\nSPL Meter can be calibrated against a reference standard or meter.\n\nSPL Meter has a continuous ticker style trace of the SPL over time. \n\n** Signal Generator ** \n  \nThe Signal Generator has 3 different output types: \n\n- Sine wave \n- White noise \n- Pink noise \n\n The output of the Signal Generator can be viewed on the other parts of the App.  \n\nThe sine wave frequency selected using picker wheels allows for accurate control of frequency to within 1Hz. Volume for the sine wave and noise signals is continuously adjustable.  \n\nWith an In App Purpose one can add a sine wave sweep generator functionality to the Signal Generator. The sweep generator can sweep increasing and decreasing frequencies, and using either a linear or log sweep rate.\n\n**Settings  **\n\nAll of the user preferences in each of the above applications can be made persistent between restarts of the App. \n\nAll parts of the App have direct access to a help document. \n\nAudio Kit - essential for those working in audio, sound and music."

      "label": "ThumbJam is a powerful musical performance experience. You get over 40 high-quality real instruments multi-sampled exclusively for this app. Hundreds of included scales allow you to effortlessly play in any style from rock to classical, whether you are a musical novice or a seasoned professional.\n\n---====---\nJordan Rudess, the world-renowned keyboardist for Dream Theater says:\n\n\"ThumbJam stands at the very top of the overcrowded music app world. The sounds included absolutely rival those found in pro instruments and making music on the app is a total joy. The only problem I have with this app is that I did not make it myself! Luckily, I'm able to work with the developer and offer a few good feature ideas as well as some choice sounds from my personal collection!\"\n---======----\n\nEven if you've only played air guitar, ThumbJam lets you sound like a pro.  Pick an instrument and jam -- with all the scales to choose from you'll never hit a wrong note. The high quality instrument samples will make you sound like you just skipped years of music lessons.\n\nFor the performing musician, this app is awesome for soloing on an instrument you didn't bring along.  Play in any key, any style -- go from a string ensemble to a wailing guitar. ThumbJam was developed and tested by musicians to feel and sound like a real instrument. You'll be surprised at how expressive it can be, make sure to check out the videos and audio at thumbjam.com.\n\nThumbJam makes use of tilt and shake to add vibrato, tremolo, note bends, and volume swells for more realistic and expressive results. It supports up to five (eleven on iPad) simultaneous touches and up to 32 voice polyphony, for each of up to 8 loaded instruments!  Delay and stereo reverb add depth to the sound, and a resonant lowpass filter gives you more tone shaping power. Put on your headphones or plug in to your home stereo to experience some of the highest quality instruments in the App Store, even  after all these years!\n\nBuild your own loops from the ground up or import your favorites and jam from there. Layer as many loops as you want, with different instruments for each. Export your loops as audio files via WiFi.  Copy and paste audio from other apps using AudioCopy/Paste as well the general pasteboard, via email, AudioShare, iTunes Document Sharing, Files, or open directly in another application. Supports Audiobus and InterApp Audio for streaming sound to/from other apps in real-time, including state save/restore with Audiobus 3.\n\nExtensive MIDI input and output support over WiFi or Bluetooth, with any CoreMidi compatible device, or other apps on the same iOS device with virtual MIDI. Now also supports Ableton Link for tight sync between apps on the same network. Supports MPE input and output (and did so before it was even a thing)!\n\nNew powerful arpeggiator feature lets you play patterns with perfect time sync, from the screen or via MIDI control.\n\nThe app includes a huge variety of scales, from western to eastern. Save your favorites for quick access, or create your own in-app. You can even import new scales in the Scala format for complete flexibility.\n\nYou can also record your own multi-sampled instruments using a built-in or attached microphone, or from file import.  \n\nIncluded instruments:\n  \n  + Cello, Violin, Viola\n  + Upright Bass (plucked and bowed)\n  + Several drumkits\n  + Darabukka\n  + Djembe\n  + Electric Guitar\n  + Electric Bass\n  + Trumpet\n  + Trombone\n  + Tenor Sax\n  + Flute\n  + Low Whistle\n  + Acoustic Guitar\n  + Hammered Dulcimer\n  + Mandolin\n  + Cittern\n  + Grand Piano\n  + Drawbar Organ (2 types)\n  + Rhodes\n  + Pipe Organ\n  + Synth Strings\n  + Synth Choir\n  + Theremin\n  + Sawtooth Waveform\n  + Sine Waveform\n  + Triangle Waveform\nAnd from Jordan Rudess:\n  + JR Zendrix\n  + JR Smooth Steel \n\nMany more for immediate FREE download in the app including several drumkits, Mellotron, basses, banjo, tabla, ukelele, guitars and more!

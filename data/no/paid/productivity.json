For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

It's a different way of looking at the day\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe visual planner works like an analog clock widget. It automatically receives all the calendar events and overlays them on the 12/24 hour dial. This provides a different, more efficient view of your schedule.\n\nHOW IT LOOKS\n\nIt looks like a projection of your calendar of events onto a 12-hour dial that has hour and minute hands just like a regular watch.\nEvent sectors are displayed in those hour intervals in which they will occur.\nThe interval of idle time between events is displayed between sectors, as well as the time from an hour hand to the start of each event.\nEvents are displayed automatically 12/24 hours ahead of time.\n\nThe calendar and analog clock, combined, give a visual representation of your busyness, allow you to effectively plan and calculate daytime.\n\nUse a widget for better integration.\n\nAREAS OF APPLICATION\n\n• Day scheduling and timing. Conveniently track your daily tasks, meetings, events and at any time know how much time is left to wait until the end of the current event and until the start of the next. Don't be late.\n\n• Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in your workplace and you will be completely under control.\n\n• Class schedule. Observe how much time is left before the end of a tiresome lecture at the university and never be late for laboratory work.\n\n• Schedule of the day. Follow your daily routine and get better, just use the app to keep track of your to-dos and daily tasks. Take rest breaks in time!\n\n• Trip timer and flight duration. Are you losing the passage of time due to endless travel and flights? Control check-in time, boarding time and flight duration. Keep everything under control.\n\n• Make your meal, medication, and exercise schedule clearer. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!\n\n• Convenient countdown to scheduled events in the app and widget. The plan of the day will be executed exactly.\n\n• The app may appeal to fans of Pomodoro and Chronodex timer technologies. Time tracking with him will happen in a new way."

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

      "label": "BimmerLink is the direct link to your BMW or MINI. Using one of the supported OBD adapters you can read trouble codes or display sensor values in realtime, check the current state of the DPF in your car or register a new battery after replacement. BimmerLink even allows you to remotely control the exhaust flap or mute the Active Sound Design in your car.\n\nREAD AND CLEAR TROUBLE CODES\nDiagnose your car as would otherwise be possible only by your Service Partner. In contrast to generic OBD apps that read emission related errors only, BimmerLink allows you to read and clear trouble codes from ALL control units in your car.\n\nDISPLAY REALTIME SENSOR VALUES\nBimmerLink provides a big selection of values like oil temperature or boost pressure. Keep an eye on all the important parameters of your car with a personalized dashboard.\n\nEXHAUST FLAP REMOTE CONTROL*\nTake control over the exhaust flap in your car and decide yourself, whether it should be closed or open.\n\nACTIVE SOUND DESIGN**\nIf you do not like the artificial engine sound generated in your car, just mute the Active Sound Design with BimmerLink.\n\nSOUND TUNING***\nThe “Sound Tuning” option allows you to disable the “exhaust burble“ in cars equipped with the S55 engine (M2 Competition, M3, M4).\n\nDPF REGENERATION****\nBimmerLink allows you to check the current state of the diesel particulate filter in your car. Find out when the last regeneration took place or how much ash has accumulated in the filter and start a regeneration with the touch of a button.\n\nBATTERY REGISTRATION\nIf you want to replace the battery in your car, this has to be registered in the engine control unit and BimmerLink allows you to do this yourself now.\n\nPARKING BRAKE SERVICE MODE\nBimmerLink allows you to activate the service mode for the electromechanical parking brake.\n\nSERVICE RESET\nReset the service display in your car after carrying out maintenance work like a brake pad replacement or an engine oil change.\n\nREQUIRED ACCESSORIES\nTo use the app one of the supported Bluetooth or WiFi OBD adapters or cables is required.

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "WoodMaster is a very handy tool for Woodworkers. Finally a LOADED Woodworking app for Woodworkers. Woodworking apps are few and far between and as being Woodworkers ourselves, we wanted an app for Woodworkers that did much more than simple board foot calculations! Welcome to WoodMaster!\n\nBoth beginners and advanced Woodworkers will find WoodMaster packed with many time-saving features! Check the features list below and you will find a long list useful tools that only WoodMaster includes in a singe app! WoodMaster will continue to grow with more tools being added to each new version release. \n\nFeatures List:\n\nBoard Foot Calculator:\nA board foot calculator that includes a Tally count and Tally cost. Using the Tally feature, you could enter varying sizes of wood stock in groups. For example, enter all 2x4's, add it to the Tally, then 2x6's, add it to the Tally, etc. You can basically use the Tally feature to estimate the cost of an entire woodworking project.\n\nShelf Calculator\nWoodworking Shelf Calculator:\nInstalling shelves for a cabinet, bookcase shelves, etc.? This will calculate spacing between the shelves evenly. Supports inches or millimeters and gives you the exact position of every shelf.\n\nDecking Calculator (NEW!)\nCalculates the number of deck boards required for a given deck section. Up to 3 deck sections supported. Based on standard 5.5 inch deck boards.\n\nFraction Calculator (Sliderule version):\nVery cool method of adding and subtracting fractions without entering any numbers.\n\nFraction Calculator (Numeric):\nAdd fractions including whole numbers.\n\nFraction to Decimal & Millimeter Converter\n\nLength Conversions:\nMost common conversions for Woodworking\n\nProportional Calculator:\nTurn big woodworking projects into little woodworking projects or little woodworking projects into big woodworking projects while maintaining exact proportions. Very handy for enlarging or reducing woodworking dimensions proportionally.\n\nGolden Ratio: \nCalculates the Golden Ratio for any given size to find the most pleasing proportion for your Woodworking projects! \n\nNominal to Actual Size:\nShows the exact measurements of wood based on it's nominal size. Also includes millimeter size.\n\nScrew Size Chart:\nHandy reference chart that includes Gauge, Head-Bore, Shank and Pilot hole sizes for hardwood and software.\n\nNail Size Chart\nHandy reference chart for typical nail sizes.\n\nJoint Types:\nVery handy visual reference for the most common types of joints used in woodworking.\n\nWood Types:\nVery hand visual reference for different types of wood. If you have a sample, send it to us and we'll add it to the list.\n\nKnock-down Sawhorse:\nPlans for building a quick knock-down Sawhorse from a 2x4 and a 1x4. Includes an Outfeeder Attachment plan as well. You can have the WoodMaster app send these plans to your Email address in PDF format.\n\nKnockdown Workbench:\nPlans for building a quick knock-down Workbench from a single 4x8 sheet of plywood. You can have the WoodMaster app send these plans to your Email address in PDF format.\n\nWoodworking Project Planner PDF file:\nA very handy blank Woodworking Project Planner Form. WoodMaster can Email you a Project Planner form that you can print out and use for your next project. The Project Planner form is set up with the most typical information for creating a woodworking project. If you have other planner form ideas, send them to us and we'll include them in a future version. You can have the WoodMaster app send this Project Planner to your Email address in PDF format. \n(Please note that this is not an interactive form (like a database) but a simple form that you can print out and fill in for your projects. We do plan to build an interactive Project Planner that you can fill out right in the app and then send it to your Email address. Stay tuned!)\n\nWe hope that you find WoodMaster as valuable and time-saving as we have!"

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "iPinSafe is the perfect solution if you want to take your secret passwords and PIN codes with you on your iPhone or iPod touch. You can enter and maintain the data either with this app, or with the Mac version of iPinSafe (available on the Mac App Store).\n\nThe app stores the information in a very secure way on your iPhone, and only allows access to someone who can reproduce a specific screen gesture, defined by you.\n\nThe program stores the information with strong encryption, using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Therefore, the only way to access the data is by entering a key, which only you know. There is no \"backdoor\" to get to the information!\n\niPinSafe uses a unique approach for entering the key. You do not have to type a password or a secret number; instead the program lets you define a gesture, in the form of a line pattern that you simply draw on the screen. This approach has a number of advantages:\n- It is faster than typing a password.\n- Being a line pattern, the key is easier to remember than a series of letters and digits.\n- The number of possible gestures is huge, so it is virtually impossible to guess the correct one.\n\nThe encryption key is not stored on the device - only you know the personal gesture. So even if you lose the device, the information is safe.\n\nWhile you draw your secret line pattern, it appears in a small area of the screen, and can even be totally hidden if you wish. If you suspect that an unauthorized person saw you drawing the line pattern, you can easily change it.\n\nWhile accessing your confidential data, you can lock the data instantly by simply turning the device face-down. This clears the screen, and you must enter the gesture again to see the data.\n\nThe program also locks the data if the device is tilted or moved quickly - for example if someone unexpectedly grabs it from your hands.\n\niPinSafe keeps track of the number of times a wrong gesture has been entered. The app supports auto-destruct: if a wrong gesture has been entered too many times in a row, the stored data is destroyed. You can configure the maximum number of attempts yourself."

      "label": "Visualize Your Shift Schedule\n\nFrom Jeff: Please use the in-app email buttons (on the Help tab), or send to sched@buddy.com.  Please don't put questions or suggestions in a review -- there's no way for me to reply directly to you.\n\nIf your schedule varies from week to week, keeping track of your working days can be a chore, and it’s often difficult to quickly figure out when you’ll be on-duty weeks or months in the future.\n\nScheduler to the rescue!  Designed for public-service employees such as police officers, firefighters and health-care workers — anyone who works an unusual but predictable schedule — Scheduler always shows your schedule for the next six years from “today.”  Common shift schedules are built-in, such as the “Berkeley” (a.k.a. “California”), “48-96” and “Dupont,” but you can easily change them or create other repeating schedules covering any number of days.  See the screenshots (here and on the web site) for some examples.  And there’s even a “Doofus” mode for showing irregular schedules (e.g., health-care workers).\n\nIf your spouse/partner works a shift schedule, too, you can have that entirely different rotation appear on the calendar with yours.  This will help you organize family activities such as vacations and day-care.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Displays your schedule for the next six years, including vacations and holidays.\n• Perfect for public-service workers such as police officers and firefighters.\n• Records trades (swaps). Tracks hours earned or owed on a person-by-person basis.\n• Formats emails for sending out trade offers and approval requests.\n• Maintains a record of your OT hours.\n• Tracks your vacation time: automatically computes hours earned and shows weekly balances.  Also records and totals sick time.\n• Logs “events” with date, time and location — you can edit the title, text, and location details when you have time.\n• Overlays an entirely separate schedule for your spouse/partner to help you coordinate your lives.\n• Adjustable colors for shifts, vacations, Kelly days, holidays, etc.\n• Mark special days such as Kellys, paydays, “early” shifts, or training days.\n• Countdown to retirement.\n• Extensive Help pages for every feature and screen; indexed.\n\nNotes:\n1. You *can* enter a custom schedule.\n2. You *can* set the text that appears on each day.\n3. You *can* enter very long rotations.\n4. You *can* superimpose text to mark special days on the calendar.\n5. You *can* set bi-weekly repeating events (e.g., for paydays)\n6. Visit my website (link below) for help and contact info.\n\n8. Scheduler is complicated. Please don't give up and leave a bad review -- I can't help you that way. Contact me at sched@buddy.com (or using the in-app email button on the Help screen) with questions or comments. I reply to all emails immediately (or within a few hours if I'm sleeping or traveling, which isn't often). If you didn't hear from me promptly, it means there was failure in the \"Tubes.\"  Please try again to contact me.\n\nAttention FDNY (firemen): you'll find my other app, FDNY, more useful for FD New York.\n\nAttention: UK bus and train drivers: you might find my other app, UK Rota, more useful."

      "label": "‘Hand Tuber’ is a simple to use tubing offset calculator, and offers the field tubing specialist a handy tool to accurately place stainless instrument or copper tubing bend offsets in the field, utilising its in-built bender library and specialized calculations for both Metric and Imperial measurements.\n\nThis tool has been specifically developed to calculate for all bend angles, and not just 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°, for those times where tubes are required to be run between obstacles such as beams, cable ladders, and pipework.\n\n‘Hand Tuber’ also allows you the benefit of being able to add your own specific Rotary Draw Tube Bender to the bender choices in the library.\n\nImperial and metric benders are included in the inbuilt bender library, and the calculator can be used with both inches and millimeters as a unit of measure with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nIn a Nutshell:\n\n•\tSeven common Tubing Offset calculations included in the program.\n•\tCan be used for most Rotary Draw type benders (Center Line Radius)\n•\tAll results are calculated by using the tube center and/or bender radius.\n•\tAll calculations are based on trigonometry formula giving precision.\n•\tHand Tuber can be set up for either inches or millimeters.\n•\tThe most common Imperial and Metric bender profiles are included.\n•\tAdd new benders in ‘Add Benders’, and build a new bender profile.\n•\tMaintains a History of your previous completed bend calculations.\n•\tHelp screens included for all bend offsets and are quickly accessible.\n•\tMost calculations are completed on a single screen.\n•\tHandy graphics show the calculation results as a visual reference.\n•\tAdjustment, Offset, and Seating Allowance reference charts included.\n•\tHandy standard calculator function within the app.\n•\tEase of navigation to switch pages quickly and directly.\n•\tAccess to Online Tubing Manual via a handy link from the app.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line:\n\nFast on screen calculations, no need to use ‘cast offs’ to find that bend position.\nHelps to save wastage and reduce that ‘Bone Pile’ or stock of ‘Future Bends’.\nSaves time in working out those common and tricky offsets quickly.\nFinds the answer when the ‘Measure then Bend’ technique won’t work.\nVery handy, fits in your pocket or bag on your mobile device.\n\nOffsets and Calculations Included in the Current Release:\n\nSimple Offset: \nThe simple offset calculates the position of the second bend in a standard 2 bend offset, based on the previous Pre-Bent angle and the offset required for any angle between 0° and 90°.\n\nPredictive Offset:\nThe predictive offset calculates the second bend in a standard 2 bend offset, based on the previous planned bend angle, and the required offset, before either bend in the offset has been bent for any angle between 0° and 90°.\n\nParallel Offset:\nThe parallel offset calculates the position adjustment of the bend in a parallel tube, by giving the +/- length needed in order to maintain a consistent spacing between tubes with a change in direction.\n\nLong Run Offset:\nThe Long Run Offset calculates the Slope Length and Bend Angle for long runs of tube with a fixed or known Offset and Run length.\n\nBack Bend Offset:\nThe Back Bend Offset calculates the bender 0° position, for a bend that folds back on itself at an angle greater than 90°. This is useful when running tube on beams and cross braces.\n\nJoint Offset:\nThe Joint offset calculates the measurements and offsets to aid in the positioning of an offset tube joint or connecter in a specific location, and gives the measurements to place the center of the joint.\n\nFall Calculation:\nThe Fall Calculator calculates the fall or Offset amount, over a set distance based on a fall ratio.\nThe usual fall minimum for tubing in instrumentation is 1:12 or 8.33%."

      "label": "Habeets is a simple habit-tracking app designed to help you achieve your goals and create a better version of yourself. If you want to create better habits (workout, eat healthily, save more money, etc), or ditch your bad ones (drinking, smoking, etc), Habeets can help you achieve that. You will still need to do the hard work, though...\n\nCORE VALUES\n- Form or ditch any type of habit\n- Easy to use\n- Packed with all the features you need\n- All your habits are for your eyes only. Neither I nor Apple can read your data.\n- No extra payments, subscriptions, or ads\n- Automatically synchronize your data across all your devices\n- Support for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac (Apple Silicon)\n- Beautifully crafted graphs and insights\n- Dark mode\n- Set reminders\n\n\nMAKE YOUR GOALS A REALITY\nShows how far you've come and how much you've improved. Encourages you to keep going when things get tough. Finally, break those bad habits that have been holding you back for years\n\nSIMPLE, EASY, AND FAST\nHabeets is a straightforward, simple, and elegant solution to help you in your journey, that will become part of your day.\n\nIMPROVE EVERY DAY\nTrack days that you missed or skipped, and make it work next time.\nForm all types of recurring habits: Weekly, Interval, and Customized.\n\nNO EXTRA PAYMENTS\nI believe that helping you achieve your goals is more important than anything else. Nowadays almost every app requires subscriptions or they just have ads everywhere.\nHabeets doesn't have any premium features. You'll receive all features already unlocked. No subscriptions, no additional payments, or ads.\nPay once, and use forever. That's it.\nHelping you become better and better by using this app is what matters to me.\n\nYOUR PRIVACY MATTERS\nHabeets is focused on privacy. We don't track you or your habits. We don't send any data to 3rd parties. Your habits data never leaves your phone or its iCloud backups. None of your habits data is saved to a server (except iCloud's servers).\n\nREMINDERS\nGo mind-free all day setting reminders for your habits. Set up an alarm for when you need to do something important like drink water or meditate. You'll never miss a chance to keep moving forward.\n\nANYTIME. ANYWHERE\nI designed Habeets so you can use it anytime, anywhere. From your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch. This will help you continue your habits wherever you go.\nFor example, you can use your Apple Watch to track habits when your iPhone is not around.\nAll your data is encrypted and automatically synched throught all your devices.\n\n\n\"Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\" - James Clear (Atomic Habits)\n\nThank you for reading until here. I wish you nothing but the best in your journey.\n\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://habeets.com/privacy-policy/"

Sun Finder gives a simple answer to the questions “How long is there sun on this deck you are about to buy?” and “Will it really be sunny 3 months from now?”. \n\nAlso try our new free app \"Wiki GO\".\n\nRecommended by BBC Click on 22/11, 2014.\n\nSun Finder lets you see where the sun will be anywhere in the world, at any time of year, any time of the day. The Augmented Reality overlays the sun on the camera screen. You can directly see if the neighboring house hides the sun in the garden you are considering!\n\nThe app has two modes: \n\n• Find the sun position for a given date and time\n• Find at which time of the day and at which angle the sun appears in a given direction. Ensure you place the table correctly for your next romantic sunset dinner.\n\nTurn your phone sideways to immediately view the sun with Augmented Reality.  Document your findings by taking a geotagged picture.\n\nThis App doesn't need an internet connection. It only requires to know your location. \n\nSun Finder relies on the compass and GPS of your device. Best results are achieved if you are outside (with Wi-Fi and cellular data switched off). Note that using a protective cover on your phone might interfere with the compass.\n\nOne way to calibrate the compass is to move the phone in an 8-number manner 3 times: Once when the phone is in landscape, once in portrait and once facing up. Also stay away from magnetic sources that might influence the compass."

Alle endringer synkroniseres mellom enhetene og ingen spesielle innstillinger som kreves. Du kjøper en app som fungerer på både iPhone og iPad.\n  \nHvorfor Min uke?\n\n• Clean design uten unødvendig distraksjon - dine hendelser er i fokus\n\n• Naturligvis enkel navigering mellom tilstøtende uker, sveip til høyre eller venstre\n\n• Klar presentasjon av hendelser i kalenderen - i motsetning til mange andre kalenderappar enten viser et vanskelig å lese listen eller bare har plass til noen hendelser i kalenderen, mens resten er ikke synlig i hovedvisningen\n\n• Muligheten til å enkelt legge til nye hendelser ved å peke på dato - ikke nødvendig å taste inn dato manuelt\n\n• Lyn rask navigering til fjerne uker - pek ukenummeret i kalenderen for å se alle hendelsene for den valgte uken\n\n• Viser alle norske faste og bevegelige helligdager og flaggdager til 2030\n\n• Viser alle norske navnedager\n\n• Gantt diagram inspirert syn som bare gir deg en oversikt over dine hendelser, selv de som overlapper eller er i gang i flere dager\n\n• Ikke behov for tungvinte, forvirrende eller unødvendige innstillinger - \"Less is more\". Du lærer raskt å bruke app funksjoner.\n  \nApp består av to klaffer. Den første viser dine hendelser i form av en tidslinje for hver dag i uken, og lar deg bla frem og tilbake mellom uke ved å berøre og dra fingeren til venstre eller høyre. Ønsker du å legge til en ny hendelse, trykk den tilsvarende dagen i listen. Du kan også endre eller slette en eksisterende hendelse ved å berøre den. Hvis du trykker ukenummer skiftes uke-visning til dag-visning, og du kan begynne å bla gjennom dagene i uken som du har valgt.\n   \nDen andre klaffen viser deg alle de månedene og ukene som begynner og slutter i måneden. Det gir deg også oversikt over navnedager, norske flotte helgedager innen år 2030. Vil du raskt velge en uke springen uken nummer for å vise de ukene i ukeklaffen. Du kan også legge til nye hendelser fra kalendervisning ved å peke på tilsvarende datoer.\n  \nVærende uke og dagens dato er markert med oransje, slik at de er enkle å finne.\n  \nEkstrafunksjoner og tips\n\n• Fargen på en hendelse fra den valgte fargen på arrangementets opprinnelige kalenderen. Må prøve å ha flere kalendere med ulike farger for ulike klasser av hendelser - det gir suveren klarhet.\n• Navnet på arrangementet er forkortet, du kan rotere enheten til liggende modus, og dermed få mer seerområde.\n• Du kan også riste din iPhone for å gå tilbake til den aktuelle uken. Denne funksjonen fungerer ikke på iPad.\n• Den første gangen du bytte fra tab ukentlig til kategorien kalenderen etter at du åpner programmet igjen, blar kalenderen til dagens dato og inneværende uke."

TaskTask directly connects with your Office 365 Business, Exchange on-premises, or Google tasks to keep your full task list in sync between Outlook and your device. Everything is tracked, include all the advanced properties you can see in Outlook. Best of all TaskTask includes flagged items (email!) so you can see your complete task list on the go.\n\nUsing TaskTask, you can manage your to-do list, create tasks, set start/due dates, mark complete, assigning categories, change importance, set and receive reminders, and delete tasks. An Exchange Server or Office 365 account is required to synchronized tasks with Outlook. No additional software is necessary. TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

Doing the laundry is an epic feat of stamina so why not get stamina points for it?!\n\nThe to-do list is fully-featured and supports repeating tasks, displays reminders for overdue events and allows time-critical events to be assigned to specific days, while more aspirational quests can be set to \"someday\" so you don't lose sight of your goals. And each task completed is destroyed by your avatar, so get your Undead Warrior to beat-up your laundry, or your Treeman to headbutt your overspilling inbox.\n\nThe app is supplied with 5 animated avatars which grow in characteristics that represent your own life.

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

Thanks to everyone who reported this and helped us fix it!!\n\nNEW Version 1.1 allows you to:\n\n- NEW! Import Bulk Data from your computer into LockBox Pro.  Saves lots of typing on your device!\n\n- NEW! Export/Backup data to your computer over a WiFi connection! Remember to do this regularly!\n\n- NO Ads!\n\nUse it to keep information handy and also protected at the same time.\n\nNew Pro Edition Features:\n(not found in the free version)\n\n* Import Data - create a file on your computer and import it into LockBox Pro via Wifi.  Saves you lots of typing on the device.\n\n* Stronger Security - data is secured via Apple's Keychain which utilizes 3DES encryption for high security.\n\n* More Flexible - you can add as many fields as you like to each entry. (the free version is fixed at 2 fields per entry)\n\n* No Ads\n\nIMPORTANT:\nExisting free version users... you can now upgrade easily while keeping your data!  Just export your data first using the free version and then import it into LockBox Pro via the WiFi import feature.\n\nNew Features:\n\n* import/export via WiFi \n* Sound effects can now be turned off! :-)\n* The app exits correctly when you lock your iPhone with the top button.\n* You can now easily rearrange and delete items in your list. (and they stay rearranged)\n* Your data is backed up via the regular iTunes backup, but be sure to use the new export feature as data is sometimes saved incorrectly in iTunes. iTunes also does not allow you to change devices... your data will be lost if you don't back it up using the new WiFi export method.\n\n(all bug fixes are available in the free version as well... however the new advanced features are not)\n\nMore Info:\n\nAll data is encrypted and protected by your secret code, so only you have access to it, even if you let your friends borrow your phone to make a call or browse online.\n\nThis is the kind of information that you want easy access to while you are on the go, but find it hard to recall just when you need it.  For example, I always forget my bank account number right when I need to deposit a check at the bank.\n\nNot sure if you need this?\n\nTry the FREE version first... it's called LockBox (not Pro) :-)\n\nGo Pro for a low price for a limited time!  \n\nIMPORTANT BACKUP INFORMATION: \n\nRemember to sync and do a backup of your data through the LockBox app before updating to newer versions!  You never know what might happen to your phone in the middle of a sync :-)  Also, the iTunes backup is not enough in some cases especially when you have to replace your phone or reset it, so make sure you use the WiFi backup method to protect your data.  Its the only way to make sure your data is safe when doing a sync or restore for your device."

This app is great for using printers that can't be found with air print. It allows you to search for printers to add using wifi, or even manually enter a printer. 10 stars.\" - D, Dec 9, 2011\n\n\"FANTASTIC. This app did have an initial learning phase but everything is explained quite nicely in the help section. And once I understood the ropes, I can print almost everything I want ( haven't found anything yet which I haven't been able to print actually ). Highly recommended.\" - Ipad atheist turned devotee, Nov 23, 2011\n\n\"I can't stop using this app. Regards.\" - G, Sep 25, 2011\n\n\"WOW SWEET FOR NETWORK FILE PRINTING.

Email attachment printing is sweet!\" - T, Jul 22, 2011\n\n\nFEATURES\n    • View/print many document types, including PDF, Word, Excel, bitmap, TIFF, text, HTML, Open Office, GIF, and encapsulated PostScript.\n    • Create new text documents.\n    • Use a web browser to transfer files between your computer and this app.\n    • Print to networked or shared printers. No additional software is necessary. This app includes support for over 1,400 printers from HP, Epson, Canon, Samsung, Brother, Lexmark, Xerox, Ricoh, Oki, Kyocera, Infotec, NRG, Lanier, and many more!\n    • Print remote files on MobileMe, Box.net, or Dropbox, or download them into this app.\n    • Print web-based files or download them into this app.\n    • Capture and process images from your onboard camera or photo album.\n\n\nDOES THIS APP SUPPORT MY PRINTER?\nSee the list of printer models this app supports at http://www.ndilitechnologies.com/help.html.\n\n\nHOW DO I USE THIS APP TO PRINT FROM MY OTHER APPS?\nImport the files from your other iPhone/iPad apps into this app, and then use this app to print them.\niPad/iPhone's iOS is designed such that each app you install is given its own storage space. There is no centralized (shared) storage space on your device. This means that this app's proprietary printing engine only works within this app. To say it another way: the iOS does not support/allow third party system-wide drivers. The iOS cannot use this app to print files within another app's storage space—for example, files stored in Pages, Numbers, Safari, Notes, Mail, etc. Therefore, files created in other apps must be imported into this app.\n\n\nHOW DO I IMPORT FILES INTO THIS APP?\n    • Use a web browser to transfer files between your computer and this app.\n    • Use iTunes to upload files into this app.\n    • Use a WebDAV server to transfer files.\n    • Email a file to yourself. Then, open the Mail app, press and hold down the attachment until the \"Open In...\" menu appears. Select this app from the list of apps displayed.\n\n\nOptional Toll Free Number Subscription Notes (for fax/voicemail receipt): \n• Title: Toll-Free Number Subscription\n• Length: 1,3, 6 or 12 month options \n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at purchase confirmation\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase\n• Privacy policy: https://www.ndilitechnologies.com/privacy.html\n• Terms of use: https://www.ndilitechnologies.com/termsofuse.html"

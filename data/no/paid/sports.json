It's awesome!\n\nThis app will help you to organize your Americano tournament.\n\nYou just have to enter some basic information like the player names, how many courts you are playing on and how many points you are playing from. The app fixes the rest. \n\nAll matches are set up for all the rounds necessary for all players to play together with everyone.\n\nThe app now support 7 different kinds of Americanos. You can play;\nNormal Americano - All players plays one time with every player\nMixed Americano - Every round is played with one woman and a man in every team, you play until all women have played in the same team as all men.\nTeam Americano - You play as a team, you play until every team has played 1 time against every team\nMexicano - A fun form of play with the premise that the matches should be as even as possible. The first match is drawn for the participants. After that, the matches are based on the scoreboard.\nMixicano - Like Mexicano but you will always be drawn a woman and a man in each team!\nTeam Mexicano - Like Mexicano but with fixed teams!\nSuper Mexicano - Like Mexicano but you can get extra points the closer to the leader-court you are. \n\nYou can configure how many super-points you should get, and from what round it should happen.\n\n*********************\n\nRestrictions\n- Max 24 players\n- Max 16 players in the mix\n\nThe app works for odd (divided by 4) number of participants but the structure will not be so satisying if you are more than 9"

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

It records all types of sensor data provided by your iPhone/iPod/iPad (or external sensors), combines them, and makes them available to optimize your drive. Over time, you will get insights on your car and in your driving, not known before.\n\nLapTimer offers more than 1300 predefined tracks world wide. With its assistants, it is extremely easy to setup - just click your track and drive. It fully automates your lap timing using GPS, and presents the results to all kinds of media.\n\nYou are not limited to track driving only. For example, you may define your home and working locations as a 'track', collect statistics on different ways chosen, and analyze / optimize the time used every day. \n\nWant to show your drive to your friends? LapTimer Petrolhead and above generates beautiful in car video recordings with all kinds of data overlaid, ready to be presented - e.g. on youtube. Even without video, recorded data can be analyzed using purpose designed views, making it easy to analyze and improve your driving performance.\n\nUsing online racing, you can use LapTimer in competition. LapTimer offers a Hall of Fame, allows watching you and your friends on track - all in real time. Compare your sector times, braking / acceleration points, and learn from each other. \n\nYou can start with your plain iPhone in the beginning and add external GPS and OBD II sensors later, step by step, and as you need it. LapTimer itself comes in three different editions: LapTimer Rookie is the entry level with all you need for lap timing; LapTimer Petrolhead is the advanced version including lots of video features, and LapTimer Grand Prix is the edition for professionals including Multi Cam recording, Health Kit integration, and advanced sensor and analytics functionality. \n\nPlease note that functionality depends on your device, the LapTimer edition chosen, and sometimes even external sensors added (like OBD II). Please visit our web page to get the full story. All edition can be upgraded later, all editions come with native iPhone and iPad support. \n\nThere are quite expensive stand alone solutions for track days available. Be smart and own the leading edge tool simply by using your iPhone and LapTimer. Besides the professional area, there is no known solution that offers more functionality than LapTimer does - across the market. As our ambition is to offer the best tool, LapTimer is enhanced continuously.\n\nPlease visit http://www.gps-laptimer.de for detailed information on versions, FAQs / documentation, in depth technology background information, online racing, and supported device configurations.

      "label": "Shooter is an external ballistics calculator designed to bring you  highly accurate solutions quickly. Shooter accomplishes this by saving your firearm and ammo data and makes it easily selectable upon loading the app as well as providing features like Kestrel and WeatherFlow integration to import your atmospherics via Bluetooth. Shooter has successfully aided hunters, marksmen and sniper teams for years.\n\nSome key features:\n\n* An extremely accurate, fast and proven ballistics solver created by Berger Bullet's chief ballistician and champion shooter Bryan Litz\n\n* Save firearm and ammo data as profiles so you don't have to continually entering the same constant data over and over each time you want a calculation\n\n* You probably have several firearms and loads.  It's tedious entering all this data on a handheld device.  With Shooter, you can login to a web interface using your PC at http://manage.shooterapp.net and enter/manage all your firearm/ammo data then simply sync it to your device.\n\n* Finger-controlled graphical wind dial for easy wind angle input\n\n* Online profile backup included at no extra charge\n\n* Built-in large bullet library to make it simpler to add your ammo profiles.  Shooter now supports syncing bullet data from the cloud in order to provide quicker updates for newly released bullets\n\n* Supports Coriolis Effect and Spin Drift calculations; Can get your Latitude and Azimuth for Coriolis Effect using GPS and compass.\n\n* Automatic-atmosphere input using your GPS location and nearest weather station\n\n* Zero-atmosphere support.  This will auto-account for changes to your zero when shooting in a different atmosphere\n\n* Solution screen which allows for extremely quick and easy changing of shot distance, wind or lead speed\n\n* Load atmospherics from Kestrel 5000-series, Kestrel DROP 1/2/3 or WeatherFlow WeatherMeter\n\n* Graph bullet path, drift and velocity with ability to compare up to 6 loads at once\n\n* Velocity Calibration tool which helps you determine your muzzle velocity.\n\n* Email trajectory table output\n\n* Full metric support\n\n\nFor more information and operation manual, please visit http://www.shooterapp.net/manual.php"

LapTimer itself comes in three different editions: LapTimer Rookie is the entry level with all you need for lap timing; LapTimer Petrolhead is the advanced version including lots of video features, and LapTimer Grand Prix is the edition for professionals including Multi Cam recording, Health Kit integration, and advanced sensor and analytics functionality. \n\nPlease note that functionality depends on your device, the LapTimer edition chosen, and sometimes even external sensors added (like OBD II). Please visit our web page to get the full story. All edition can be upgraded later, all editions come with native iPhone and iPad support. \n\nThere are quite expensive stand alone solutions for track days available. Be smart and own the leading edge tool simply by using your iPhone and LapTimer. Besides the professional area, there is no known solution that offers more functionality than LapTimer does - across the market. As our ambition is to offer the best tool, LapTimer is enhanced continuously.\n\nPlease visit http://www.gps-laptimer.de for detailed information on versions, FAQs / documentation, in depth technology background information, online racing, and supported device configurations. Join our user community on http://www.gps-laptimer-forum.de to be involved in future development - all with first class support."

Programmen som är unika och tas fram slumpmässigt för varje gång kan modifieras genom att moment kan uteslutas. Det finns möjlighet att lägga till en slumpmässig belöningssignal och välja antalet belöningar. Man kan kasta sig ut i osäkerheten och lyssna på ett slumpat program, alternativt läsa programmet först innan man lyssnar eller sätta det i händerna på en kompis som inte är insatt i lydnadsreglerna och bli kommenderad av honom/henne.\n\nDet är möjligt att välja antal sekunder till start, programmets längd, tiden mellan kommandona, antalet upprepningar av ett helt program och hur lång tid man vill ha till vila och lek mellan upprepningarna. Det är bara startklassen som har ett tävlingsprogram för det fria följet eftersom det är så väl beskrivet i reglerna. Det finns en manlig och en kvinnlig tävlingsledare att välja mellan.\n\nKommandona läses upp samtidigt som de skrivs ut på skärmen. För att hålla reda på vilken gångart man är i mellan halterna används färg-hjälp. \n\nLäs mer på appens egen hemsida: https://fot.lottabergman.com"

      "label": "Keep track of your players' time on the field with Coach's Clock.\n\nDesigned with input from a youth soccer coach who manages multiple teams each season, Coach's Clock is a very simple application that runs on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. It keeps track of all of the players on your team, where they are supposed to be on the field, and how long they've been playing since they were last substituted into the game.\n\nJust enter in your team name and your player roster. Drag your players on and off the field and tap the clock to start it running. Players on the field accrue elapsed time. Players off the field do not. It's that simple.\n\nWhat Coach's Clock does:\n\n* It tracks how much time has elapsed in the current play period.\n* It tracks the position of every player on your team.\n* It keeps track of how long each player has been on the field.\n* It helps you plan player substitutions.\n* It has field backgrounds for basketball, field hockey, football, hockey and soccer but it could also be used for any similar sport.\n* It supports an unlimited number of teams.\n* It has detailed usage instructions right inside the app.\n* It's a \"universal app\" so one purchase is good for all your iDevices!\n\nWhat it doesn't do:\n\n* Coach's Clock doesn't force you to keep the app running throughout your game. You are free to close it, open other apps, take phone calls, or whatever you like. You only need to run it when you want to refer to it or when you need to make a change. The clocks keep time even when the app isn't running.\n* Coach's Clock is not a replacement for your whiteboard or playbook. (There are plenty of other fine apps which can do that for you.)\n\nCoach's Clock may seem like a pretty simple app, and it is! But that's the beauty of it. It doesn't try to do everything for you; instead it tries to do a few essential things very well. It doesn't try to change the way you coach your team; it just makes your job a little easier."

The app also calculates your Stableford points fully-automatically. This is facilitated by a vast database containing the score card information and the ratings of the golf courses (unlike other apps with which the users have to create the score cards themselves). \nThe database is updated and extended daily. An overview of the current list of courses can be found at courses.expertgolf.com. \n\nWhy Expert Golf is better\n▸ User-friendly and intuitive operation (a manual is superfluous).\n▸ The first score card in the world that can be signed on the touchscreen.\n▸ More precise data thanks to professional mapping.\n▸ Database updated daily.\n▸ Support 365 days a year.\n▸ No advertising pop-ups at all.\n▸ Excellent customer ratings and top rankings in the App Store.\n▸ Leading app for many years and improved with regular updates.\n\nIncluding updates for one year. (Note: Expert Golf is NOT a subscription. The annual fee will not automatically be charged again after the year has ended. You can continue to use the app without renewing the service, you will just no longer be able to download any new courses from the database.)\n\nFAQ – Why Expert Golf charges an annual fee\nEach year approximately 15% of golf courses are redesigned or newly built or the order of their holes is changed etc. This means that the database has to be constantly maintained and updated. Only with an annual fee concept will you be guaranteed access to up-to-date and comprehensive data that you can trust on a long-term basis. Providers that only charge a once-only payment for their app will sooner or later stop maintaining their data.\n\nExpert Golf is the only app that puts everything a player needs on a round of golf onto the iPhone. It comprises a total of four modules including “iGolfrules” – one of the world’s most popular sport apps that has been in the App Store top ten continually for many years and is officially recommended by Apple.

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

The app paid for itself straight away.\" \n\"Great app, worth every penny saved money on a service already !!!!\" \n\"This is a good App for the keen cyclist, as a Cytech technician I recommend this App.\" \n\"Excellent application with some nice clear photos.

SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year.

The Guide is built up in an eclectic way, inspired by different teachers and schools. Access to different levels of information will provide challenges and inspiration to beginners as well as teachers. The Aikido Guide contains: \n• Techniques applied from 12 different attacks\n• 19 in-depth explanations of core techniques\n• 4 modes: Basic, advanced and two flowing modes \n• 344 videos of different combinations of attack, technique and mode \n• 568 different applications including Omote and Ura.

Among these were the explanations of the four modes, as well as the in-depth explanation of Kotegaeshi and several of the flowing techniques from Yokomen uchi and Shomen uchi. In this way the Aikido Guide is improved without the need of making new versions of the application itself.\n\nBJORN EIRIK OLSEN received his 6th Dan in 2004 and was promoted to Shihan by Aikikai Hombu Dojo in January 2012.

Some examples:   \n\n\"Eine tolle App, führ mich momentan die beste Aikido-App. Sehr striukturiert und vor allem sehr viele Angriffs-Technik-Kombinationen. Zumindest führ einen Anfänger wie mich extrem hilfreich, da die Techniken detailliert gezeight und auch erklärt werden.\"\nBy x10001 from Switzerland about Aikido Guide (version 1.5, Apple App Store) on Nov 21, 2013.\n\n\"It's perfect for a beginner like me and i believe it will be very useful to the seasoned practitioners.

Arigato gozaimashita.\"\nBy Chris in Virginia from United States about AikidoGuide (version 1.2, Apple App Store) on Jun 15, 2012.\n\n\"This is the first useful aikido guide I've seen.

      "label": "Avy savvy backcountry skiers and riders know that three things count when it comes to the terrain’s influence on avalanches: the slope, the elevation, and the (compass) aspect. And the Avalanche Inclinometer delivers all three. Sure, you can find plenty of inclinometer apps (also known as clinometers) that are designed for carpenters, but Steve's Avalanche Inclinometer is meant for people who spend time in avalanche terrain. \n\nThis app shows the slope, elevation, and aspect in BIG FONTS which are perfect for tired eyes in stormy (or bright-and-too-sunny) weather. And it doesn’t display a gaggle of tiny buttons and widgets to decipher when you should be skiing.\n\nYou can sight across a slope by holding your phone parallel to the slope, or you can sight up or down a slope by sighting along the long-edge of your phone like a gunsight. (Through-the-camera sighting is nifty when the light is just right, but it often isn't.)\n\nWhen you have your phone aligned with the slope, a single tap on the screen will lock the data so you can read it. The Avalanche Inclinometer will even speak to you as you’re measuring the steepness so you won’t need to look at the screen. And the BIG inclinometer dial changes colors based on the slope which provides instant feedback on how the steepness of the terrain is contributing to the likelihood of an avalanche.\n\nAfter measuring the slope, you can tap a single button to share your current GPS location, the slope in degrees, and the elevation. The email includes kml and gpx waypoint files, and a link that will let you quickly see the location in any browser. You can enter the email address one time and the Avalanche Inclinometer will remember it for next time. Less typing; more skiing.\n\nThe Avalanche Inclinometer isn’t free, but apps don’t grow on trees. To buy this app you’ll spend less than buying a beer at a ski resort—think of it as buying Steve a beer!\n\nIn addition to the Avalanche Inclinometer, it is important that you take an avy class, pay attention to the avalanche red flags, use good route finding techniques, and practice your avalanche rescue skills frequently"

      "label": "The 'YO YO Endurance Test' provides an important instrument for determining the level of physical efficiency of an athlete.\nThe physical capacity is evaluated quickly and easily by placing two cones spaced 20 meters each other.\nThe athlete has to run at full speed from one cone to another and then return again on the first cone. This path must be repeated for six times without any break, and get  the split times every time the athlete passes on the first cone.\n\nThis application will track all the split time and at the end will be calculated two parameters that determine the outcome of the test. More these values are low and better will be the athlete's performance.\n\nBasically the final result is given by a mathematical formula that processes the delta between the averages of the last two split times and the first two split times  and thereby the athlete's ability to maintain its maximum speed for a certain period of time.\n\nThe second value obtained on completion of the test, is the first result considering also the total time of the test.\n\nThe 'YO YO Endurance Test' can be used to determine the level of athletic in all sports (football, running, basketball, volleyball, cycling, tennis etc.)\nAt the end of the test you can get for each athlete the final result (eg. \"Above average\" or \"Poor\") and the Vo2Max estimate\n\nYou can manage more Athletes and save personal data and notes.\nYou can analyze test results.\nAutomatic Sync between devices thanks to iCloud\nInfo section where you can better understand how prepare the test and you can visit linked website and video where get more info about YO-YO Endurance Test\n\nIf you find this application useful, please give a positive review in the AppStore, so we can further improve and develop new options.\n\nFor any further information, please send an email to:\nsupport@bitandweb.com\n\nThanks"

Manage and organize multiple teams fairly and efficiently, with less stress and more time to enjoy the truly rewarding experience that being a Soccer Dad brings. Click “...More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\nBest soccer app - *****\nby Ciaran O'Shaughnessy - Dec 11, 2010\n\n\"I have downloaded and tried maybe 15 or more apps to help manage games, players (rotations, time played etc) and track stats for players on my Recreational and Club team.\nWhile there are probably 3 that are worthwhile. One is good and has 90% of what I needed, but is not user friendly and difficult to use. The second is great and easy to use, but only has 80% of what I needed. This app has 99% of what anyone needs, is easy to use and is user friendly. In addition the developer is quick to respond and eager to find out what else would improve the product.\nI would have given this 10 stars as a rating, but unfortunately 5 is the most one can give.\"\n\nThe whistle blows and your team springs into action. As you watch them play, you can’t help but feel proud of those kids. They’ve come so far since the beginning of this year’s soccer season. Thankfully, as their coach, you have, too.\n\nWhen you first started coaching kids’ soccer, you manually made up schedules, juggled rotations, organized events and volunteers. You did it all, including reports and communicating with parents. It was a lot of work but seeing the kids improve and grow was satisfying and worth all that effort. Sadly, it didn’t give you much time to enjoy your role as much as you were hoping.\n\nThanks to the Soccer Dad app, you can now take care of all your team’s administration needs in a much easier way. You’ll be so organized and efficient, that you’ll enjoy coaching even more. Communicating with parents and players is a breeze too, because the app holds the full contact information of everyone you may need to get in touch with.\n\nEver need to schedule or reschedule games and practices? Of course you do. No problem, Soccer Dad can help you with that and will even mark the dates on your built-in iPhone calendar. You also have the option of having Soccer Dad issue reminders about those dates. \n\nJust look at how Soccer Dad can help you and your team:\n* Fairly and efficiently manage and organize multiple teams by season\n* Easy access of player contact information – quickly communicate with parents\n* Organize events and have them display in your iPhone calendar\n* Keep track of volunteers\n* Replace your stopwatch and clipboard – lets you know when it’s time to change players, even if it’s in your pocket.\n* Send emails without ever leaving the app\n* Use the camera and photo library for player pictures\n* Optimized for the iPhone and iPad retina display\n\nIf you’re one of those special people who coaches kids’ soccer, let this helper app make the season and administrative tasks a little more comfortable and less labor intensive. Then you’ll have time for what’s truly important – the kids.\n\nDownload Soccer Dad now.\n\nSee this App in action here:  http://www.youtube.com/soccerdadapp\n\n- Support -\n\nIf you have questions/issues/feedback regarding the app, please contact me through my support link below.\n\n(Unfortunately, I can't respond to App Store reviews because there's no way to contact reviewers.)"

But there are products out there, where you can put your iDevice into, to make it waterproof and still be able to operate it. In this way you can either mount it near your other instruments on your keelboat or strap it to your arm if you are sailing a dinghy.\n\nFeatures:\n\nMain View.\nHere you can see your 4 most important readouts, fore instance Heading, Speed, VMG and Performance.\n\nThere also is a lift indicator, showing you if you have been lifted by a wind shift, and graphs showing the development in your speed and VMG over a configurable amount of time and a permormance bar.\n\nWind direction.\nSet your wind direction by storing your heading while sailing on upwind on starboard and port tack, or simply type it in.\n\nStart view.\nHere you have your count down (including sync), and you can mark your starting line and iRegatta will calculate the distance to the line and indicate the favorite line end, if wind direction is set.\n\nStatistics view.\nView your current position and trip odometer and max speed since last reset. You'll also see a polar diagram with your speed and VMG (wind speed dependent).\n\nWaypoints.\nNavigate to your favorite pre-stored waypoints, or create a new temporary waypoint by cross bearing using the iPhone internal camera, or by distance/bearing.\n\nTracking.\nRecord your track and view it on the map or export it for further analysis to your computer.\n\nInstead of internal GPS you can get instrument information over WiFi from NMEA0183 instruments. \n\nAIS data received over WiFi will be displayed in a Radar-like view.\n\niRegatta also comes with a watch app, which will allow you to view data on your watch as well as operate the start line features. Besides that, the watch app will track your sailing as an activity and help you close your activity circles using HealthKit..\n\nRead more detailed information on the apps web page."

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle type and clip position, pilot jet and air screw position are shown (screw position is expressed in turns from fully tightened). These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration introduced in the next tabs. Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. The air density and density altitude are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine (you know that each engine has its own personality). \n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the model year, model and carburetor, and the oil mix ratio that you\\'re using.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures.\n\nValid for the following models from 2005 to 2021:\n- 50 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 50 SX Factory Edition: 2021.\n- 50 SX Mini: 2017-2021.\n- 65 SX: 2017-2021.\n- 85 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 105 SX: 2006-2012.\n- 125 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 125 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 125 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 125 XC: 2017-2018.\n- 144 SX: 2007-2008.\n- 150 SX: 2009-2021.\n- 150 XC: 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019.\n- 200 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 200 XC: 2005-2012.\n- 250 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 250 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 250 XC: 2007-2019.\n- 250 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 XC: 2009-2018.\n- 300 MXC: 2005.\n* Please note that the application is valid only for engines that use carburetor.

      "label": "▸ GOLF & COUNTRY wrote: “Highly-accurate data. Clever.”\n▸ EXTRA GOLF wrote: “The undisputed no. 1 golf app.”\n▸ GOLF JOURNAL wrote: “A real must for golfers who own an iPhone.”\n▸ GOLFERS ONLY wrote: “The perfect virtual caddie. Recommendation: Buy.”\n\nOn the basis of state-of-the-art GPS technology, the GPS Caddie from Expert Golf sends the exact distance to the green directly to your display – with an accuracy of 1-3 meters. You can also measure the length of your shots (e.g. drives). The distances are permanently available to be read off the display, without any user interaction (no aiming necessary and you do not have to be able to see the flag). This is facilitated by a vast database containing the GPS coordinates of the golf courses.\nThe accuracy of the data is of utmost importance to Expert Golf. Therefore highly-accurate data is collected in cooperation with the national surveying and topography offices and other government agencies – as opposed to most other providers whose apps are based on free aerial imagery and who thus tolerate discrepancies of tens of meters. \nThe database is updated and extended daily. An overview of the courses already mapped is available at courses.expertgolf.com. \n\nWhy Expert Golf is better\n▸ User-friendly and intuitive operation (a manual is superfluous).\n▸ More precise distance information thanks to mapping by professional surveyors.\n▸ Virtually no roaming charges (no need to download aerial photos).\n▸ No network coverage required (the app only uses the free GPS signal).\n▸ No advertising pop-ups.\n▸ Database updated daily.\n▸ Support 365 days a year.\n▸ Excellent customer ratings and top rankings in the App Store.\n▸ Leading app for many years and improved with regular updates.\n\n100% RULES COMPLIANT! The use of iPhones as distance measuring devices has been permitted in tournaments since 1.1.2014, on the condition that distance measuring devices are allowed in the Local Rules. (Please note: Many GPS apps give advice on club selection and are therefore banned. However “Expert Golf” complies with the rules as per the R&A.)\n\nIncluding updates for one year. (Note: Expert Golf is NOT a subscription. The annual fee will not automatically be charged again after the year has ended. You can continue to use the app without renewing the service, you will just no longer be able to download any new courses from the database.)\n\nFAQ – Why Expert Golf charges an annual fee\nEach year approximately 15% of golf courses are redesigned or newly built or the order of their holes is changed etc. This means that the database has to be constantly maintained and updated. Only with an annual fee concept will you be guaranteed access to up-to-date and comprehensive data that you can trust on a long-term basis. Providers that only charge a once-only payment for their app will sooner or later stop maintaining their data.\n\nExpert Golf is the only app that puts everything a player needs during a round of golf onto the iPhone. It comprises a total of four modules including “iGolfrules” – one of the world’s most popular sport apps that has been in the App Store top ten continually for many years and is officially recommended by Apple. You can add the following additional modules to your app (charges apply)\n▸ Score card & Stableford calculator\n▸ Golf rules\n▸ Golf tips\n\nIf you are happy with our app we would be grateful if you would take a moment of your time to post a rating/ write a review in the App Store.\nIf, for whatever reason, you are not happy with the app or have any questions about it please contact our support team at support@expertgolf.com."

      "label": "This nice little tool - a must have for every paraglider pilot - emulates a variometer on your iPhone. \n\nSince version 3.0 the app supports iOS9, as well as the pressure sensor of your iPhone 6(s) or iPhone  6(s) Plus. \n\nTherefore your iPhone is a complete replacement for a \"real\" variometer. \n\nIn conjunction with an external sensor such as ASI FlyNet2, FlyTec SenseBox or the XC-TRacer, the app provides even more precise climb- and sink-rates. \n\nYou can use it to measure\n\n    - climb/decline rate\n    - absolute altitude\n    - hight over ground\n    - relative height\n    - speed over ground and\n    - course\n\nValues ​​displayed in meters or feet/kn.\n\nThe current climb- or sink-rate is signaled via different \"beep\" sounds, as usual for a variometer. \n\nYou can watch your flight using the integrated map view in real time, so you will never loose your orientation. Even if your are flying accidentally within a cloud or under poor visibility conditions!\n\nBy typing to „Alt 3“ - usually after the adjusting phase - or any time later you can reset „Alt 3“ to „0“.\n\nMoreover you can use the App to\n\n    - record you flights \n    - view your recorded flights in the integrated map view  \n    - send your recorded flights by mail as kml-files or gpx -files to your friends \n    \nOne last note: \nThe app reacts a little somewhat slower, as e.g. a Bräuninger- or Flytec Vario, if you use the internal pressure sensor of the iPhone, because the sensor doesn't provide data as often as an external sensor. \n\nThe app requires a good GPS signal, if no internal or external pressure sensor can be used. \n\nPlease make sure in any case, that you have a good GPS signal,  if you use the app. \nThe app does NOT work - completely and reliably - in buildings or other situations in which you have no or a bad GPS signal! \nHowever, this should not be a problem, since you usually flying under a clear open sky. ;-) \n\nUsage - without - an internal or external sensor is possible, but subject to known the limitations of a pure GPS operation, such as using only open-air, a good GPS signal and altitude changes > 5m with at least 1-2 m/s. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\nEven if the App is running in background, the GPS location service is used by the App, if you record your flight!"

This encourages the players to continue shooting in an effort\n to reach 10 000 shots. The shot counting screen can be used to keep track of slapshots, wrist shots, back hands, and snap shots. \n\n• Video Teaching Tips - The app comes with 4 shooting tips for each type of shot. The main video will teach proper technique, while the following three videos for \neach shot type will give tips on advanced shooting methods. The advanced shooting tips will help keep shooting practice fun, and also teach the player new ways to use each shot\n\n• Training - The app comes with two training tools, the buzzer beater and the quick release. \n\n•• The buzzer beater is a count down clock with a built in delay to allow players to prepare for the first shot after hitting the start button. The countdown clock\nduration can be set by the player. The player can use the buzzer beater clock to see how many shots they can take in a set amount of time, how many times they can hit the net\nfrom different distances in a given time, how many targets they can hit in a given time, etc. Use the buzzer beater for all types of shots, and keep track of how many shots\nyou are taking with the shot counter\n\n•• The quick release tool will train the player to shoot the puck quickly and accurately. The player inputs how many pucks they want to shoot, and the break duration\nbetween each shot. The app will then call out a location to hit, the player must shoot for the loction that was called out, and then set up to shoot for their next shot. \nThis training tool teaches quick release, and reaction time as the player needs to quickly adjust their shot depending on what location is called out. \n\n• Tracking - The app comes with a built in notepad that allows players to keep track of their achievements such as accuracy and shot velocity (if they have a radar\ngun). With the touch of a button the player can also instantly share how many shots they have taken with the Facebook and Twitter buttons."

You can use these tools at your air station to provide the information you need to fill a Nitrox tank from any existing mix (or empty). Dive Planning tools provide your Equivalent Air Depth, PPO2 at your planned depth, Maximum & Contingency Operating Depth at various oxygen partial pressures and  the \"best mix\" for a planned depth and oxygen partial pressure.\n\nYou can easily switch between Metric and Imperial/U.S. systems of measurement to adapt to a new fill station. The dive planning tools also support both salt and fresh water calculations.\n\nChances are you regularly work with a specific set of mixes and and common dive situations. Nitrox Tools includes the convenience of saved settings that you can recall at a touch and adjust to a new situation as needed. You can also select mix values using pre-installed default mixes or your own saved custom mixes. When updating one of the mixes for a tool you are offered a list of saved mixes that you can use directly or adjust as needed. You can save the currently displayed mix by clicking the \"+\" button. Just like with the saved calculations, you can re-arrange or delete any mixes in your saved list.\n\nDo you need to share your planning or blending calculations with other divers? All the tools have the ability to share the results of the calculations from within the application. You can set default email addresses and a subject within Nitrox Tool's settings that will be automatically added when you share a result.\n\nNitrox Tools supports a number of blending methods:\n\n• Top Up - blend a final mix from starting mix and pressure using 100% oxygen and air or any available topping mix.\n\n• Bleed Down - save expensive oxygen and valuable time by easily calculating how much gas to bleed from an existing cylinder to switch to a different mix using air or any available topping mix.\n\n• Mix + Mix - make a specific final mix using the remaining gas in the cylinder and mixing that with banked Nitrox (rather than pure oxygen) and air or another topping mix. This enables the blending of Nitrox without the use of pure oxygen for certain combinations of mixes. Avoiding pure oxygen may increase the safety of the blending process and help manage the cost.\n\n• Top Off - determine the expected result from topping an existing cylinder with air or some other topping mix. This situation is common when a diver wants to have the blender top the mix remaining from the first dive with air from the boat's compressor.\n\nRemember you must always personally analyze your mix before diving it.\n\nThis application is not a substitute for proper training and should not be used as a substitute for proper dive planning or the primary Nitrox blending and planning methods taught during training. Please do not attempt to handle high pressure oxygen or fill SCUBA cylinders without proper training."

      "label": "Listen to your racquet and perfect your game!\n\nRacquetTune ensures that your racquet is ideally suited to your style of play. Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

A great hands-free way to use SkyDroid.\n\n• Book discounted tee times directly through SkyDroid.\n\nNo other fees are involved, and you can download as many courses you want without any other charges. \n\nWith SkyDroid – Golf GPS, our simple-to-use design will have you spending your time on your golf game, not on clicking buttons. \n\nView all our courses at www.skydroid.net/courses.php\n\nView our FAQ at www.skydroid.net/faq.php\n\n\nUSAGE NOTES:\n\n• SEARCHING for Courses: When searching for courses by name, you can just search for \"Aug\" instead of \"Augusta National Golf Course\" (leave out the quote marks).\n\n• SEARCHING for Courses: Radar button will find Mapped courses within 25mi/40km of your current location.\n\n• To save battery power, click your power button to turn off the screen when not in use.\n\n• Set your GPS Keep Alive in the SkyDroid settings to control how long GPS stays active when SkyDroid is in the background. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n• GPS accuracy can vary over time (click the GPS signal strength icon at any time to see your accuracy).\n\n• Before playing a course preview its mapping by clicking the link for the course name at www.skydroid.net/courses.php (best done using a large screen). Let us know of any mapping issues, or make changes yourself.\n\n• If we don’t have your course, you can add it as long as there is a satellite image of the course available in Course Mapper.\n\n• Change distance measurement (yards/meters) in the app Settings available on the in-app Menu.\n\n• While playing golf you will only incur data usage while using the Satellite View screen. Course downloads can be done at home over Wi-Fi and are small in size.\n\nEnjoy your round!!"

It is easy and fun to use, whilst being a powerful productivity tool for anyone involved in coaching youth soccer at any age or level.\n\nRecord key game events in real-time. These include goals, assists, shots (on and off target), saves, crosses, corner kicks, substitutions, fouls, offsides, penalty goals and misses, yellow and red cards, own goals. Playing position and formation changes can also be recorded.\n\nTrack playing time for each player and statistics for all events during a game. Overall and individual player statistics, including playing time, can be viewed and filtered by team, competition, season and opponent. Team records can be viewed for all games and similarly filtered.\n\nDirectly manipulate team line-ups and formations for maximum flexibility and ease of use. For example, during an 11-a-side game, 4-4-2 can quickly be changed to 4-3-3 simply by dragging a player from midfield to attack or alternatively to 4-5-1 by dragging a player from attack to midfield. Substitutions can be made by dragging players to and from the bench.\n\nDefine multiple competitions, each with their own game format, including the number of players and substitutes, the number of periods and their duration and whether they can go to overtime and/or a penalty shootout if the score is level. This can be overridden for individual games.\n\nRecord contact information for all players and coaches for easier communication with parents and opposing team coaches.  Link games to calendar events and their location to maps.\n\nShare information by email, SMS, Facebook and Twitter and automatically tweet game events.\n\nDefine jersey colors and styles and team logos for all teams making team identification easy.

Calculations are provided for the best Trimix given a planned depth and a desired maximum partial pressure of oxygen and equivalent narcotic depth (END). You can also calculate the ceiling and maximum depths along with your END based on your planned mix. The dive planning tools support both salt water and fresh water calculations. The blending tools provide for filling a cylinder with a remaining mix (or empty) to a specified target mix using oxygen, helium and a topping mix (air or another available mix). You can also calculate the result of topping an existing partially filled cylinder with a specific topping mix (air or another available mix). There is also a Bleed Down calculator that allows you adjust an existing full or partially full cylinder to a new mix with minimal wasted gas. Trimix Tools supports calculations in both metric and Imperial/US systems of measure.\n\nTraveling on a boat or working out of network range? These tools are at hand any time you have your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. You could, for example, easily calculate the result of topping your cylinder from your first dive with air from the boat's compressor to take advantage of any remaining mix. You also have the convenience of saved settings that you can recall at a touch and adjust to a new situation as needed.\n\nChances are you regularly work with a specific set of mixes and common dive situations. Trimix Tools includes the convenience of saved settings that you can recall and adjust to a new situation as needed. You can also select mix values using pre-installed default mixes or your own saved custom mixes. When updating one of the mixes for a tool you are offered a list of saved mixes that you can use directly or adjust as needed. You can save the currently displayed mix by tapping on the \"+\" button. Just like with the saved calculations, you can re-arrange or delete any mixes in your saved list.\n\nDo you need to share your planning or blending calculations with other divers? All the tools have the ability to share the results of the calculations from within the application. You can set default email addresses and a subject Trimix Tool's settings that will be automatically added when you share a result.\n\nAll END calculations (Dive Planning and Best Trimix tabs) in Trimix Tools treat oxygen as a narcotic gas by default. There is an option available under the Settings tab to change the default so that oxygen is not treated as narcotic if that is your preference. Remember you must always personally analyze your mix before diving it.\n\nThis application is not a substitute for proper training and should not be used as a substitute for proper dive planning or the primary Trimix blending and planning methods taught during training. Please do not attempt to handle high pressure oxygen or fill SCUBA cylinders without proper training."

      "label": "Who's On-Soccer helps youth-soccer coaches manage who's on the field and who's going on next.\n\nIt has been developed for the iPhone and iPad with experienced coaches who find managing rotations and balancing play time awkward and stressful.\n\nWatch our feature videos at \"http://whos-on.leftcoastlabs.biz/videos/soccer\".\n\n\nWhat coaches have said about Who's On apps...\n    \n\"It's intuitive and easy of use.\"\n\n\"It can handle all the unpredictability of coaching youth sports. For instance, I don't know who's going to be there [on game day] until I show up at the game. Players sometimes show up late or leave early. Young players decide at the last minute that they don't want to go on, messing up my planned rotation. This app allows me to handle all this... with ease.\"\n \n\"I like how clearly each player's name, number and picture is presented on the screen. I have a lousy memory and remembering new player names at the start of a season is always a problem for me.\"\n\n\"The 1-touch Position History is really well done... I wouldn't want to coach again without it!\"\n\n\"I love how easy it is to add player photos to the team.\"\n\n\nFeature Summary:\n\nSimple drag and drop - With Who's On-Soccer, you simply drag player icons from the \"bench\" to \"field positions\" as you make decisions for your starting lineup or substitutions. The app remembers \"who\" you've assigned \"where\" and tracks how long each player has been in each position during the game.\n\n1-screen game information - All game-time information is displayed clearly on one screen (as shown in the screen shots). Bright yellow banners clearly indicate where you've pre-assigned substitutes for your next rotation.\n\n1-button rotation - When it's time to make substitutions, you press one button to indicate that the subs have taken the field and the app records this event. The app then places the icons of the players coming off the field back on the bench ready for their next rotation assignments.\n\nBuilt-in substitution timer - A built-in timer can be used to balance rotation times.\n\nPress-and-hold play history (a unique and celebrated feature of Who's On-Soccer) – By simply dragging a player's icon to the bottom of the screen, the display will change to show a Position History (graphically indicating where the player has played and for how long).\n\nHot-Cold Indicators - shows which players have significantly more or less play time than the average.  Players with significantly more play time are highlighted red (Hot).  Similarly, blue (Cold) for less play time.\n\nSimple score tracking – Tap the scoreboard and quickly add goals and record who scored and who assisted.  All scoring information is automatically stored with the game for post-game review.\n\nFast team setup - We've built Who's On-Soccer to allow you to enter a team's information quickly. Typically it only takes a few minutes to enter all your team's information.\n\n1-touch player pictures - Capture player pictures with the app's integrated camera function. 1-touch, point and click.\n\nMultiple teams - If you coach or assist with two or more teams, this app supports multiple teams. Simply select the team you want to use from the team list and your ready to go.\n\nFlexible field formations - Who's On-Soccer supports any field formation. Changing field positions is just another drag and drop activity. You simply \"unlock\" the field, move, add or remove positions and then \"lock\" the field. The app will remember the last formation you used for each team you coach.\n\nGame / Practice schedules - Who's On-Soccer let's you store your team's schedule in your phone if you desire. \n\nGame data and notes - Use game notes to track pre-game thoughts and reminders as well as post-game comments.  All game data is stored in the team's schedule as a completed game. Game stats can be reviewed at any time or sent to the team's record keeper via email. \n\n\nSupported platforms:\n - built for iPhone or iPod Touch\n - runs on iPad as iPhone app"

Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

Short videos show how to execute the individual steps correctly from several different perspectives - in real time, slow motion and with diagrams. In order to study individual movement sequences in greater detail, it is possible to move the pictures both forwards and backwards individually. \nStill pictures with explanatory texts illustrate the crucial phases of the movement and help users improve their technique so as to ski more efficiently.\nOnce the app has been downloaded, the videos can be played without an Internet connection. Thanks to its functional design, the app can be used directly on the ski trail."

      "label": "Mobile App \"RallyPacenotes\" (www.rallypacenotesapp.com) is designed to be the best aid for rally drivers (section \"Driver\") and rally codrivers (\"Co-driver\" section).\n\nThe application was created by Miguel E. Susunaga Valencia (migSVapps.com), from the original idea of Raúl Belategui and with the sports advice of David Nafría. Its effectiveness and usefulness have been contrasted in the pacenotes courses TheRallyDriver.com for drivers.\n\n\n\"Driver\" section:\n\nThe \"Driver\" section is designed to help rally drivers in the difficult task of doing special stages pacenotes. The app allows teams to write down the intensity of each corner using the steering wheel angle rotation. The numbering of each corner, \"8\", \"3+\", \"120\" or any other information that each pilot uses in its pacenotes system, is fully configurable, as well as the strip of degrees in which it must show the Information.\n\nThe application is designed to be used in the first “recce” run, which is performed at low speed, for this reason and because a high speed can affect the sensor measurement, the corner numbering is shown only when the speed is less than 80 km/h.\n\nIn addition to intensity, the application also helps us calculate the distances between corners using GPS signal. The driver has up to 3 different trips. One “partial”, another “total” and even a third specially designed to measure the corner’s lengths.\n\nIt also shows us the current speed of the vehicle. Something that is especially useful in those recces in which the speed is limited and controlled by the organization. The driver can set at what speed he wants to receive an alert so as not to exceed that limit. Two different speeds can be set with their respective alerts.\n\n\n\"Codriver\" section:\n\nThe \"Codriver\" section is divided into 3 screens. The first offers codrivers the tools necessary to facilitate the management of times and distances between time controls. It allows to calculate the time of entry in the following time control, it shows the real time, the time remaining until the next time control and 3 trips (regressive, partial and Total) that calculate the distances by means of GPS. It also shows the current speed of the vehicle (obtained by GPS), which will be of great help especially those cars that do not have a speedometer to not exceed the speed limits in the road sections.\n\nThe second screen helps us in the special stages. It has a chronometer with different starting possibilities. Allows to save and compare splits between the different runs by the same special stage. And it also has a total trip and a regressive one.\n\nA third screen helps us to calculate a forecast of the fuel consumption until the next refuelling, distinguishing between kilometers and consumptions of road section and special stages."

Anytime you want to work on your stickhandling just pull out your phone and get training. \n\nThe app keeps track of your \"DangleTime\" which is the amount of time you spend practicing using the app. This time can be shared and compared with friends. Who can get the highest DangleTime? The higher your DangleTime the more you can level up, go from a Duster to an All-Star!\n\nThe app comes with 3 free training packs. Each training pack contains 8 stickhandling drills. When you select a training pack a drill will play for 20 seconds with a 10 second break and then the next drill will play until all drills in that pack have played. These times can be adjusted in the settings menu. \n\nIf you'd like more stickhandling drills you can purchase them and continue to challenge yourself and improve your stickhandling. \nAll drills are demonstrated by Jeremy Rupke from How To Hockey with plans to add new drill packs from more hockey instructors. \n\nShow me your DangleTime with #DangleTime on Instagram and Twitter and follow me @howtohockey"

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

She is in her mid-forties and lives alone. James had never thought of her like that before he had accidentally seen her hot naked body in the laundry room.\n\n-- Lucy has always been a good girl, and from day one, her parents have taught her that the most valuable asset she can offer the world is her purity. Her innocence. One can only imagine how enraged and offended her parents would be if they found out.\n\n-- When Amber's mother announced that she would remarry, Amber knew her feelings for James, her future stepfather, were inappropriate. She tried to push her fantasies to older students at the college, but none of them ever seemed to satisfy her. Maybe it was the lack of a father figure in her life, but she was drawn to James almost immediately. \n\nMANAGE YOUR STORIES\n• Create your own collection of favorites and come back to read them anytime you want\n• Switch between light and dark mode\n• Increase or reduce the text size \n\nSPECIAL IN-APP FEATURES\n• Enjoy piquant background pictures that create a perfect lustful atmosphere\n• Set up a screen lock to unlock all Sensual content if needed\n• Landscape mode and iPad optimization \n\n--PRICING--\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nAuto-renewable monthly subscriptions covering all features.\n\nONE-TIME PURCHASE\nConvenient coin packages for all extra features and content.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase based on your subscription plan.

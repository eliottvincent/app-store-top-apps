      "label": "Book Track is an iPhone, iPad, and Mac app that can track your books — both the ones you own and the ones you hope to own in the future.\n\nAvid readers know how difficult it can be to keep tabs on a growing book collection and that's where Book Track comes into its own by making it quicker and easier than ever to track your reading. Not only can you track all of the books that you own, as well as how far you've read, but you can also keep a wishlist of the books that you'd like to pick up in the future. Whether a book is in your 'Library' or your 'Wishlist,' Book Track displays information and gorgeous cover art for all of them. While Book Track uses information from the internet, more obscure books can also be added manually, too.\n\nBook Track is a free app and is limited to 5 books. A single in-app purchase unlocks support for unlimited books across iPhone and iPad. A separate purchase is required to unlock the full Mac app.\n\nBook Track users can look forward to:\n\n- A synchronized list of books and information — whether you save a book on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, it'll be synced across all devices. Both your Library and Wishlist will be synced seamlessly and automatically so you'll never lose a book again — or buy the same book twice because you forgot you already own it!\n\n- Easy and comprehensive book organization — Every book you add to your Library can be marked as read, reading, or unread, with each book also supporting tags to help you find similar books throughout your collection. Book information like title, author, description, publisher, year of publication, genre, and even the description can also be edited to make your Library as accurate or personal as possible.\n\n- Quote saving — Find a passage within a book that you want to save for later? Book Track can save your favorite quotes in one place so you can read them again later. You can even put them on your Home screen using a widget.\n\n- All the stats, right where you'll see them — Book Track collects library and reading statistics and puts them right on your Home screen with gorgeous widgets. iPad users can enjoy an extra large widget with even more stats, too!\n\n- Support for importing books from services like Goodreads, BookBuddy, Reading List, and more — It's never been easier to import your books from other apps and services so you don't have to start building your library all over again. Book collections can also be exported to PDF and CSV as well.\n\n- Deep integration with iOS and macOS — Book Track includes support for the latest Apple features including Shortcuts and Siri, while Widgets can be used to put your favorite quotes right onto your Home screen.\n\n- Privacy — Book Track doesn't collect any of your personal data and doesn't track you in any way. Books should be fun, not another reason to worry about your data privacy."

You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "\"Learning a language is hard. Studying a foreign language requires hundreds of hours in a time-starved world. Prismatext meets you where you are, and offers an effortless method for learning a language: recreational reading!\n\nUsing an innovative method called \"\"diglot weave,\"\" Prismatext books blend foreign words and phrases into classic literature for context-based language learning.\n\nAt the start of a Prismatext book, you'll be reading in English. Very shortly thereafter, you'll be reading in English and a little bit of your target language. Prismatext will begin replacing words and phrases with their translations—not too many, of course, but enough for you to notice. If you get stuck, give the words a tap to bring up their footnote: you'll find their meaning there, as well as a way to hear those same words spoken.\n\nThe more you read, the more new words you'll discover. Prismatext introduces new words incrementally, allowing you to grow your vocabulary gradually. As you go, you may find yourself using the footnotes less and less. You'll be introduced to—and learn—hundreds of new words and phrases. By the end of the book, you may not even need the footnotes. And if you do, that's fine. Every great journey needs footnotes.\n\n==========\n\nPRISMATEXT WORKS\n• Numerous peer-reviewed studies from around the world agree: diglot weave is one of the most effective learning methods for foreign language vocabulary retention\n• Beginners welcome! The Prismatext experience is seamless and effortless\n\n==========\n\nLEARN 15 LANGUAGES\nArabic, Chinese (simplified), Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish\n\nYOUR PACE\nRead at exactly the same speed you would a standard book\n\nUSEFUL VOCABULARY\nPrismatext analyzes each book individually, and selects useful words and phrases from each one\n\nHEAR IT SPOKEN\nIn-app audio pronunciations keep you from guessing how words sound\n\nSAVE IMPORTANT WORDS\nHang on to notable translations and their context in the book, or share them with friends\n\nREGULAR UPDATES\nPrismatext books improve with time. Your bookshelf can only get better!\n\nOFFLINE READING\nOnce a book is downloaded, it can be read offline.\n\n==========\n\nYou will need to purchase books from the Prismatext bookstore.\""

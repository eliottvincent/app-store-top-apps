Kindle Vella and In-App purchase of Tokens are currently only available in the US. \n\nGO BEYOND PAPER\nTurn your iPhone or iPad into a book with the free Kindle app—so you can read anytime, anywhere. Explore these reading features in the Kindle app:\n\n• Read your way. Customize your text size, font type, margins, text alignment, and orientation (portrait or landscape)—and choose whether to turn pages from left to right or continuously scroll. Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "Guru Granth Sahib is the religious scripture of Sikhism, regarded by Sikhs as the final, sovereign, and eternal living Guru following the lineage of the ten human Gurus of the Sikh religion. Adi Granth, the first rendition, was compiled by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, added one salok, dohra mahala 9 ang, 1429 and all 115 hymns of Guru Tegh Bahadur. This second rendition came to be known as Sri Guru Granth Sahib.\n\nThe text consists of 1430 angs (pages) and 6,000 shabads (line compositions), which are poetically rendered and set to a rhythmic ancient north Indian classical form of music. The bulk of the scripture is divided into thirty-one ragas, with each Granth raga subdivided according to length and author. The hymns in the scripture are arranged primarily by the ragas in which they are read. The Guru Granth Sahib is written in the Gurmukhi script, in various languages, including Lahnda (Western Punjabi), Braj Bhasha, Khariboli, Sanskrit, Sindhi, and Persian. Copies in these languages often have the generic title of Sant Bhasha.\n\nGuru Granth Sahib was composed by seven Sikh Gurus: Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Angad Dev, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan Dev, Guru Hargobind and Guru Tegh Bahadur. Guru Gobind Singh added 1 sloakh in mahala 9 Ang 1429. It also contains the traditions and teachings of Indian sants (saints), such as Ravidas, Ramananda, Kabir and Namdev among others, and two Muslim Sufi saints Bhagat Bhikan and Sheikh Farid.\n\nThe vision in the Guru Granth Sahib is of a society based on divine justice without oppression of any kind."

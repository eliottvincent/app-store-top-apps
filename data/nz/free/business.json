The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly.

      "label": "Get Power Apps to conveniently access your work or school apps no matter where you are: at home, on the road, in the field, off-campus, at the airport, or at the beach – anywhere life takes you.\r\n\r\nWHAT’S INSIDE\r\n\r\nThe Power Apps app is the front door to the apps at your work or school. Which apps can you use? It depends on what’s been created for you. Here are some examples you might see, or ones you can make yourself using the Power Apps website:\r\n\r\n• Campus app: Map your campus with icons for landmarks and facility details.\r\n• Event registration app: Record attendees as they arrive using barcodes or QR codes.\r\n• Expenses app: Let employees submit their expenses and upload photos of receipts.\r\n• Health clinic app: Let patients check in to appointments with just a few taps.\r\n• NFC reader app: Scan NFC tags on ID cards, equipment, packages, etc.\r\n• Performance app: Visualize data and get insights with interactive dashboards.\r\n• Sales app: See opportunities and leads, review comments, and approve for your P&L.\r\n• Space planning app: Take 3D measurements and manipulate objects in mixed reality.\r\n• Timesheet app: Collect, consolidate, and analyze shift data from employees.\r\n\r\nThis is just a handful of examples; the possibilities are endless. Build and share low-code apps for your work or school at the Power Apps website.\r\n\r\nTIPS\r\n\r\n• Swipe right to make an app a favorite, swipe left to add a shortcut to the home screen.\r\n• As an admin, mark an app as Featured, so that it stays pinned to the top of the apps list.\r\n• Some apps can work offline, and Power Apps will sync your data when you reconnect.\r\n\r\nAccessibility: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121429"

Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

      "label": "Blip is a free app for BrightHR customers. It lets you easily track your employees’ work hours and locations on the go. Here’s how it works: \n\nGeolocation \nUse the app to create a geofence—a virtual boundary—around your workplace. Then, when your employees enter or leave the geofence, Blip picks up their location and asks them to clock in or out, helping you to know exactly where your staff have worked and how long for. \n\nQR codes \nAlternatively, you can use Blip’s smart scanning system to record your employees’ work hours instead. \nYour staff use Blip to scan a QR code—a type of barcode—when they arrive and leave work. Then, each time they scan the code, Blip will register them as clocked in or out. It’s that simple. \n\nBreaks\nBlip makes it easy to track breaks, too. At the tap of a button, your staff can log the start and end of their breaks, so you can see how long and how often they take downtime.  \n\nHow Blip helps you:\n    -    Check your employees’ work hours and track their location in an instant. \n    -    Keep an eye on your employees’ breaks and make sure they’re getting enough downtime. \n    -    Change an incorrect shift or break time in a few quick taps.\n    -    Create multiple locations and easily track where your employees have worked.\n    -    View a full history of an employee’s work hours and filter the date range easily.\n    -    Export the work history for an individual or team and save it as a spreadsheet for your records."

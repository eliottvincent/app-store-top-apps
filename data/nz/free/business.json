The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

Driversnote records your trip from start to finish using your phone’s GPS.\n - Never forget to log a trip again, just enable our Auto Tracking and, all your trips will automatically be logged in the background. Just keep the phone in your pocket.\n - Forgot a trip? No problem, you can always manually add a trip later on. Simply select where the trip started and ended and we’ll calculate a route.\n\n\n▶ 2. CLASSIFY: Log who you visited & the purpose\n\n - Easily categorize your trips as business or private.\n - Start and stop destinations are automatically logged, and you can easily name your locations. We’ll even suggest frequented locations nearby, so you simply select the one you visited.\n - When returning to the same place the app automatically finds previous locations nearby - which saves you time.\n - Do you need to keep a mileage log for multiple vehicles or report mileage to more than one employer? No problem! You can easily split your trips and reports for different vehicles and workplaces.\n\n\n▶ 3. REPORT: Easily submit your tax compliant logbook\n\n - Your mileage documentation is ready when you are. You’re only one click away from detailed reports available on your phone or desktop. Download as a PDF or Excel file, ready to hand over to your employer or accountant at your convenience.\n - We create a complete, detailed report that can be given to your local tax authority (e.g. IRS) as documentation for reimbursement claims or tax deductions.\n - Do you need to log your car’s odometer? We’ve got you covered. You decide how often you log your odometer and we do all the math between trips. You can set the app to remind you daily, weekly or monthly.\n\n\n▶ COUNTRY SUPPORT & MILEAGE RATES\n\n - We primarily support the following countries: USA (IRS), Canada (CRA), Australia (ATO), United Kingdom (HMRC), Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. But our system is used in more than 50 countries.\n - Driversnote automatically calculates reimbursements based on the current mileage rates from your local tax authority (that we make sure to keep up-to-date).\n - You can set your own custom reimbursement rates or opt-out of calculating reimbursements altogether.\n\n\n▶ YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT\n\n - All your data is secured on your online account and is always available even if you lose your phone.\n - You can easily manage everything from our website. From here you can access your trips, manage your locations etc. and print reports or download them as PDF or Excel.\n\n\n▶ AUTO TRACKING WITH IBEACON\n\n - Place a Driversnote iBeacon in your car and the app will automatically record all your trips in the background. You will never forget to log a trip again.\n - When you sign up for the annual basic subscription we’ll send you an iBeacon for free. \n - Your phone connects to the iBeacon when you enter the vehicle, and starts recording as you begin your drive. \n - The app stops recording when you exit your vehicle, and you’ll get a notification that the trip was logged.\n\n\n▶ SUPPORT\n\n - If you have questions or feedback please contact us at tel. (+45) 71 99 37 54 or support@driversnote.com.\n - We do use the GPS in the background when logging a trip, and continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n\nHappy tracking!"

Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you. Microsoft, your network provider, and your device’s manufacturer do not know how Intune will be used by your organization."

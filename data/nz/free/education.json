      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

Ako Tahi re-enforces learning through touch, vision, listening, speaking and by challenging yourself and others.\n\nPlease note: this is not a direct translation App; you cannot type any word/sentence in Te reo Māori to receive a full translation. This App contains a list of predefined words/sentences and will only show the results of the words/sentences that are in the App/Database.\n\nAll phrases and words have been approved by people who are fluent in Te Reo Māori, however we also understand there are other dialects, pronunciation of words and other factors that could differ throughout Aotearoa (New Zealand).\n\nNgāpuhi is a Māori iwi (tribe) associated with the Northland region of New Zealand and centred in the Hokianga, the Bay of Islands, and Whangarei. The Ngāpuhi Dialect has been chosen for use throughout this App.\n\nAll content on this App is free to use for any purpose.\n\nI hope this app helps with your journey in learning the Māori Language.\n\nNgā mihi nui"

      "label": "iNaturalist is a social network for sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. The primary goal is to connect people to nature, and the secondary goal is to generate scientifically valuable biodiversity data from these personal encounters. \n\niNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals with visually similar suggestions and verification by dedicated contributors. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you'll create research-quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n• Identification suggestions: Take or import a photo and view the top 10 most visually similar species matches and tap through to get more information. You can view these suggestions even before creating an account.\n• Feedback from our community: Create an account to share your observations and start a conversation about what you saw. Can’t identify the organism? Start with a broad identification like “plants” or “fungi” so others with more expertise can find it and refine the identification. \n• Keep a record of all living things: Build your life list by posting to iNaturalist. Where, when, and what you saw is the basis of each observation you create.\n• Grounded in science: Every identification is connected to the tree of life, which means you can search for broad classifications like “Ferns” or “Fungi” as well as species-level identifications like “Humpback Whale” (and everything in between). \n• Advancing science & conservation: Millions of observations created and identified by the iNaturalist community are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility where they are used to advance scientific understanding of biodiversity through open data and open science. \n• Enabling citizen science and community science: Join any of the tens of thousands of projects around the world on iNaturalist to draw attention to and collect data about particular species or places.\n• Not-for-profit: iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, both 501(c)3 nonprofits in the United States. iNaturalist is free for anyone to use thanks to the generous support of many organizations and individuals. Thank you!\n• No hidden charges: This app is truly free because we believe nature is for everyone.\n• Best for wild plants and animals: The iNaturalist community is better at identifying wild plants and animals than those in gardens or horticulture. Get outside and find what’s wild!\n• Control how your location is shared: Set the privacy to obscured (only general location is shared) or private (no location is shared at all, but much harder for others to help identify). The locations of species at risk from disturbance are automatically obscured.\n• More than a mobile app: iNaturalist has even more extensive features and tools for learning and exploration. Get the full experience at inaturalist.org!\n• 35+ languages: iNaturalist has been translated into dozens of languages thanks to multilingual enthusiasts who want to see the community grow.\n• A global network: iNaturalist is used in every country on earth! In many countries, we have formal agreements with local organizations to promote iNaturalist. Use this app for contributing to all iNaturalist Network sites, including Naturalista (Mexico and Colombia), iNaturalist.NZ (New Zealand), iNaturalist.ca (Canada), Biodiversity4All (Portugal), iNaturalistAU (Australia), iNaturalistPa (Panama), iNaturalistEc (Ecuador), ArgentiNat (Argentina), iNaturalistil (Israel), and iNaturalistFi (Suomi/Finland)."

      "label": "When you start learning te reo Māori, fear of mispronunciation can be one of the greatest barriers to you actually speaking it. Rongo gives you an opportunity to practice in a private space without the pressure and fear of being judged or annoying or offending people. \n\nRongo is best for beginner speakers of te reo Māori as a tool to support their language learning journey. Intermediate and proficient speakers might still find it useful to see if they have formed any ‘bad habits’ along the way. \n\nIn the houses of learning of long ago, students would sit in the darkness while the tohunga (expert) would recite lines of genealogy that spanned many generations. The students would learn by focussing on the words, retaining that knowledge and practice by reciting it themselves. Rongo aims to recreate this experience.By stripping away the written word, you must focus on the sounds of the language and work towards reproducing them, without being influenced by what you have read and, therefore, your existing bank of sound knowledge\n \nLike the whakatauākī of the late Te Wharehuia Milroy, a champion and master of te reo Māori, “Whakahokia te reo mai i te mata o te pene, ki te mata o te arero,' (Bring the language back from the tip of the pen to the tip of the tongue). To reach this goal of speaking te reo Māori, not reading or writing, Rongo can help overcome the barrier that fear of mispronunciation can create. \n\nThis can be a difficult process or method, but with patience and mindfulness you will master the sounds while also growing your confidence. \n\nYou will receive real-time feedback and be prompted to repeat and practice the words and phrases to improve your pronunciation. With over 230 phrases across 24 levels, you will master basic sounds and move to more complex sound combinations. \n\nWe encourage you to find a quiet, comfortable space to practice. For example, lie down on the couch with the phone resting on your chest and close your eyes. Or find that quiet spot in your garden, anywhere you feel relaxed. With Rongo, you can just focus on yourself, your learning, your journey.\n\nMā te rongo ka mōhio, mā te mōhio ka mārama, mā te mārama ka mātau, mā te mātau ka ora!\nThrough listening comes awareness; through awareness comes understanding; through understanding comes knowledge; through knowledge comes life and well being.\n\nIf you are an organisation that is interested in a customised experience and an app that uses words and phrases that are tailored to your industry, please feel free to contact us: awhina@rongo.app"

It’s really easy to use – just take a photo of an everyday object (or upload your own) and see it translated in real time. You can save the translated image, share it or have another go.\n\nAs Kupu relies on the latest Machine Learning technology it may not get it right every time, but we’re working hard to improve it. You can help us by using the Translation Feedback feature to log any translations that don’t seem right.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using Kupu to explore the world of te reo Māori.\n\nFor a more comprehensive te reo Māori learning experience, check out http://maoridictionary.co.nz\n\nTe Aka Māori Dictionary is a product of the life’s work of Professor John C. Moorfield (1943 – 2018). A humble and unassuming man of Pākehā descent, Prof. Moorfield was highly respected in the Māori community, and was affectionately known as Te Murumāra. Without John’s advocacy and dedication to the revitalisation of the Māori language we would not have such a comprehensive and rich resource to draw on."

Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture. In contrast to a geo-cache or a scavenger hunt Actionbound requires the players to create their own content."

      "label": "Frustrated by the amount of your child’s screen time? Wish they were more motivated to learn? We can help! The 1Question app is a new approach to managing screen time, which helps make screen time productive and makes learning fun. \n\n1Question is a fun, educational app for kids in which they learn to earn recreational screen time. Parents control the learning topics and get real-time progress reports.\n\n1Question requires kids to answer study questions, in a game-like format, to earn screen time. The app makes mastering Maths, English, and other educational material as easy as learning the latest TikTok moves. It was created by parents and teachers making it easy to use, plus it’s backed by research to help motivate learning and maximize engagement. And on top of that, it helps to reduce arguments over screen time! \n\nMuch like sneaking vegetables into a cake, 1Question is sneaking micro-learning moments into your child’s screen time. Our award-winning app gives parents control over screen time by setting a study-to-playtime ratio and delivering learning games to kids. \n\nIt’s so beautifully simple, we can’t imagine any parent not wanting to download 1Question. \n\nTHE BENEFITS OF USING 1QUESTION:\n- Enables micro-learning opportunities through screen time\n- Allows parents to select learning topics that benefit their child\n- Deciding on settings with your child creates a positive learning experience\n- Provides you with insights about your child’s learning and ways you can support them\n- Delivers fun, learning games to your child\n\nSTAY IN THE LOOP\n- You can easily get a birds-eye view of all of your children in one place, pinpointing topics they’re ahead with, and ones where they need a helping hand.\n\nPOSITIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCES\n- Our AI‘s advanced logic charts a customised pathway through the content, built to reinforce the strengths and nurture the weaknesses of each child – so every 1Question really counts.\n- 1Question integrates micro-learning moments into the way children already use their devices.\n- It helps children and their families build positive reinforcement and share every win together.\n\nPARENTAL CONTROL OVER SCREEN TIME\n1Question gives parents control over how screen time is spent\n- you choose which apps or app categories kids can unlock when screen time has been earned\n- the app sets the recreational to screen time ratio\n\nFAMILY UNITY\n- If you’re a parent or guardian, you know that complete restriction doesn’t always get results. 1Question doesn’t block apps – it uses flash card style questions to unlock apps!\n- Reduce arguments over screen time.\n\nLEARNING TOPICS:\n1Question’s range of curriculum-aligned topics continues to grow, but here’s a selection of our current mathematics options.\n- Addition/subtraction\n- Place value\n- Multiplication\n- Odd/even numbers\n- Roman numerals\n- Fractions\n- Geometry\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n- Minimum iOS 16 for iPhone or iPadOS 16 for iPad\n- At least one device your child accesses\n\nGETTING STARTED:\n1.

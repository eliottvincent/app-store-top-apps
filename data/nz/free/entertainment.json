Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\n\nA safer online experience for kids\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\n\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”.\n\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.\n\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of kids\nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.\n\nOther important information:\nParental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.\nYour kid may also see videos with commercial content from YouTube creators that are not paid ads.The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts managed with Family Link describes our privacy practices when your kid uses YouTube Kids with their Google Account.

See private content and chat with your favorite creators!\n\n*Liking*\nLiking your favorite creators’ posts is one way to put your name on their map. Liking lets creators know who their biggest fans are—the more you Like, the more likely it is you’ll catch a creator’s eye.\n\nSometimes creators offer their content a la carte, where you can like to unlock their more exclusive content without committing to a monthly subscription.\n\n*Tipping*\nAttach tips to your DMs and comments using Sunbeams — Sunroom’s in-app currency. Tips help you to stand out, and they’re a more intimate way of letting creators know you appreciate their time and creative energy.\n\n*Memberships*\nBecome a paying member for access to exclusive content from creators, and to DM and comment without having to tip. Earn a Top Member badge by being in the top 1% of a creator's supporters. Grab a Day 1 badge for supporting a creator in their first month on Sunroom, or a Streak badge for interacting with a creator for 5 or more days.\n\nCREATORS\nSunroom is a space that gives women and non-binary creators more control and more freedom. We’re welcoming in a new era of zero-cares woman power, and creating a community around celebrated self-expression. We want our creators to get rich from following their frequency, because making money on your own terms is a form of liberation and we believe there’s no shame in putting a price on your time and content.\n\nWe’re called Sunroom because being in here feels like one: warm, safe, and fully seen. SunBlock — our anti-screenshot technology — prevents content leaks and keeps Sunroom private.\n\nJOIN US\nContent on Sunroom spans a range of categories including body-positivity, beauty, entrepreneurship, family, fashion, identity, relationships, food, sex, and self-work. If you’re a creator with an engaged audience and the drive to monetize, download the app and complete the quick creator application. We welcome bodies of all kinds and we aim to include creators of all backgrounds."

      "label": "See the record-shattering series about Jesus that has a 9.9 on IMDb. Watch full episodes, stream on your iPhone, iPad or cast to your TV — nothing required!\n\nThe Chosen is the first-ever multi-season TV show about the life of Jesus. Created outside of the Hollywood system, The Chosen allows us to see Him through the eyes of those who knew Him. No matter where you are in your journey with Jesus Christ, this TV show is for you.\n\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR\n\nI’ve been a believer my whole life, I’ve attended Christian schools my whole life, and I’ve heard the stories of Jesus countless times. I’ve also seen every Jesus movie and miniseries ever made, and there have been dozens. So why a new TV show about Jesus?\n\nBecause I have a passion for people to hear the “old, old story” again … for the very first time. When I see Jesus movies, it’s sometimes hard for me to feel moved or excited. I've heard the stories before, and many Jesus projects just take you from Bible story to Bible story, not spending as much time on the humanity and backstories of all these characters. And they sometimes feel stiff and formal.\n\nSo when we started to write a show that explores Jesus through the eyes of those around Him, we were repeatedly moved and excited. We explored the backstories of Simon Peter, Matthew, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, and a few of Jesus’ miracle recipients, and in turn experienced Him in the way they did. We couldn’t help but identify with their recklessness, rough pasts, religious piety, and desperation for life change. And ultimately, their redemption.\n\nOne of our favorite responses from an early screening? \"The story of Jesus that actually appealed to my teenagers!\"\nNo matter where you’re at in your journey with Christ—whether you’re one of the many people in the gospels who encountered Jesus after a horrific past without Him, or you’re a Nicodemus who’s been a lifelong member of the God team—Jesus proved over and over that we have so much to learn and innumerable traits that need change.\n\nWe hope this show allows you to see Jesus as they did."

      "label": "Each cat has their own unique vocabulary that they use to communicate with their owners consistently when in the same context. For example, a cat can have their own distinct meow for “food” or for “let me out.” This is not necessarily a cat language, as cats do not share the same meows to communicate the same things with each other, but we can use Machine Learning to recognise an individual cat’s meows and translate that into a human readable language. MeowTalk gives your cat a voice!\n\nUsing Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to decode cat communications, MeowTalk instantaneously interprets cat talk into one of eleven general cat intents; the intents represent cat moods and states of mind and are as follows:\n\n- Happy/Content\n- Defense\n- Angry\n- Attack\n- Mother Call\n- Mating Call\n- In Pain\n- Resting\n- Hunting\n- Warning\n- Give Me Attention\n\nThe free app version includes access to the translation mode with three basic meow intents. If you use the free version and your cat's meow does not belong to one of the free intents, it will be blurred. MeowTalk Premium subscription allows you to access all meow intents and translations. \n\nMeowTalk Premium also allows you to train the app to learn your cat’s unique vocabulary, use Auto-translate mode, keep track of your cat’s meow translation history, and store the precious audio recordings of the meows on your device. \n\nEach cat also has a unique vocabulary of meows. With a Premium subscription, you can train the MeowTalk app to learn your cat’s unique vocabulary of meows by telling the app what each meow means when your cat makes it. To train the app to learn a specific meow, pick a context where you know with certainty what your cat is trying to say (e.g. at feeding time the cat is saying “food”, at the door the cat is saying “let me out”). Use the app to translate those meows. You will get one of the 11 general intents as a translation - select “No, Change it”, and then provide the correct translation. Repeat this 5 to 10 times and wait up to 24 hours for the app to update and learn your cat’s vocabulary.\n\nMeowTalk Premium includes an ability to turn your old phone into a smart speaker for cats when you run MeowTalk on it in MeowRoom mode. MeowRoom continuous cat listening can be activated in a MeowTalk app installed on an older or spare smartphone plugged into the wall outlet, so this smart cat speaker always listens for and translates cat meows. Any primary phone logged in with the same MeowTalk account will also get a notification of the meow translation captured by MeowRoom, which enables users to enjoy cat meow moments even when they are not home. \n\nReach out to the MeowTalk Team anytime with ideas or issues at info@meowtalk.app\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYNk0fDMtdo\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/science/cats-pets-ommunication-artificial-intelligence.html \n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.meowtalk.app/privacy-policy\n\nTerms of Service:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nMeowTalk Subscription is a monthly subscription service that allows you to remove the blurred translations and network ads, access the meow translation history, download the audio recordings, use MeowRoom mode, and more. Subscription costs 2.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and will be charged to your iTunes Account after purchase and when the subscription renews monthly.\n\nSubscriptions will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\n\nSubscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period."

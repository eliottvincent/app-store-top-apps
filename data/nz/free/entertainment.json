Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\n\nA safer online experience for kids\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\n\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”.\n\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.\n\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of kids\nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.\n\nOther important information:\nParental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.\nYour kid may also see videos with commercial content from YouTube creators that are not paid ads.The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts managed with Family Link describes our privacy practices when your kid uses YouTube Kids with their Google Account. When your kid uses YouTube Kids without signing into their Google Account, the YouTube Kids Privacy Notice applies."

Or is being culturally competent just become a box ticking exercise? Let’s find out shall we.\n\nMeet Auraki - our AR cultural accountant.\n\nAuraki will challenge some of the biggest media organisations in the country , via a digital art demonstration that we warmly ask them to be a part of.\nThe wero will consist of Auraki waiting outside these select organisations buildings to be invited in . If let in we will leave this art piece inside the whare to better learn from the environment and the people who work in these spaces.\n\nAuraki will then potentially offer some creative tools and kōrero to help manaaki their staff in terms of having a better understanding of te Ao Māori and why being more culturally aware benefits everyone in the long run . This is not to censor their mahi only to manaaki them around our world and why we think the way we do.\n\nThe Hori Label was created in 2012 and since then has been the centre of much artistic and social debate. It was developed in order to draw attention to significant issues in Aotearoa that I feel close to. The goal is to create awareness and to open up difficult conversations about difficult and often taboo subjects. Like our nations Haka, Hori looks to challenge people’s views even when it may not seem politically correct to do so."

      "label": "* First Ever Celebrity Voice Changer® * \n* Join 25 Million People *\n\n\n\n\nCelebrity Voice Changer lets you change your voice to any celebrity voice instantly, just by talking into a mic. This is not a cheap voice effect, like other voice changers on the market.\n\nIf you've tried voice changers in the past, you've probably encountered voice changers that simply change the pitch or speed of your voice, or put a horrible echo effect or \"dry\" your voice using a frequency gate or other very simple effect... That is not us, we are the real deal. Try our celebrity voice changer for yourself.\n\nFor the first time, you can say anything you want in English, and have it spoken back to you by a huge group of celebrity A-listers.\n\n\n\nTo use the app, make sure you have an Internet connection, then Tap and Speak into the microphone. It will automatically detect silence.  It should only take a few seconds at most to generate a video of your changed voice back to you. You can then share the video (which contains your changed voice).\n\n\n\nLegal Notice: ALL ORIGINAL CONTENT and ARTWORK - NO IMPLIED AFFILIATION or ENDORSEMENT - NO CELEBRITY NAMES or LIKENESS - IMPRESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PARODY - VOICES ARE ONLY IMPRESSIONS - NOT A SOUNDBOARD - Celebrity Voice Changer is meant to be used as a parody and to create parody. HatsOfApps is not claiming an affiliation with any celebrity who is being parodied. All content within Celebrity Voice Changer is original, and there are no Celebrity or Brand names; only our poor impressions.\n\nHatsOffApps uses user-generated content to create the technology and to create user-generated voice changers.\n\n\n\nFAQ:\n\n*Can I request a new voice?\n\nYes! Tweet it and ask us in your comments (we read them), we will focus on the most requested voices, so get your friends to request Voice Changer Voices too!\n\n*Sometimes it is perfect, but sometimes I don't understand what it is saying, can you make it better?\n\nYes, and we are working on it. Our Deep Learning Technology automatically learns and does impressions of celebrity voices without any human training. The technology is not perfect yet, but we're getting there. With your support we will continue working until the voices are indistinguishable from human voice. We are also working on real-time voice changer technology in conjunction with our partner. Our technology makes it possible to change the voice, not just disguise the voice or change your voice to an FX chain that makes it sound like a monster or a chipmunk.\n\n*Can you do a particular celebrity voice?\n\nYes. We can do any voice. Our partner's technology is learning to do impressions of humans by listening to tens of thousands of hours of human speech. We use a proprietary neural network that turns a human voice into a voice font, or text to speech voice. In order for us to do impressions, we need audio to create celebrity voice impressions. Soon, we will make available our partner's community on our website and upload any voice impressions for us to use to make voices.\n\nFor licensing inquiries and API key requests, please reach out.\n\nPayment and Subscription Information:\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n• Visit our Privacy Policy at: http://www.celebrityvoicechanger.com/privacy\n• View our Terms of Service at: http://celebrityvoicechanger.com/tos/"

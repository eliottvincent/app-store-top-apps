Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\n\nA safer online experience for kids\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\n\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”.\n\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.\n\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of kids\nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.\n\nOther important information:\nParental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.\nYour kid may also see videos with commercial content from YouTube creators that are not paid ads.The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts managed with Family Link describes our privacy practices when your kid uses YouTube Kids with their Google Account. When your kid uses YouTube Kids without signing into their Google Account, the YouTube Kids Privacy Notice applies."

      "label": "See the record-shattering series about Jesus that has a 9.9 on IMDb. Watch full episodes, stream on your iPhone, iPad or cast to your TV — nothing required!\n\nThe Chosen is the first-ever multi-season TV show about the life of Jesus. Created outside of the Hollywood system, The Chosen allows us to see Him through the eyes of those who knew Him. No matter where you are in your journey with Jesus Christ, this TV show is for you.\n\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR\n\nI’ve been a believer my whole life, I’ve attended Christian schools my whole life, and I’ve heard the stories of Jesus countless times. I’ve also seen every Jesus movie and miniseries ever made, and there have been dozens. So why a new TV show about Jesus?\n\nBecause I have a passion for people to hear the “old, old story” again … for the very first time. When I see Jesus movies, it’s sometimes hard for me to feel moved or excited. I've heard the stories before, and many Jesus projects just take you from Bible story to Bible story, not spending as much time on the humanity and backstories of all these characters. And they sometimes feel stiff and formal.\n\nSo when we started to write a show that explores Jesus through the eyes of those around Him, we were repeatedly moved and excited. We explored the backstories of Simon Peter, Matthew, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, and a few of Jesus’ miracle recipients, and in turn experienced Him in the way they did. We couldn’t help but identify with their recklessness, rough pasts, religious piety, and desperation for life change. And ultimately, their redemption.\n\nOne of our favorite responses from an early screening? \"The story of Jesus that actually appealed to my teenagers!\"\nNo matter where you’re at in your journey with Christ—whether you’re one of the many people in the gospels who encountered Jesus after a horrific past without Him, or you’re a Nicodemus who’s been a lifelong member of the God team—Jesus proved over and over that we have so much to learn and innumerable traits that need change.\n\nWe hope this show allows you to see Jesus as they did."

The O allows you to ‘Love’ and ‘Hate’ artworks or you can leave comments to really vent your spleen.\n\nRecent features:\n• We no-longer print the visitor guide. It's all on The O including full maps. \n• Join exhibit queues virtually and continue to wander the museum until you're at the front of the queue."

Explore an ever-expanding universe of over 1000 stickers; from Mickey and Minnie Mouse, to Frozen’s Anna and Elsa, from the cast of the Lion King and Toy Story to an array of heroines, heroes, princesses, side-kicks, villains and so many more.\n\nChoose from a selection of brushes, crayons, markers and magic tools to work with (it even supports Apple Pencil). Give Frozen’s Elsa a blazing red dress or Mickey Mouse spotty green ears. How would Simba look with stripes like a zebra? The sky’s the limit! For little hands that might not have mastered the art of coloring yet, there’s even a Magic Color tool that fills in all the colors perfectly. \n\nAnd there’s more! Once a character has been colored and decorated it turns into a sticker that can then be placed and played with in magical 3D sticker books. The sticker books present iconic places from Disney films where kids will discover hidden interactive surprises, adding a sprinkling of magic to their creative play.\n\nEach time a page of characters is completed, even more characters and pages unlocked for endless fun, rewarding kids for their creativity.\n\nDisney Coloring World is a subscription service which gives complete access to all our coloring pages and playsets with exclusive new content every month. \n- Choose to subscribe on a monthly or annual basis.\n- Change your mind at any point.

Lovingly crafted, truly titillating content, guaranteed to satisfy your most carnal needs.\n\nThe app contains 5 couple games adapted to you whether your relationship happens to be lesbian, gay, straight...\n\n● Naughty scenarios ● \n\nBreak the routine with this unique concept: you’ll make your way through stages that progress as you play and are tailored to your sexual orientation. You’ll quickly find yourself swept along by the game - as you move up through the stages, the temperature will steadily rise too… will you make it all the way to the end?\n\n3 free modes are available.\n- “Get me going”: (re)discover some hot foreplay with this (supposedly) softer mode.\n- “Unleash”: a much wilder mode. Pleasure guaranteed, but for the more daring couples.\n- “Fantasy to reality”: a mode specially designed to make your secret turn-ons come to life.\n\n● Wheel to decide ●\n\nLooking for some inspiration in the bedroom? Maybe you’re just always open to new experiences? Well, roll the dice and try out some new positions. Standing, lying down, on your side, on your knees… from the simplest to some truly acrobatic poses, there’s something here for every taste.\n\n● Red-hot dice ●\n\n4 dice to turn up the heat with actions that are as unpredictable as they are dirty. In the hot version they’ll even have you getting right down to business. Apart from from a dirty action to be applied to an erogenous zone, our dice will add an extra challenge and a time limit in which it must be completed.\n\n● A Truth or Dare to play as a couple… or as a group! ●\n\n5 full Truth or Dare modes. From soft to hardcore, and with a mode specially conceived for couples, play the hottest version of your childhood favorite. If you feel like playing with fire, you could invite some friends. Just be careful not to get burnt!\n\n● Dirty Never Have I Ever ●\n\n\n\n● All lovingly crafted by passionate app developers ● \n\nHere at GreenTomatoMedia, we respect your privacy: we refuse to integrate targeted ads and are totally against this as a business model.

Once you've confirmed your order, the payment will be charged to your account, with the right price for your country. The subscription will automatically renew at its end date.

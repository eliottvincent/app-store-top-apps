Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\n\nA safer online experience for kids\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\n\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”.\n\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.\n\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of kids\nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.\n\nOther important information:\nParental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.\nYour kid may also see videos with commercial content from YouTube creators that are not paid ads.The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts managed with Family Link describes our privacy practices when your kid uses YouTube Kids with their Google Account. When your kid uses YouTube Kids without signing into their Google Account, the YouTube Kids Privacy Notice applies."

      "label": "See the record-shattering series about Jesus that has a 9.9 on IMDb. Watch full episodes, stream on your iPhone, iPad or cast to your TV — nothing required!\n\nThe Chosen is the first-ever multi-season TV show about the life of Jesus. Created outside of the Hollywood system, The Chosen allows us to see Him through the eyes of those who knew Him. No matter where you are in your journey with Jesus Christ, this TV show is for you.\n\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR\n\nI’ve been a believer my whole life, I’ve attended Christian schools my whole life, and I’ve heard the stories of Jesus countless times. I’ve also seen every Jesus movie and miniseries ever made, and there have been dozens. So why a new TV show about Jesus?\n\nBecause I have a passion for people to hear the “old, old story” again … for the very first time. When I see Jesus movies, it’s sometimes hard for me to feel moved or excited. I've heard the stories before, and many Jesus projects just take you from Bible story to Bible story, not spending as much time on the humanity and backstories of all these characters. And they sometimes feel stiff and formal.\n\nSo when we started to write a show that explores Jesus through the eyes of those around Him, we were repeatedly moved and excited. We explored the backstories of Simon Peter, Matthew, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, and a few of Jesus’ miracle recipients, and in turn experienced Him in the way they did. We couldn’t help but identify with their recklessness, rough pasts, religious piety, and desperation for life change. And ultimately, their redemption.\n\nOne of our favorite responses from an early screening? \"The story of Jesus that actually appealed to my teenagers!\"\nNo matter where you’re at in your journey with Christ—whether you’re one of the many people in the gospels who encountered Jesus after a horrific past without Him, or you’re a Nicodemus who’s been a lifelong member of the God team—Jesus proved over and over that we have so much to learn and innumerable traits that need change.\n\nWe hope this show allows you to see Jesus as they did."

Explore an ever-expanding universe of over 1000 stickers; from Mickey and Minnie Mouse, to Frozen’s Anna and Elsa, from the cast of the Lion King and Toy Story to an array of heroines, heroes, princesses, side-kicks, villains and so many more.\n\nChoose from a selection of brushes, crayons, markers and magic tools to work with (it even supports Apple Pencil). Give Frozen’s Elsa a blazing red dress or Mickey Mouse spotty green ears. How would Simba look with stripes like a zebra? The sky’s the limit! For little hands that might not have mastered the art of coloring yet, there’s even a Magic Color tool that fills in all the colors perfectly. \n\nAnd there’s more! Once a character has been colored and decorated it turns into a sticker that can then be placed and played with in magical 3D sticker books. The sticker books present iconic places from Disney films where kids will discover hidden interactive surprises, adding a sprinkling of magic to their creative play.\n\nEach time a page of characters is completed, even more characters and pages unlocked for endless fun, rewarding kids for their creativity.\n\nDisney Coloring World is a subscription service which gives complete access to all our coloring pages and playsets with exclusive new content every month. \n- Choose to subscribe on a monthly or annual basis.\n- Change your mind at any point.

      "label": "* First Ever Celebrity Voice Changer® * \n* Join 25 Million People *\n\n\n\n\nCelebrity Voice Changer lets you change your voice to any celebrity voice instantly, just by talking into a mic. This is not a cheap voice effect, like other voice changers on the market.\n\nIf you've tried voice changers in the past, you've probably encountered voice changers that simply change the pitch or speed of your voice, or put a horrible echo effect or \"dry\" your voice using a frequency gate or other very simple effect... That is not us, we are the real deal. Try our celebrity voice changer for yourself.\n\nFor the first time, you can say anything you want in English, and have it spoken back to you by a huge group of celebrity A-listers.\n\n\n\nTo use the app, make sure you have an Internet connection, then Tap and Speak into the microphone. It will automatically detect silence.  It should only take a few seconds at most to generate a video of your changed voice back to you. You can then share the video (which contains your changed voice).\n\n\n\nLegal Notice: ALL ORIGINAL CONTENT and ARTWORK - NO IMPLIED AFFILIATION or ENDORSEMENT - NO CELEBRITY NAMES or LIKENESS - IMPRESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PARODY - VOICES ARE ONLY IMPRESSIONS - NOT A SOUNDBOARD - Celebrity Voice Changer is meant to be used as a parody and to create parody. HatsOfApps is not claiming an affiliation with any celebrity who is being parodied. All content within Celebrity Voice Changer is original, and there are no Celebrity or Brand names; only our poor impressions.\n\nHatsOffApps uses user-generated content to create the technology and to create user-generated voice changers.\n\n\n\nFAQ:\n\n*Can I request a new voice?\n\nYes! Tweet it and ask us in your comments (we read them), we will focus on the most requested voices, so get your friends to request Voice Changer Voices too!\n\n*Sometimes it is perfect, but sometimes I don't understand what it is saying, can you make it better?\n\nYes, and we are working on it. Our Deep Learning Technology automatically learns and does impressions of celebrity voices without any human training. The technology is not perfect yet, but we're getting there. With your support we will continue working until the voices are indistinguishable from human voice. We are also working on real-time voice changer technology in conjunction with our partner. Our technology makes it possible to change the voice, not just disguise the voice or change your voice to an FX chain that makes it sound like a monster or a chipmunk.\n\n*Can you do a particular celebrity voice?\n\nYes.

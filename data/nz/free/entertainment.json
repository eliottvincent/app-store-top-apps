      "label": "A video app made just for kids\nYouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\n\nA safer online experience for kids\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\n\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”.\n\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.\n\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of kids\nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.\n\nOther important information:\nParental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.\nYour kid may also see videos with commercial content from YouTube creators that are not paid ads.The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts managed with Family Link describes our privacy practices when your kid uses YouTube Kids with their Google Account. When your kid uses YouTube Kids without signing into their Google Account, the YouTube Kids Privacy Notice applies."

      "label": "Meet FARM JAM, a brilliant mix of a farming simulator and a parking game. You’ve just bought a ticket for a farm sightseeing… Take your seats, lads, we’re going to the Ol’ Sharpeye’s farmland.\n\nFARM ADVENTURES\n\nThis farm is my life, folks, and I've been living here since the day I remember myself. My parents got this klondike from their parents, and their parents got it from their parents... you get the idea, huh? So yeah, this ranch has been my ol' property for a very long time. Some important hunks from the city tried to buy this harvest land, but they can't fool the Ol' Sharpeye! They laughed at me when I told them about strange things that happen here...\n\n‘CUTE’ ANIMALS\n\nYou won't probably believe me, but I've seen some suspicious pig games... Tourists think that those are just cute farm animals - but they aren't, trust me. I believe that it's the pig who's plotting against me. I wish you'd seen his tricky face - his games start soon, I feel that. If you're not a chicken, come and help me someday - together we'll stop it. \n\nSSH, KEEP THE NOISE DOWN\n\nHey, you! Yes, you! Don't listen to that old killjoy John, he knows nothing about us... Yeah, raise your jaw, I can speak. So, he told you about the animal jam we have here, right? NO? Oh, that’s how things go here, kid. Just like that traffic jam you had on the way here, it’s not very fun when you have too many roommates in a cell that’s called “the farm”. I do know that you won’t let some poor animals in need, right? Good.\n\nDon’t worry, we’ll do it just smooth & easy: I have a plan for that. You’ll manage this great escape. No, put the smartphone aside – there’s no need to make any unnecessary calls right now. So here’s what’s waiting for you in FARM JAM.\n\nYou should send all animals to the right escape zone in the right sequence. Of course, there will be different obstacles on your way: shrubs, barrels, fences. You should change your tactics to cope with that. \n\nSHOW TIME\n\nAnd this is where you step in. Your main objective is to unblock and release all the animals from the farm’s paddock. Keep in mind that animals can move both backward and forward. FARM JAM will bring some intricate moments: all animals have different sizes. This prevents all the easy escape routes, so think carefully and don’t get caught by the Ol’ John. It will make the game flow more challenging. And keep in mind, when the night is coming down, you should act faster. You need to free all the animals before the dark. \n\nFULL FARM FUN PACK\n\n1. Soothing countryside visuals: fields, farms, meadows, forests, ranches await you.\n2. Join the gang: humorous personalities in this casual game won’t just let you go – follow the rules, human, or else.\n3. Form the queue: you should release those animals in a certain order, otherwise, they’ll get stuck and fail the whole escape.\n4. Love is in the air on the farm. Match animals of the same color to make a pair.\n5. A game of challenge: try to slip past the farmer's watchful eye and avoid all the obstacles on the farmyard.\n6. Play it with the sound ON for the fun entertainment experience.\n\nReady to make the escape of the century? Let’s do that. Ultimate playing fun is waiting for you with FARM JAM."

Or is being culturally competent just become a box ticking exercise? Let’s find out shall we.\n\nMeet Auraki - our AR cultural accountant.\n\nAuraki will challenge some of the biggest media organisations in the country , via a digital art demonstration that we warmly ask them to be a part of.\nThe wero will consist of Auraki waiting outside these select organisations buildings to be invited in . If let in we will leave this art piece inside the whare to better learn from the environment and the people who work in these spaces.\n\nAuraki will then potentially offer some creative tools and kōrero to help manaaki their staff in terms of having a better understanding of te Ao Māori and why being more culturally aware benefits everyone in the long run . This is not to censor their mahi only to manaaki them around our world and why we think the way we do.\n\nThe Hori Label was created in 2012 and since then has been the centre of much artistic and social debate. It was developed in order to draw attention to significant issues in Aotearoa that I feel close to. The goal is to create awareness and to open up difficult conversations about difficult and often taboo subjects. Like our nations Haka, Hori looks to challenge people’s views even when it may not seem politically correct to do so."

      "label": "At Mona we don't have wall labels, we have The O. \n\nThe O uses location awareness to locate you in and around the museum and tells you about the work on display. You can choose from ‘Artwank’—a short and pithy, but otherwise traditional, essay; ‘Gonzo’—ramblings from David Walsh and some of his buddies about what the stuff on show means on a more personal level; as well as bite-sized nuggets of info, and interviews with artists. The O allows you to ‘Love’ and ‘Hate’ artworks or you can leave comments to really vent your spleen.\n\nRecent features:\n• We no-longer print the visitor guide. It's all on The O including full maps. \n• Join exhibit queues virtually and continue to wander the museum until you're at the front of the queue."

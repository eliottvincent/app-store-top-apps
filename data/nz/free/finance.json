In a way they understand. We're a Kiwi team on a mission to empower our next generation, by helping them be great with money. We had to learn the hard way, so we want something better for our kids - and yours.\n\nWHY SQUAREONE KIDS ARE GREAT WITH MONEY\n+ Your first card (it's also eco-plastic!) = you get to understand how money works\n+ A personal money app. This is NOT your grandad's bank.\n+ Set savings goals + hit your targets = get what you want + need\n+ Track your spend = Experience money + build lifelong habits of great money management\n+ Check your balance and transactions in real time (+ no nasty overdrafts)\n+ Complete jobs (+ set up your own earning opportunities) to earn extra money\n+ Repay your parents with a tap\n+ Easily freeze your SquareOne card if you lose it (+ it's selfie-ready with no details on the card)\n+ Send + receive money with friends, instantly\n\nAND WHY THEIR PARENTS ARE SO STOKED\n+ Automatic pocket money + instant money transfers = help them experience using money for real\n+ Set spending rules and limits for kids = You create the boundaries\n+ R18 merchants are blocked...how has no one done this yet?\n+ Contactless / online / international payments / friend-2-friend transfers...? You decide.\n+ See recent transactions in real time and monitor their savings goals\n+ Top up with a tap + all your kids in one place\n\nWe're a proud Kiwi fintech. Join us on this mission to uplift + empower our next generation by helping them be great with money. Our founders are 2 mates with young families. As the kids grow up we’re teaching them lots - including teaching them about money. When we were kids we had piggy-banks, savings books and star charts. We could count our money, and see our physical pile of cash and coins break down as we spent. We could also watch it build up as we did jobs and saved…\n\nAnd that’s how it was done for generations. But the move to a cashless world has caught everyone off-guard. Options for youth accounts are limited, and the market’s approach is out of date, and out of touch. So we’re fixing it. For our kids, and yours.\n\nCheers, from the whole SquareOne team."

So Xero has put an extra deadbolt on the door to help keep your data secure. \n\nThis is why Xero uses MFA to secure logins. It significantly reduces the risk of someone gaining access to your account, even if they’ve managed to obtain your email and password through a phishing attack or malware. \n\nThe Xero Verify app is simple to use. You can receive push notifications for fast authentication, instead of having to  open the app and enter a code into Xero when you login. Simply accept the notification on your device’s home screen - it’s that easy.\n\nFeatures:\n* Sign into your Xero account using push notifications on your device (if enabled).\n* Generate six digit verification codes, even if you don’t have a network or mobile connection.\n* Use Xero Verify to authenticate your Xero account (it can’t be used on other products outside Xero)\n* Easy set up using QR code\n\nPermission notice:\nCamera: Needed to add accounts using QR codes\nPush notifications: Accept to receive push notifications \n\nFollow Xero on Twitter: https://twitter.com/xero/\nJoin the Xero Facebook Fan page: https://www.facebook.com/Xero.Accounting\nPrivacy policy: https://www.xero.com/about/legal/privacy/\nTerms of use: https://www.xero.com/about/legal/terms/"

      "label": "The free and easy solution to share your expenses with others. Create or check your tricount now to add your expenses.\n\nUsed by millions of people because short reckonings make long friends :-)!\n\nVery practical for holidays, housesharing, events, couples evenings, etc.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n• A clean and simple interface.\n• If you want, share accounts with a group: everyone will see them and can add their own expenses.\n• Divide expenses unevenly: good for travelling with couples or children, for example.\n• Works with the app and online: accounts are visible in the app, but also online!\n• Works offline to ensure perfect use in every part of the world... even on the beach!\n• You can turn on notifications to see if others are adding or editing expenses, and link your tricount list to your email address.\n\nWHAT USERS SAY:\n\n\"The best expenses app I've ever downloaded. The app is very intuitive\" - Michael P.\n\"Makes sharing bills with friends so much easier, many useful options, an absolute must have.\" - Tom C.\n\"Super useful - my flatmates and I can't live without it anymore!\" Sarah P.\n\nTHEY RECOMMEND TRICOUNT :\n\nFORBES:\n\"With Tricount, you can create a group expense report on your phone. It tracks spending by person, and then splits up how much each individual owes or is owed from the total balance. When you’re ready to share the final breakdown, the app sends each person a link to Tricount’s site to review the data.\"\n\nBUSINESS INSIDER:\n\"Next time you organize a group activity, Tricount will split up the expenses for you\".\n\nABOUT IN-APP PURCHASES\n\nAs of version 2.1, Tricount offers in-App purchase subscriptions valid for one year. \n\nThe price of the subscription is 6.99€ (Premium) and may depend on your territory and is clearly indicated on the subscription page. Payment will be directly charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. The subscription renewal costs the same price as the one of the original subscription. After purchase, you can disable auto-renewal in your user's Account Settings. Note that no cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Tricount's terms and conditions are available at https://tricount.com/en/terms\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\ncreate a tricount, share your link with friends ... et voilà!\n\nTricount makes sorting out and divvying your group expenses very easy when you organize activities (for example: ski trip, citytrip, holidays with a classroom, flatmates etc.)\n\nGone are the days of the old excel file: an easier and effective solution exists to breakdown the costs, sharing expense reports, list tickets and spending. Tricount does the accounting and balances the cost for your group expenses.\n\nIt lets you breakdown the budget of a group and track expenses during a trip or any occasion with friends. It can be used by couples, between colleagues, roommates & flatmates. It is a simple yet powerful tool to figure out who owes what to whom and balance spendings : I owe you, you owe me (IOU) ... so easy!\n\nCreate your group expenses on your mobile (even offline), during your group activity. Send everyone the link (a la Doodle), and your friends too can add their own expense or see your changes.\n\nTricount then tells you who should pay what to whom to balance the group.\n\nVery useful for any activity with friends and colleagues: holiday, city-trip, flat sharing & flatmates, week-ends, everyday lunch with colleagues, parties, etc. In your couple, you can create a tricount to know who has paid what this month, or on holiday.\nThe app exists for most mobile devices, and on the web! All currencies are accepted, even bitcoins if you want."

Self-custodial means not even Bitcoin.com has access to your funds, and you can easily port your assets to another crypto wallet whenever you want. No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password. Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush.

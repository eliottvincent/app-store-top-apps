What's it worth in the real world, and how hard is it to get?\n\nEnter SquareOne: Their first contactless card and account number, with smart parental controls. Pocket money, jobs, savings... In a way they understand. We're a Kiwi team on a mission to empower our next generation, by helping them be great with money. We had to learn the hard way, so we want something better for our kids - and yours.\n\nWHY SQUAREONE KIDS ARE GREAT WITH MONEY\n+ Your first card (it's also eco-plastic!) = you get to understand how money works\n+ A personal money app. This is NOT your grandad's bank.\n+ Set savings goals + hit your targets = get what you want + need\n+ Track your spend = Experience money + build lifelong habits of great money management\n+ Check your balance and transactions in real time (+ no nasty overdrafts)\n+ Complete jobs (+ set up your own earning opportunities) to earn extra money\n+ Repay your parents with a tap\n+ Easily freeze your SquareOne card if you lose it (+ it's selfie-ready with no details on the card)\n+ Send + receive money with friends, instantly\n\nAND WHY THEIR PARENTS ARE SO STOKED\n+ Automatic pocket money + instant money transfers = help them experience using money for real\n+ Set spending rules and limits for kids = You create the boundaries\n+ R18 merchants are blocked...how has no one done this yet?\n+ Contactless / online / international payments / friend-2-friend transfers...? You decide.\n+ See recent transactions in real time and monitor their savings goals\n+ Top up with a tap + all your kids in one place\n\nWe're a proud Kiwi fintech. Join us on this mission to uplift + empower our next generation by helping them be great with money. Our founders are 2 mates with young families. As the kids grow up we’re teaching them lots - including teaching them about money. When we were kids we had piggy-banks, savings books and star charts. We could count our money, and see our physical pile of cash and coins break down as we spent. We could also watch it build up as we did jobs and saved…\n\nAnd that’s how it was done for generations. But the move to a cashless world has caught everyone off-guard. Options for youth accounts are limited, and the market’s approach is out of date, and out of touch. So we’re fixing it. For our kids, and yours.\n\nCheers, from the whole SquareOne team."

They’re also on hand to answer any questions you might have.\n• All that, and we only charge 1% of your income, as you get paid which is also capped at $1,500 bucks a year.\n\nIn short, we take care of all the dull admin stuff that you’re way too busy and important to spend your time on.\n\nThere’s never a bad time to join us, so sign up today, then crack on with what you love doing.\n\nWe’re Hnry, for sole traders."

      "label": "The Bitcoin.com Wallet, trusted by millions, is an easy-to-use, multichain, self-custodial crypto wallet that puts you in full control of all your crypto holdings.\n\nIt allows you to:\n\n- Buy Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), and select ERC-20 tokens quickly and easily via credit card, Apple Pay, and more.\n- Sell BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, and select ERC-20 tokens into your local currency (in select regions).\n- Send, receive, and swap between BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, USDT, USDC, and a huge range of ERC-20 tokens.\n- Access DeFi apps that enable use cases like earning interest on your crypto, borrowing and lending, participating in NFT marketplaces, synthetic assets, and more.\n\nOther key features include:\n\nSELF-CUSTODIAL\n\nYour cryptoassets are ultra-secure because only you can access them. Self-custodial means not even Bitcoin.com has access to your funds, and you can easily port your assets to another crypto wallet whenever you want. No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password. Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

To refill your GPAY wallet you can use your bank accounts (Rocket, AB Bank, Islami bank) or if you don't have an account from these banks then you can visit any MobiCash outlet. For a hassle-free payment, the solution starts using GPay from today and opens the window of opportunities for your time and money."

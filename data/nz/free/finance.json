What's it worth in the real world, and how hard is it to get?\n\nEnter SquareOne: Their first contactless card and account number, with smart parental controls. Pocket money, jobs, savings... In a way they understand. We're a Kiwi team on a mission to empower our next generation, by helping them be great with money. We had to learn the hard way, so we want something better for our kids - and yours.\n\nWHY SQUAREONE KIDS ARE GREAT WITH MONEY\n+ Your first card (it's also eco-plastic!) = you get to understand how money works\n+ A personal money app. This is NOT your grandad's bank.\n+ Set savings goals + hit your targets = get what you want + need\n+ Track your spend = Experience money + build lifelong habits of great money management\n+ Check your balance and transactions in real time (+ no nasty overdrafts)\n+ Complete jobs (+ set up your own earning opportunities) to earn extra money\n+ Repay your parents with a tap\n+ Easily freeze your SquareOne card if you lose it (+ it's selfie-ready with no details on the card)\n+ Send + receive money with friends, instantly\n\nAND WHY THEIR PARENTS ARE SO STOKED\n+ Automatic pocket money + instant money transfers = help them experience using money for real\n+ Set spending rules and limits for kids = You create the boundaries\n+ R18 merchants are blocked...how has no one done this yet?\n+ Contactless / online / international payments / friend-2-friend transfers...? You decide.\n+ See recent transactions in real time and monitor their savings goals\n+ Top up with a tap + all your kids in one place\n\nWe're a proud Kiwi fintech. Join us on this mission to uplift + empower our next generation by helping them be great with money. Our founders are 2 mates with young families. As the kids grow up we’re teaching them lots - including teaching them about money. When we were kids we had piggy-banks, savings books and star charts. We could count our money, and see our physical pile of cash and coins break down as we spent. We could also watch it build up as we did jobs and saved…\n\nAnd that’s how it was done for generations. But the move to a cashless world has caught everyone off-guard. Options for youth accounts are limited, and the market’s approach is out of date, and out of touch. So we’re fixing it. For our kids, and yours.\n\nCheers, from the whole SquareOne team."

It significantly reduces the risk of someone gaining access to your account, even if they’ve managed to obtain your email and password through a phishing attack or malware. \n\nThe Xero Verify app is simple to use. You can receive push notifications for fast authentication, instead of having to  open the app and enter a code into Xero when you login.

Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

Easy.\n• All of this starts with our app. Here you can create invoices (which we’ll even chase for you), get business insights, and raise expenses – which are approved by real people, in real time.\n• Now those real people – they actually become your accountant, which means all your tax returns (including any GST) are filed by us, whenever they’re due. They’re also on hand to answer any questions you might have.\n• All that, and we only charge 1% of your income, as you get paid which is also capped at $1,500 bucks a year.\n\nIn short, we take care of all the dull admin stuff that you’re way too busy and important to spend your time on.\n\nThere’s never a bad time to join us, so sign up today, then crack on with what you love doing.\n\nWe’re Hnry, for sole traders."

It tracks spending by person, and then splits up how much each individual owes or is owed from the total balance. When you’re ready to share the final breakdown, the app sends each person a link to Tricount’s site to review the data.\"\n\nBUSINESS INSIDER:\n\"Next time you organize a group activity, Tricount will split up the expenses for you\".\n\nABOUT IN-APP PURCHASES\n\nAs of version 2.1, Tricount offers in-App purchase subscriptions valid for one year. \n\nThe price of the subscription is 6.99€ (Premium) and may depend on your territory and is clearly indicated on the subscription page. Payment will be directly charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.

Tricount does the accounting and balances the cost for your group expenses.\n\nIt lets you breakdown the budget of a group and track expenses during a trip or any occasion with friends. It can be used by couples, between colleagues, roommates & flatmates. It is a simple yet powerful tool to figure out who owes what to whom and balance spendings : I owe you, you owe me (IOU) ... so easy!\n\nCreate your group expenses on your mobile (even offline), during your group activity. Send everyone the link (a la Doodle), and your friends too can add their own expense or see your changes.\n\nTricount then tells you who should pay what to whom to balance the group.\n\nVery useful for any activity with friends and colleagues: holiday, city-trip, flat sharing & flatmates, week-ends, everyday lunch with colleagues, parties, etc. In your couple, you can create a tricount to know who has paid what this month, or on holiday.\nThe app exists for most mobile devices, and on the web! All currencies are accepted, even bitcoins if you want."

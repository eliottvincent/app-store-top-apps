      "label": "MEATER® is the world’s first Wireless Smart Meat Thermometer that can help you cook meats perfectly every time.\n\nThe MEATER® app, together with the MEATER® meat thermometer (sold separately at https://meater.com/shop) will change the way you cook your meals, and make it a new and exciting experience. Using patented software algorithms, the MEATER® app will give you cook time estimates, and guide you towards the juiciest steak, chicken, turkey, fish or other cut of meat that you've ever cooked.\n\nIt’s time to break free from the kitchen or grill and let the MEATER® app monitor your food for you. When your food is ready, you'll receive audio and visual notifications on your smart device. This way, you can stop watching your food cook, giving you more time to focus on the things that matter the most to you.\n\n* Unlike other smart meat thermometers, MEATER® is completely wireless! All of the electronics are contained inside the MEATER® probe, eliminating the need for any external wires.\n\n* Easily connect up to four MEATER® probes at once to cook every steak exactly the way each person likes them.\n\n* The smart Guided Cook™ system lets you know how long to cook your food, when to remove it from heat, and how long to let it rest. Simply select the type of meat, cut, and cook you want in the MEATER® app, then sit back and relax as perfect results are achieved.\n\n* For veteran chefs, fully customizable cooking and alert options are available to give you total control over your cooking experience.\n\n* Access your complete cooking history with ‘Previous Cooks’ so you can repeat your favorites whenever you want.\n\nCook smarter with MEATER®! Learn more at https://meater.com.\n\nGet to know us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MEATERmade/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/meatermade/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MEATER/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MEATERmade\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@meatermade\n\nCheck out meals cooked with MEATER® by searching the hashtag #meatermade, and don't forget to use the hashtag when you share your own cooks online!\n\nThis app requires at least one MEATER® probe to operate (sold separately at https://meater.com/shop). The MEATER® app supports all iOS devices with Bluetooth® LE (Bluetooth® Smart) support, running iOS 12.2 or later."

Hundreds of mouth-watering recipes included—steaks, burgers, brisket, ribs, fish, whole chicken, and more—with step-by-step grilling instructions, technique videos, how-tos, tips, and a handy timer. Register your grill and kick-start your warranty in the Weber Grills App, too. With assembly instructions, warranty information, and helpful videos, you can manage your Weber grills from the palm of your hand.\n____________\n \nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n \nWEBER ID and REGISTRATION\nSign up (it's so easy) and get your own Weber ID (or log in with your existing ID), and then register your grill(s) to get added benefits. You'll be able to access your warranty, manual, schematic, and helpful videos that include how to set up your grill, how to attach the fuel tank, how to clean your cooking grates ... pretty much everything you need to get started and keep going.\n \nRECIPES \nWith more than 400+ original recipes, you’ll never suffer from an empty grill. Each recipe includes a full-color photo, grill setup guide, grocery list, and the ability to save to your favorites and keep notes. Most recipes have relevant grill skill tips and timers, too, and some recipes even include step-by-step videos. Best of all, each month the app will be updated with a recipe enhanced with a step-by-step video to walk you through the recipe for grilling success. \n \nRECIPE COLLECTIONS\nLove burgers? You'll find a collection of our favorites. How about steak and ribs? Yes and yes? We've put these and several more collections together for you, including healthy recipes, smoking-on-a-plank recipes, rotisserie recipes, and more. \n \nGRILL GUIDES & TIMER\nWhen it comes to cooking times, you’ll never have to wing it again. Grill guides give you cooking times and direct or indirect instruction for almost anything you can put on the grill—meat and veggie alike. And once you've determined your cooking time, set the timer so that everything comes off the grill without a hitch.\n \nGRILL SKILLS \nLearn essential grilling techniques for mastering favorites such as steak, ribs, salmon, and turkey with short instructional videos. From the basics to expert grilling tips, you’ll take your grill skills to the next level.\n \nGROCERY LISTS \nTap on the \"Add to Grocery List\" tab within each recipe and all the ingredients you need will be added to your Grocery List, even for multiple recipes. How great is that?\n \nSEARCH\nFind whatever you’re looking for using the app-wide search functionality."

Each day the eateries who have partnered with Foodprint upload surplus food items that will otherwise be thrown out.  The food is still completely fine to eat and of the same quality as if you’d purchased directly from the store itself.  In just a few clicks, you can search for and purchase food items while exploring local eateries and rescuing food from being sent to landfill.\n\nIn Foodprint you can:\n- Discover food available using the interactive map or list view\n- Order and pay for your food\n- Follow your favourite eateries to receive notifications when they have food available\n- Filter your search based on your location and dietary requirements\n- Search specific food items to satisfy your cravings\n- Leave a review of your experience for the eatery to see\n- See all previous orders\n- Invite your friends to join you in rescuing food\n- Track how much money you saved\n- Track how much carbon you’ve saved\n- Securely store your credit card for easy purchasing\n\nWhy is food waste an issue?\nHumans overproduce food so much, that we end up throwing ⅓ of it away.  This is a huge waste of not only the food but also the resources that went into creating that food such as the land, water, labour and money.  What’s worse, is that when food is sent to landfill it decomposes and emits the greenhouse gas methane, which is a huge contributor to climate change. \n\nIn New Zealand, cafes, restaurants and supermarkets produce 50,000 tonnes of food waste annually. Over 60% of this waste is preventable as the food is still fit for human consumption.  Foodprint provides a practical easy-to-use solution that is appealing to users and eateries, allowing both to reduce their foodprint. \n\nTogether, the Foodprint community rescues food, saves money and helps the environment."

      "label": "CAUTION: CONTAINS WEIRD & WILD FLAVORS\n\nThere is a new way to take the BeanBoozled Challenge. This app lets users play the game (remotely and in person), capture photos, find retailers and order online. \n\nBeanBoozled is a game of risk with two different challenging ways to play. Are you brave enough? \n\nThe original BeanBoozled:  Ten delicious Jelly Belly jelly bean flavors (like Juicy Pear or Pomegranate) have been paired up with ten lookalikes in weird and wild flavors (like Booger or Old Bandage). Will it be Buttered Popcorn or Rotten Egg? Peach or Barf? There’s only one way to find out! \n\nThe BeanBoozled Fiery Five Challenge asks how hot can you handle? Five progressively hot jelly beans range from smoldering Sriracha to scorching Carolina Reaper. Can you handle the heat?\n\nWhat is the BeanBoozled App?\n• Take the game anywhere! Take turns spinning the BeanBoozled wheel in the app to see what flavor you’ll have to try next.\n• The app comes with a video sharing function so you can challenge your friends – wherever they are – in real time. You don’t need to physically be together to play BeanBoozled! Just use the built-in “Challenge A Friend” feature to play with your friend remotely. The app will send an invitation to your friend to play, and once they accept, you’re sharing the same spinner and playing the game together.\n• Take photos while you play in the “Challenge A Friend” mode, or 6-second GIFs of the crazy faces your friends make. Add photo frames and share them to your social media channels.\n• When you run out of a flavor, simply tell the app and the spinner will continue play without landing on what you’re missing.\n• Need more BeanBoozled jelly beans? Search for a store near you with our built-in Store Locator, or use the option to buy online.\n• Not sure what the jelly bean flavors are? Consult the handy flavor menu in the app for a helpful guide.\n\nA Few Tips…\n• DO have a trash can handy at all times. Trust us – you’ll need it.\n• If you're playing BeanBoozled Fiery Five, have some milk, ice cream, rice or honey handy to extinguish the burn.\n• DO NOT let wimps or crybabies play this game. (OK- maybe let them play after all. It can be fun to watch!)\n• DO Make up your own rules. This is BeanBoozled where anything goes! Your imagination is your only limit.\n\nPlaying with your food has never been this much fun!"

      "label": "Found a recipe on the internet that looks great? Yum! Add it to Whisk and start creating your personal cookbook. Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com. We want to make sure your Whisk experience is the best it can be!"

      "label": "WHAT IS MIXOLOGY?\n\nWe define the art of Mixology as the study or skill of inventing, preparing, and serving mixed drinks, or cocktails. All mixologists are bartenders, but not all bartenders are mixologists. In our eyes, a Mixologist is someone who has a passion for the art of drink making, and therefore strives to learn not just how each individual cocktail, or mocktail, is made but also why it is made in that way, garnished with this particular commodity, and mixed using this technique rather than another. A mixologist will be no stranger to a wide range of cocktail accessories necessary to ply his or her trade.\n\nHOW TO BECOME A MIXOLOGIST ?\n\nThe beauty of Mixology lies in the fact almost anyone can become a Mixologist at any time, so long as they are dedicated to mastering the skill and studying the art of mixing different tastes and flavors to make a classic cocktail or perhaps even a brand new drink altogether!\n\nPERFECT YOUR SIGNATURE DRINK \n\nThis is the year you should create a signature drink that’s unique to you. It should be something that looks and tastes nice and a drink that not every bartender can easily make. It should also sound appealing so that it doesn’t get lost in the menu and customers order it.\n\nThe trick is to choose something out of the ordinary. It should require a technique that you’ve worked on, lots of practice to get it right and something your team turns to you for when guests order it.\n\nEither stick with something gin-based like a Martini or something which can evoke happy memories, like a Mojito.\n\nLEARN AND ADOPT NEW TRENDS\n\nstay ahead of the game and adopt these new trends in your own bar. It can be new skills, techniques and flavor combinations which customers are going to like. It’s better to be prepared for these new trends right now rather than catching up when it’s too late. Using new trends and flavor combinations can encourage repeat visitors, especially if you do it before anyone else.\n\n\nSTARTING FROM NOW...\n\nMixology Bartender Recipe App will save Thousands of people Thousands of dollars by mixing their own drinks. But, This Mixology Bartender Recipe App offers even more... \n\nHow much is inspiration worth to you?\n\nYes. You heard it right.

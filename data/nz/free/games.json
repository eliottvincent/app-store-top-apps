Play online with 4-15 players as you attempt to prep your spaceship for departure, but beware as one or more random players among the Crew are Impostors bent on killing everyone.\n\nMASTER YOUR SOCIAL DEDUCTION SKILLS.\nCrewmates win by completing all tasks or discovering and voting the Impostors off the ship. The Impostor can use sabotage to cause chaos, making for easier kills and better alibis. Optional roles create a whole new level of gameplay. Try out the Scientist, Engineer, Guardian Angel, or Shapeshifter to create chaos! Think you’re a master of deception? Only one way to find out!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR GAME.\nChoose how you want to play! Change the number of Impostors, roles, tasks, player visibility, and more. Play in style as you change your Crewmates’ color, visor, nameplate, outfit, and hat. More customization options are planned to be continually added in.\n\nPLAY WITH ANYONE.\nCross-platform play is supported. Play with friends (or enemies?) between PC, mobile, or console!\n\nIf you have any issues, visit us at: https://www.innersloth.com/faq/"

Anemo, Electro, Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, Dendro, and Geo interact in all sorts of ways, and Vision wielders have the power to turn this to their advantage.\n\nWill you vaporize Hydro with Pyro, electro-charge it with Electro, or freeze it with Cryo? Your mastery of the elements will give you the upper hand in battle and exploration.\n\nBEAUTIFUL VISUALS\n\nFeast your eyes on the world around you, with a stunning art style, real-time rendering, and finely tuned character animations delivering you a truly immersive visual experience. Lighting and weather all change naturally over time, bringing every detail of this world to life.\n\nSOOTHING SOUNDTRACK\n\nLet the beautiful sounds of Teyvat draw you in as you explore the expansive world around you. Performed by the world's top orchestras such as London Philharmonic Orchestra and Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the soundtrack changes seamlessly with the time and gameplay to match the mood.\n\nBUILD YOUR DREAM TEAM\n\nTeam up with a diverse cast of characters in Teyvat, each with their own unique personalities, stories, and abilities. Discover your favorite party combinations and level up your characters to help you conquer even the most daunting of enemies and domains.\n\nJOURNEY WITH FRIENDS\n\nTeam up with friends across various platforms to trigger more elemental action, tackle tricky boss fights, and conquer challenging domains together to reap rich rewards.\n\nAs you stand atop the peaks of Jueyun Karst and take in the rolling clouds and vast terrain stretching out before you, you may wish to stay in Teyvat a little longer... But until you are reunited with your lost sibling, how can you rest?

Your ball shatters to pieces and you have to start your fall all over again.\n\nBut even black platforms are no match for a fireball falling at full speed! Choose your strategy: speed up like a madman or stop and wait for your next chance to roll and jump.

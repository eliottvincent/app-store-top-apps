Play online with 4-15 players as you attempt to prep your spaceship for departure, but beware as one or more random players among the Crew are Impostors bent on killing everyone.\n\nMASTER YOUR SOCIAL DEDUCTION SKILLS.\nCrewmates win by completing all tasks or discovering and voting the Impostors off the ship. The Impostor can use sabotage to cause chaos, making for easier kills and better alibis. Optional roles create a whole new level of gameplay. Try out the Scientist, Engineer, Guardian Angel, or Shapeshifter to create chaos! Think you’re a master of deception? Only one way to find out!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR GAME.\nChoose how you want to play! Change the number of Impostors, roles, tasks, player visibility, and more. Play in style as you change your Crewmates’ color, visor, nameplate, outfit, and hat. More customization options are planned to be continually added in.\n\nPLAY WITH ANYONE.\nCross-platform play is supported. Play with friends (or enemies?) between PC, mobile, or console!\n\nIf you have any issues, visit us at: https://www.innersloth.com/faq/"

Formulate your favorite team combination to help you conquer even the most daunting of situations. \n\n【VENTURE INTO THE WILD】 \nJourney outside the shelter and scavenge for valuable resources in the wastelands. \nSet up camps to act as forward operating bases and resource points. But be on guard! Zombies could attack at any moment! \n\n【ESTABLISH ALLIANCES WITH FRIENDS】 \nFighting alone is hard, so why not fight alongside friends?

But then pins are in the way! Can you help out and flip away the pins and get the balls to where they are supposed to be?\n\nBut wait: there is another level of trickery! Sometimes some of the balls are colourless: before they go into the pipe, they need to touch a color ball, so the color spreads to them as well. So simple yet so tricky!"

Start from the ground up in this fun and fast-paced time-management game where the aim is to build an accommodation empire and demonstrate your dedication to hospitality. Show your skills as a hotel manager, invest wisely in staff and property improvements, and work your socks off to become a hospitality tycoon in this addictive and entertaining casual simulator.\n\n► FIRST-CLASS SERVICE\n\n• Climb to the top: Start the game as a simple bellhop single-handedly cleaning rooms, greeting guests at reception, collecting payments and tips, and keeping the bathroom stocked with toilet paper. As your bank balance expands, upgrade rooms and facilities, and employ new staff to help keep up with the growing demand at your hotel. Your guests may be sleeping comfortably, but there’s no time to rest for a determined hotel tycoon.\n\n• Build an empire: There are several hotels to explore and expand, each with dozens of different unique upgrades to make before you reach five-star perfection. Demonstrate your competence as a manager in each location, then get promoted to get a new and bigger property, and continue your path to becoming a true hotel tycoon. Each hotel has its own style and atmosphere too.\n\n• Keep going: If you want success in this high-stakes industry, you can’t just stroll around your property at a leisurely pace.

Bathrooms are the first step, but work hard and you’ll soon have the opportunity to add vending machines, restaurants, parking lots, and swimming pools to your properties. Guests will pay extra for each facility, boosting your revenue. Though remember each facility also needs staffing, so get hiring or you’ll soon run off your feet with angry guests left standing in line for each amenity.\n\n• Grand designs: Upgrade accommodation to improve guests’ experience of your property and choose from a range of different room designs in each location. In this engaging simulator, you’re not just a manager, you’re an interior designer too!\n\n► FIVE-STAR FUN\n\nLooking for a time-management game that’s original and simple to play and provides endless hours of entertainment?

All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

The program will automatically position the sketch on the canvas, while giving you the opportunity to change the image parameters.

Provide an image and a prompt, and the AI will produce art based on your interpretation of the image. For instance, if you upload a drawing of someone's face, an image with that face's composition will be generated.\n \nLet's have fun using AI to create art!\n\nMake stunning artwork with the help of AI! Enter a prompt, select an aesthetic, and watch as Muse quickly transforms your concept into an AI-powered painting.\nThen how does Muse operate?\nWhatever you want to make, just type it in! — Countless paintings might be created, like \"Alien Space Station,\" \"City Sunset,\" \"Rainbow Forest,\" and whatever else you can think of. Let your imagination run wild!\nPick an artistic idiom!

All you need to do is enter a prompt, pick an art style - and watch Wonder bring your idea to life in seconds!\n\nIt’s super simple: Simply describe what you want Muse to paint — such as “Life Under Sea” or “Shattered Rainbow” — pick a style (Cubist, Dali, Synthwave, Steampunk, etc.), or select “no style”; and hit create!\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.useelio.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of Use: https://www.useelio.com/terms-o"

No problem!\n\nThe app works similar to the original Da Vinci Eye app, and comes with the same great drawing tools, but has one huge difference: the Mural Maker uses TWO iOS devices to virtually project onto walls, large canvases, and tabletops.\n\nThe first device acts as video camera live-streaming your canvas. The second device, goes in your hand and displays the live feed. The app then puts a transparent image you want to draw on top of the feed.\n\nUnlike a projector, Mural Maker lets you accurately compare colors and shades on on your canvas to the reference image as well as letting you trace outlines!\n\n- Works outdoors\n- Works in the daylight\n- Make HUGE or small artwork\n- Record a time-lapse of your work\n- Same great Da Vinci Eye Tools (Breakdown / Strobe / filters)"

      "label": "In art, a value (or tone) is how light or dark a colour is. If you're learning to paint or draw, a good place to start is by doing value studies. These are small loose sketches in greyscale that show where shadows fall and highlights appear. These are particularly useful when the subject is more complicated, when it's hard to see through the colours to show the subtle shadows.  \n\nIf you're learning to paint or draw, value studies are a sure-fire way to improve both your artwork and how you visualise references in your mind. People often use photo editors to convert a colour photo to black and white... this is helpful but this app goes further.\n\nBy using Value Study, you're able to flick between levels of detail. Maybe you want to start with just black and white to get a base down, then add in extra values one by one to build up your understanding of the reference you are studying.\n\nYou can even take it a step further and select all areas that have a matching tone. Click one of the values along the bottom in the greyscale palette to see all areas that match it in the image, so you can focus in on one value while painting it. For example in a portrait, this could mean seeing how different parts of the body have the same amount of shadow despite potentially looking wildly different when viewed in colour.\n\nValue Study is a tool, not to replace your own value studies but to enhance them and especially to help beginner artists have some idea how where to start when looking at complicated reference imagery."

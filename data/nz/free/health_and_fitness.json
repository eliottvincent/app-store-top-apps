      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Here are some of the features of the application:\n\n- Your closet: If you want to understand the products composition that compose your bathroom cupboards, you just have to scan them and then save them in your closet. You can do as many as you want! This will then allow you to have statistics in order to know your consumption of harmful ingredients, follow your progress more easily and tend towards a cleaner, greener consumption, for your body heath and for our planet\n\n- A virtual beauty box: You will regularly discover, in this box, cosmetics from responsible brands that offer cleaner products that are better for your body health and for our planet. All the compositions are decrypted even in this box\n\n- A scanner to allow you to scan your cosmetic products in order to know everything about them, to know their origin: The composition, the dangerousness of the ingredients for your body health and for our planet, their origin, their function, their frequency of use. I'm also trying to teach you a little more about the composition to know how to decrypt them more easily, to act cleaner. And if you don't have the product to scan it, you can always search manually and have access to its composition.\n\n- A history: You will find there all the scans that you have done or the products that you have consulted. If you have a crush on a cleaner product just add it to favorites.\n\n- Access to all features anonymously: No account needed! And thanks to a QRcode you will always have access to your favorite products, your history, your box, your closets.\n\nAt Savonnette we want to support you towards more responsible consumption: consumption that allows you to pay attention to the health of your body but also to the health of the planet.

Wondering if that viral serum will work for your skin? With the OnSkin app, your skin always gets what it needs! \n\nINGREDIENT SCANNER AT HAND\n> Understanding what’s inside all those alluring bottles is the key to choosing an effective product. With OnSkin, you’ll easily narrow down what works for you. Scan the barcode on the package, and OnSkin will decode the ingredients, giving you basic information about each component and its function. Beautiful packages with frenchy names will no longer fool you!\n\nSUGGESTED OPTIONS\n> Your skin is unique and should be treated accordingly—that's why it's important to know what touches it. OnSkin provides you with safer alternatives to products with questionable ingredients. With our app, it’s easy to be your skin’s best friend and keep it healthy and radiant every day. \n\nPRODUCT RATINGS\n> Join a community of skincare enthusiasts from all over the world to find honest ratings and self-care inspiration, reassessing your beauty product collection. The OnSkin approach to beauty is not skin-deep—we shorten the journey to finding your next favorite product. Instead of buying another bottle with ingredients that are useless at best and harmful at worst, opt for conscious shopping. Learn all about a product’s ingredients before you add it to your beauty arsenal.\n\nYOUR OWN PRODUCT DATABASE\n> If you’re fond of hunting for new products, become a beauty contributor for OnSkin and add the products that are not yet in our database. In exchange, you’ll get a complete analysis of the products—a win-win for you and your skin. \n\nSCAN HISTORY \n>  With the scan history feature, you'll have a collection of the products you've come across in the store. Have a vague memory of an SPF you saw in Sephora last month? It’s already saved in your scan history.\n\nBy using the app, you are agreeing to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use:\nhttps://aiby.mobi/cosmetic/terms/\nhttps://aiby.mobi/cosmetic/privacy/"

      "label": "It’s time to get off the dieting seesaw. With Zero, tap into the power of intermittent fasting and other healthy habits to lose weight and build momentum on your journey toward living longer, better.  \n\nWE’RE #1 FOR A REASON.\n\nZero Members have lost millions of pounds — and that’s no accident. Featured in Good Housekeeping, Men’s Health, Fortune, Techcrunch, Women’s Health, The Tim Ferriss Show, and more, Zero is the world’s most popular fasting app. We help you leverage the science of health in simple ways you can practice daily to build habits that last a lifetime.\n\nRooted in scientific research and supported by Zero’s world-class Scientific Advisory Board — led by Dr. Peter Attia — Zero helps you stack healthy habits to make big changes. You’ll start with one simple habit, like fasting, and build incrementally to improve your exercise, sleep, and more. Get ready to meet a healthier you.\n\nSTART WITH JUST ONE TAP\n\nThe world's most popular Fasting Timer helps you track your fasts, your progress, and your goals. Start your Timer and stay on target with all popular fasting types, including: \n\n• 13-HOUR FAST, based on research by Dr. Satchin Panda (Salk Institute), this 13-hour or “circadian rhythm fast” aligns your eating window with your body’s clock.\n\n• 16-HOUR FAST, or the 16:8 intermittent fast, used by celebrities, athletes, and millions of Zero Members to manage weight and improve metabolic wellbeing.\n\n• 18-HOUR FAST, or 18:6, for more advanced fasters.\n\n• Other popular fasts include OMAD (one meal a day), the 20:4 fast, and custom prolonged fasts up to 7 days.\n\nGET PERSONAL\n\nZero’s real-time tips, individualized stats, and Personalized Fasting Zones have helped millions of Members form new habits and achieve their weight-loss and health-gain goals. Discover insights into the changes your body is experiencing and get guidance and accountability along the way.\n\nGO BEYOND FASTING\n\nFasting is a great starting point for living a longer, healthier life. But if you’re committed to losing weight, gaining health, and boosting longevity, you’ll need to look to the Four Pillars of Health: Nutrition, Activity, Sleep, and Restoration. Zero’s innovative yet simple features help you build lifelong habits across these Four Pillars for accelerated progress and transformative change.\n\nSEE THE FULL PICTURE\n\nThe Loop helps you visualize your journey and celebrate wins across the Four Pillars of Health. As you log or sync your data, you’ll see the corresponding color for each Pillar added to the Loop. Watch as your smart choices add up over days, weeks, months, and years.\n\nBUILD CONSISTENCY\n\nBuild actionable, data-driven habits with the Habit Tracker. Build consistency by logging your meals, workouts, and more. If you’re using an Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura Ring, or other apps and wearables, you can sync them with Zero to make this a completely automated experience.\n\nMAINTAIN MOMENTUM\n\nStay focused with expert-led, science-backed content, community Challenges, achievements, and more. Zero is your partner for building healthy habits that propel you towards better, lasting health.\n\nDownload the Zero app to get started for free, or unlock premium features with Zero Plus.\n\nPayment for Zero Plus will be charged to your iTunes Account when you subscribe.

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

Scan the official QR codes wherever you see them and add manual entries for your visits to other places. \n\nUse Bluetooth Tracing to enable the Exposure Notification System on your phone, so people around you can be anonymously notified if they are exposed to COVID-19.  \n\nSign up for contact alerts in case you’ve checked into a location at the same time as someone with COVID-19, or exchanged anonymous Bluetooth keys with someone with COVID-19. \n\nIf you’re found to have COVID-19, you can share your digital diary with contact tracers. This will help us identify whether any of your friends, whānau or community members may have also been exposed, so we can respond quickly and stop any further spread of the virus in New Zealand. \n\n\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, you can also upload your anonymous Bluetooth Tracing keys so that other app users who have been close to you will be quickly notified. This helps to keep your friends, whanau and community safe without compromising on your privacy.   \n\nRegister your contact information so contact tracers can get in touch if they need to.  \n\nThe Ministry of Health has worked closely with the Privacy Commissioner and independent security experts during the development of NZ COVID Tracer to ensure your privacy and data security are protected.  \n\nYour digital diary will be stored securely on your phone and deleted automatically after 60 days. Any personal information you choose to share with contact tracers will be used only for public health purposes and never for enforcement.  \n\nInformation about who you have encountered using Bluetooth Tracing will never leave your phone and is automatically deleted after 14 days. \n\nVisit www.health.govt.nz/NZ-COVID-Tracer for further information."

A private members-only social community, 24/7 live coach chat, 5-Minute Coaching audios—we've got it all. \n\n\nMotivation to get moving. More activity means more weight loss. Ease into exercise with fun on-demand classes from obé Fitness and simple ways to move more (housework counts!). Plus, you can sync your fitness tracker and Apple Health. \n\n\nBetter sleep. Science shows people who get consistently less sleep are hungrier throughout the day. Learn to get better shut-eye, track your sleep, relax with Breethe meditations, and get 5-Minute Coaching audios to help you de-stress.  \n\n\nGet the results you want with easy-to-use features on your mobile phone.\n- Customized food plan and Points Budget \n- Food, activity, water, sleep, and weight trackers\n- Barcode scanner for packaged foods, recipe database, and restaurant finder\n- Meditations and all-level workouts\n- Progress reports\n- 24/7 live coach chat\n- 12,000+ recipes \n- Blood sugar tracker (with the WeightWatchers Diabetes-Tailored Plan)\n\nDownload the WW app now and get a free trial today!

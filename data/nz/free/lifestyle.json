      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only."

      "label": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app.\n\nAlong with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.\n\nThrough our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.\n\n**The I Am Sober app features:**\n\n• Sober day tracker\nTo visualize how long you’ve been sober.\n\n• Remember why you quit\nAdd reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.\n\n• Daily pledge tracker\nTake a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

You can now use this app to control your Philips Hue smart Bluetooth lights!*  \n\nOrganize your smart lights your way \nWhether you use just a few bulbs or have completely outfitted your home in Philips Hue, you can organize your smart lights with ease. Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

From the virtual Layout Assistant, to one-touch RGB presets, to full in-depth customization like you’ve never seen before, prepare for a lighting experience that is Smarter by Design. \n\nSimple Control\nUse the App to scan your lights’ pairing code and get set up in seconds, then enjoy your smart light-switch. Remotely turn your lights on and off, adjust brightness (trust us they go BRIGHT), and select your color Scenes from anywhere within your home. Group your lights together for joint control with Group Scenes (because we love a team player), or segment by room to keep your lights as organized as you wish your life could be.\n\nComplete Customization\nCreate custom dynamic Scenes by selecting palettes and colors with the intuitive color wheel, adjusting ratios, and choosing animated motions. Try vibrant RGB hues to set a total vibe, or put the “fun” in functional lighting with the whole range of white color temperatures.\n\nAdvanced Automations\nSet Schedules to automate your daily lighting needs, from gentle morning light-alarms, to gradually dimming nightly reminders that Holy **** it’s 2AM again, you need to wake up in 4 hours, PLEASE go to sleep. \n\nNow You’re Talking\nConnect your lights with your smart home assistant (HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Samsung SmartThings) and use voice commands to control them hands-free. Just say “Hey Siri, turn on my “TGIF” Scene” and instantly enter full relaxation-mode at the end of a long week. The best part of all, you don’t even have to say “Please”... but it’d still be nice if you did though :)\n\nJoin the Community\nExplore the App’s “Discover” tab for a huge collection of incredible Scenes created by users like you. Well, like you, just more creative. But if you too are the creative type, share your own Scenes and show the community what you’ve got! There are endless Scenes to discover for every mood and occasion, all the way from “Ho Ho Holidays” to “Netflix and Chill”.\n\n+ More\nWith a virtual AR Layout Assistant, curated Scenes and Playlists, Cloud Control (requires Apple home hub), and additional product information, the Nanoleaf App really is your smart lighting one-stop-shop.\n\n\nThe Nanoleaf App supports Nanoleaf Light Panels, Canvas, Shapes, Essentials, Elements, and Lines. \n\nEnjoy it today on the ever superior iOS operating system."

      "label": "Get projects done right the first time with easy-to-follow BILT instructions.\n\n\nFEATURES\n- Follow interactive 3D animation on each step\n- Zoom in and out\n- Rotate 3D images for a better angle\n- Tap on any part for details\n- Choose optional voice narration & text guides\n- Skip ahead, go back, or replay a step instantly\n- Be confident with official, up-to-date, brand-approved guides\n- Download instructions ahead to use without WiFi\n\n\n\nBENEFITS\n- Easier to understand than paper or video\n- Reduces paper waste\n- Confidence you did it right the first time\n\nWhether it’s for assembly, installation, maintenance, or repair, BILT instructions are a revolutionary new way to set up products efficiently.\n\n\n\nWHY IS BILT FREE?\nIt’s true — BILT is free to everyone! And unlike instructions online, BILT doesn’t allow ads or annoying pop-ups. The platform is paid for by hundreds of leading brands that believe you deserve a better experience with their products. These participating brands provide 3D instructions as a service because BILT users are happier with their purchases and have fewer returns. It’s a win-win!\n\n\n\nNO SIGN IN!\nYou do not need to provide any personal information or create an account to use BILT. We’re serious about making it easy.\n\nBut there are benefits to creating a BILT account: \n- Save your receipt\n- Register a product\n- Access warranty information\n- Keep downloaded instructions in “My Stuff” to access later\n- Leave a rating & review to help your favorite brands improve their products over time\n\n\n\nAWARDS\n- Most Innovative Construction Tool, National Association of Home Builders\n- Gold Winner, User Experience Awards\n- Winner, Pro Tool Innovation Awards\n\n\n\nBILT TOOLBOX\nThe BILT Toolbox is a collection of instructions to help you with home, auto, and safety projects, as well as guides for basic power tools. Follow easy BILT instructions to fix a toilet, lay bathroom tile, paint a room, jump a car battery, change a tire, use a circular saw, adjust a bicycle, repair drywall, and so much more to help with anything adulthood sends your way.\n\nWe use the BILT Toolbox too, so if we have a question about something, we design an instruction for it. We welcome your suggestions, too. From personal experience we recommend downloading “How to Jump a Car Battery” before you need it because internet connections at soccer fields can be spotty. :)\n\n\n\nDATA PRIVACY\nWe do not collect personal data other than what you choose to provide if you create an account, register a product, or leave a review. \n\nWe do collect aggregate data such as the number of downloads for each product and the average time it takes to complete an instruction step, but it cannot be tied to an individual user.\n\n\n\nFEEDBACK FROM OUR USERS\n- “I really like putting things together, but the BILT app made it a breeze! A fun little activity and a great outcome. I’m a visual learner so I really appreciate a 3D option with parts clearly labeled!! I could build a million things with the help of this app particularly. Highly recommend!!!”\n\n- \"I'm telling you, I could easily engineer a space craft if they had the directions on BILT.\"\n\n- \"I usually shy away from putting stuff together but this helped me a lot. I’m proud of myself.”\n\n- “Made it very easy, I didn’t cuss or throw anything.”\n\n- “My husband & I are NOT handy people. However, with the BILT app we were able to correctly put together a grill in a couple hours with NO arguments! LOL! This app may have saved our marriage. I highly recommend this app.”\n\n- \"Extremely easy and very convenient. Thank you for making my life a little bit easier.\"\n\n- “For someone who is an auditory learner, this is great. Thanks. Love that I can review assembly instructions even before it ships and then use the app once things are unpacked. Plus, it will always be there should I ever need it again. Just brilliant!”\n\n\n\nDo it right the first time and download BILT now!"

It’s property on the go.\n \nSearch thousands of properties\nWith new listings every day, we make it easy for you to find the right property. Whether you’re searching for a house, apartment, off-the-plan property or house and land package - you can filter down to the exact real estate you’re looking for. Search by suburb, address, school name or on the map. Then, set your filters including price, property type, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, land size or use keywords like ‘pool’. \n \nSee properties before other buyers\nKnow what you’re looking for? Turn on property alerts to be notified about properties that match your search. Whether you’re looking for a rental property or a home for sale, notifications help you find the right property sooner. In NSW, VIC or QLD? Now you can get alerts about off-market properties on Domain! Just create a property alert and we'll let you know about off-market properties that tick those boxes before they're even listed. Coming soon for the rest of Australia, so stay tuned!\n \nDraw your search\nWith map search, we make it easy to search for a property in your favourite area. Map view lets you use your fingertip to circle the area where you’d like to find a property. You can then switch to list view to see all available properties for rent or sale in that area neatly laid out.\n \nShortlist with someone\nProperty hunting with someone? Whether you’re buying a house with your partner, renting an apartment with your best friend or value the opinion of a trusted real estate advisor or  - you can invite anyone to shortlist with you. That way, both of your favourite properties are in one place. You’ll never have to share a link again.\n \nPlan your inspections \nWhen you shortlist your favourite properties, we add them to your inspection planner so you know what time and where you need to be for your open inspections or auctions. You can switch to map view to understand where the properties are located in relation to each other and your current location. You can also keep track of what you thought by rating each property after you inspect it. It’s never been easier to organise your favourite properties.\n \nFollow your home’s value\nFollow your home on Domain for Owners to see what your next move should be. There, you’ll be able to research the market relevant to your home or rental property. We provide information about the estimated value, current demand and local area activity (such as properties that have recently sold) all at a glance. \n \nFind the right agent\nWe have all the tools to help you find your local real estate agent, get a free property appraisal, review auction results or organise your home loan.\n \nHave a suggestion?\nWe’re committed to making your next property move as easy as possible. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please email us at feedback@domain.com.au.\n \nPlease note: This app features Nielsen's proprietary measurement software which will allow you to contribute to research or audience ratings services.

      "label": "Over 40 million families around the world have chosen AlfredCamera to secure their home. We are the world's most popular and top-rated app for home security.\n\n\nSECURITY CAMERA FOR THE SMARTPHONE AGE \n\nPeople love Alfred Camera! The all-in-one app provides more features than a basic, expensive security camera. You can get live stream, instant intruder alert, walkie-talkie, and unlimited cloud storage to store, share, and playback your video footage.\n\n\nFREE, STABLE, RELIABLE\n\nIf you want a CCTV to keep an eye on your belongings, a baby monitor to look after your newborn, or a pet cam to entertain your lovely pets, Alfred Camera is the best choice!\n\n\nSUPER EASY TO SET UP\n\nDIY your own home security camera in 3 minutes. No cost, no hard skills; just one creative idea! Alfred Camera is the easiest-to-install home surveillance system with professional-grade features, period.\n\n\nANYTIME, ANYWHERE\n\nUnlike traditional CCTV cameras or home surveillance cameras, you can put Alfred wherever you need to strengthen security. It works like a portable video monitor, so you don’t even need a security guard! After all, if anything like theft or breaking in happens, the video footage will be extremely helpful.\n\n\nSIMPLE SECURITY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nWith crystal clear live stream, you'll always know exactly what's going on. Additionally, Alfred's motion sensor will send you an instant alert when it finds an intruder. You can scare the intruder away by the walkie-talkie immediately. The auto-recorded videos will be kept in free, unlimited cloud storage. You can use them as evidence to help identify the suspect. \n\n\nFEATURES\n\nAlfred Camera has all of the standard features of a home security camera, along with the following:\n\n• 24/7 LIVE STREAM: Watch the high-quality live video from anywhere.\n• SMART INTRUDER ALERT: Get instant alert when the camera picks up any movement.\n• UNLIMITED CLOUD STORAGE: Playback, download, and share your video footage at any time. \n• LOW-LIGHT FILTER: Reinforce security when it's dark.\n• WALKIE-TALKIE: Deter thieves, interact with visitors or pets, and soothe babies.\n• 360 CAMERA: Cover a larger area with both lenses.\n• ZOOM, SCHEDULE, REMINDER, TRUST CIRCLE, SIREN and more...\n\nA housekeeper you can really trust!

You can protect your home with a smarter solution. Here's a tip: You might not even need to buy a real CCTV camera, baby monitor, IP cam or IP webcam. \n\nBesides the cost of the equipment, these smart home appliances often charge a monthly fee. With security apps like Alfred, there is no complicated installation, IP settings, or contract. You only have to download Alfred to repurpose your old devices as a DIY WiFi Camera or baby monitor: pure and simple. \n\nThe best home surveillance camera you can ever find: Free, reliable, versatile and easy to use. No hidden upfront costs or astronomical monitoring fees. Alfred is also an essential component of any home improvement or home automation project if you are interested in building a smart home or experimenting with Google Assistant. \n\nEveryone is taking advantage of their unused smartphones by turning them into video players, GPS navigators, or fitness devices. So why not use yours as a baby cam, nanny cam, pet cam, webcam or IP cam?\n\n\nAlfred Premium, a subscription service, charges 3.99 USD/month. It offers HD viewing, recording, as well as ad removal. At the confirmation of upgrade, the payment will be charged to your iTunes Account. The account will be automatically charged for renewal unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the current subscription expires. You can manage your subscription and auto-renewal by going to Account Settings.\n\nTerms of Service:\nhttps://alfred.camera/legal/terms-of-service"

When set to smart watering mode, B-hyve takes the guesswork out of watering and utilizes Mother Nature, along with some really great technology, to determine the watering schedule for your yard.  When set and left in smart watering mode, B-hyve can save users as much as 50% more water over a traditional controller. \n\nWeather\nWhen set in smart mode, B-hyve uses local weather data to determine how much water is evaporated and transpired through your plants each day to know when it needs to water.  It also accounts for any rainfall that is in the forecast, shuts off the system for rain, then looks back to see how much actually fell.  That’s smart!  But all yards are not the same.  B-hyve also takes into account things like soil type, plant type, sun/shade and slope to determine a watering schedule that takes the water to the roots and helps avoid runoff. \n\nWeatherSense\nIf you want to be the one in control of the schedule, that’s okay too.  With B-hyve you can set custom programs to water how you want while still taking advantage of the local weather data to override watering in case of a weather event.  This will shut off your system during the rain and resume your program when the rain has passed.  That’s smart!\n\nIntegrated Irrigation Audit Tool\nThe B-hyve app also integrates the award-winning irrigation audit tool right to your smart device.  By performing a catch cup test on your sprinkler system, you will know exactly how much water is being applied rather than relying on estimated sprinkler head water use that other timers/apps use, which can be off by as much as 50%, saving you more water and money.   \n\nThis is the app for the best-selling, WaterSense and SWAT certified Orbit B-hyve Smart Wifi Sprinkler Timer.  This is also the companion app for homeowners with the Hydro-Rain B-hyve Pro Wifi Controller. \nPlease let us know if you have questions or problems.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

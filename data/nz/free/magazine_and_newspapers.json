Oslovuje největší komunitu osobního rozvoje na českém a slovenském internetu. Zakladatelem projektu je Petr Casanova (*1974), který je taktéž zakladatelem podnikatelské akademie First Class Academy, videoprojektu FCTV.cz a seznamovací platformy WithYou.cz. Petr je vedle stránky FirstClass.cz autorem tištěného magazínu FC a čtyřnásobných bestsellerů 250 zákonů lásky a Dvanáct srdcí.\nOd poloviny roku 2017 je součástí aplikace také magazín Business Leaders (www.businessleaders.cz).\n\nJednotlivá čísla FC lze v aplikaci nakupovat buď jednotlivě nebo jako automaticky prodlužované předplatné. Cena FC magazínu je stanovena následujícím způsobem: jedno vydání 4.99 euro, půroční předplatné 19,99 euro a roční předplatné za cenu 37,99 euro. Platba se po odsouhlasení nákupu strhává z iTunes účtu uživatele. Předplatné se po uplynutí automaticky prodlužuje. To může uživatel vypnout nejpozději 24 hodin před jeho vypršením v nastavení iTunes účtu. Platba za další předplacené odbobí je strhávána z iTunes účtu vždy 24 hodin před koncem předchozího období. Už zahájené období předplatného nelze zrušit. Podmínky používání a nakládání s osobními údaji jsou dostupné na https://elektronicky.firstclass.cz/d/obchodni-podminky a také v aplikaci v sekcích Archiv a Předplatné. Pokud se rozhodnete zakoupit předplatné během období, kdy aplikace nabízí obsah zdarma, přicházíte bez náhrady o zbytek tohoto období. Veškeré časy publikování nových čísel jsou vztažené k časové zóně České republiky GMT+1. Pokud nakupujete v jiné časové zóně, prosím počítejte s časovým odstupem."

From politics to culture, current affairs to reviews, a wide range of topics are intelligently commented on daily and in our monthly magazine.\n\nThe Spectator was established in 1828 in Britain. In 2018, after a mere 190 years, we launched our US edition, with the goal of bringing the same insight, original thought and writing to an American audience. \n\nWe hold no party line; our only allegiance is to clarity of thought, elegance of expression and independence of opinion. Our writers opinions range from left to right, their circumstances vary. We do not strive for impartiality — our motto is ‘firm, but unfair’ — but for originality and style.\n\n\"At last Britain’s foremost periodical, first published 1828, brings the English language to America. Here is the native tongue of wit, learning, and sense — wise rather than wised-up, clever but not too clever by half, and humorous in a way that answers to every humor including blood, phlegm, and bile of diverse colors. Civilized reading for barbarous times.\"\n-P.J. O'Rourke on The Spectator \n\n\"You can go to hell—you and your irrelevant rag.\" \n-Sebastian Gorka\n\nFeatures\n-The Spectator's US edition app is free to download.

      "label": "Felt is a warm, soft, tactile fabric. It can be shaped, steamed and easily manipulated to form all sorts of angles and dimensions. It can be thick and insulating as in a warm winter coat, or it can be light and fluid as in a summer Nuno garment.\nTraditional felt has no internal structure. It is not woven or knitted, but is simply a collection of fibres, such as wool, alpaca, rabbit etc, that with the addition of heat, agitation and often water and soap, shrinks to form an interlocked fabric structure. \nNuno felt occurs when wool is worked together with cloth, usually of an open-weave structure, such as muslin, cheesecloth, gauze or light silk. Nuno is often used to laminate or capture objects between layers. Nuno is sometimes referred to as laminated felt. \nFelt magazine examines traditional felt, Nuno felt, embellishing techniques, dry felting (needle felting and machine punching) and knitted (fulled) felt with a comprehensive mix of articles, projects, profiles and visual inspiration. It includes a mix of easy, intermediate and technical projects to suit a wide range of skill levels. \nOpen up a new world of fun, and give Felt a go. We’ll show you how.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a free app download.

Thought-provoking: Present audio articles that inform, inspire, and offer fresh insights, through both a global and a national lens. Focus on opinion, feature, and analysis articles.\n3. Storytellers: Be storytellers and educators. Help our listeners understand global topics, and perspectives, while also telling the stories of the people behind the headlines.\n4.

Our goal is to help listeners navigate it. \n\nAUDIO STORIES\nListening to the best journalism is a great way to learn and grow, especially when you don’t have time to read. Audio articles are produced and recorded daily by Noa’s talented voice actors – Sam Scholl, Adrienne Walker, Peter Hanly, Martin Buchanan, Les Smith, Grainne Brookfield and Jessie McGee. They’re probably in the booth recording as you read this!\n\nAUDIO SERIES\nEach day, Noa’s editor’s select the very best audio articles and add them to topic-specific playlists. Every Series begins with a short explainer – written by a Noa editor – that provides valuable context on the subject at hand before you dive in. Within 20-30 minutes, you’ll walk away fully informed.\n\nAUDIO FEATURES\nAlong with the usual audio features, you’ll find: CarPlay, AirPlay, Offline Mode, Sleep Timer, Playback Speed Adjustment, an editable Article Queue, and Rewind and Fast-forward.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nWe know you expect more. That’s why the Noa app also offers:\n• In-app chat (we respond quickly)\n• My Stats to view your daily streak and listening stats\n• Save, Download, and Follow\n• Share – articles and Series\n• Read Along\n\nALWAYS FREE\nYou can listen to the free tier of Noa without any need to pay.

From politics to culture, current affairs to reviews, a wide range of topics are intelligently commented on daily and in our monthly magazine.\n\nThe Spectator was established in 1828 in Britain. In 2018, after a mere 190 years, we launched our US edition, with the goal of bringing the same insight, original thought and writing to an American audience. \n\nWe hold no party line; our only allegiance is to clarity of thought, elegance of expression and independence of opinion. Our writers opinions range from left to right, their circumstances vary. We do not strive for impartiality — our motto is ‘firm, but unfair’ — but for originality and style.\n\n\"At last Britain’s foremost periodical, first published 1828, brings the English language to America. Here is the native tongue of wit, learning, and sense — wise rather than wised-up, clever but not too clever by half, and humorous in a way that answers to every humor including blood, phlegm, and bile of diverse colors. Civilized reading for barbarous times.\"\n-P.J. O'Rourke on The Spectator \n\n\"You can go to hell—you and your irrelevant rag.\" \n-Sebastian Gorka\n\nFeatures\n-The Spectator's US edition app is free to download. Purchase single editions or subscribe to The Spectator through our website at spectator.us/subscribe.\n-Read every issue monthly before it goes on sale.\n-Download the magazine and read it offline or on the move.\n-Listen to Spectator podcasts.\n-Share articles via email, Facebook and Twitter.\n-Store and access your back issues or store individual articles in your person scrapbook.\n\n\"A fantastic magazine.\" \n-Tucker Carlson\n\n\"The Spectator US is serious without being earnest, lively without being superficial, au courant without being trendy.

Sie enthält Kommentare, Analysen, Storys, Hintergründe, die speziell mit Fokus auf Deutschland erstellt wurden.\n\nPermanente Updates. Die Weltwoche wird zu einem eigentlichen Newsportal, das die relevanten Ereignisse aus der Aktualität abdeckt und kommentierend einordnet. Das heisst: Die Seite wird täglich mehrmals mit neuen Inhalten bespielt.\n\nHi-Performance-Design. Zentral wird auf der neuen Weltwoche die Textillustration. Die digitale Leserforschung hat gezeigt, dass das richtig gewählte Aufmacherbild in Kombination mit einer prägnant formulierten Headline für viele Leser den Einstieg in einen Text massiv erleichtert. Diese Erkenntnis haben wir uns zu eigen gemacht und Layout sowie Textproduktion entsprechend umgestellt. Entstanden ist dabei ein Informationsdesign, das in seiner Reduktion und Übersichtlichkeit eher an bekannte Social-Media-Plattformen erinnert als an herkömmliches Web-Zeitungsdesign. Es wurde zudem gezielt für Mobile entwickelt.\n\nDie Zeiten könnten nicht besser sein. Allenthalben wird Diversity eingefordert. Die Weltwoche ist mit ihrer App vorne dabei und feiert die Vielfalt der Meinungen.\n\nUnd nun: Steigen Sie ein, fliegen Sie mit!\n\nNutzungsbedingungen: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Trout Fisher has been New Zealand's only dedicated trout fishing periodical since 1991.\n\nIt's 100% Kiwi Owned & Produced.\n\nAIM: To promote New Zealand trout fishing in the spirit of public ownership.\n\nIts owner, publisher and editor describes himself as \"a classic fly fisher but atypical magazine purchaser\", meaning that he fly fishes impulsively but only buys magazines deliberately, and very few at that. Typically, he feels, magazines are 66% advertising and 33% reading, offering little value to the reader. Although advertising is always welcomed then, it’s fair to say Trout Fisher remains a deliberate attempt to achieve the reverse.\n\nThe magazine began when the publisher contracted rheumatoid arthritis and was forced to create new work. He had never published anything other than reports before, but a trout fishing magazine looked a fully viable (not to mention highly attractive) solution.\n\nThe initial intention was simply to produce a retirement fund but as the magazine’s scope expanded and publishing knowledge grew, that intent rapidly became something much larger.\n\nOriginally a single folded black-and-white A4 newsletter, New Zealand Trout Fisher has steadily progressed to the 48-page full colour magazine it is now; firstly entirely through direct sales and currently, a combination of direct and distributor sales. Subscriptions are handled in-house and are available in both print and digital form.\n\nMaybe one day the publisher will retire then, but it’s hard to see that happening when producing the magazine has become such an integral part of our lives; not to mention, so much fun. So for now the intention is to keep going until either old age dictates or, if he wishes, his son takes over.\n\nMagazine Subscriptions are available for purchase inside this app.\n\nOne year subscription - $39.99 (automatically renewed until canceled)\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYour iTunes account will automatically be charged at the same price for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period unless you change your subscription preferences in your account settings.\n\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your account settings after purchase on your device.\n\nNo cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nPlease visit http://www.magzter.com/ns/privacy-policy.html for our Privacy Policy and http://www.magzter.com/ns/terms_condition.html  for our Terms & Conditions"

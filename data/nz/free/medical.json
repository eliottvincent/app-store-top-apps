The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "\"Most credible OCD App\" - One Mind PsyberGuide\nGG OCD is a one-stop-shop for simple, research backed mental health exercises. \nJoin the thousands already using the app, reducing anxiety and experiencing better well being by self-managing their condition.\n\nCHANGING OBSESSIVE THINKING IS SIMPLE\nDiscard unsupportive thoughts. Embrace positive ones. Learn to identify your inner monologue and respond quickly. Train daily for 14 days, 3 minutes each day, and improve your wellness.\n\nTHE SCIENCE BACKED APP\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG OCD.\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, OCD and maladaptive thinking.\n\nHOW GG OCD WORKS\nThe app is designed to:\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thinking habits\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts\n3. Increase your access to helpful and positive thoughts\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes\n5. Reduce anxiety and depression\n6. Provide daily mood and self-esteem boost\n\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool\n2. It helps build and maintain healthy thinking habits\n3. It is shown to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries and obsessions\n\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\nThe longer we exercise and make it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\n\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\n\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.\n\nYou can also test yourself to see how well you progress with our self assessment tool.\n\n3 minutes a day? Are you kidding?\nWhen we started working on the app, we knew that if we want to have a positive impact on people's mental health, we'd better make it easy for them to improve. We designed the 3 minute daily exercise program, and began studying the effect. Fortunately, the results were good. \n\nRemember: positive change doesn't happen during training. It happens when you utilize supportive thinking in real life.\n\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious obsessive cycle.\n---\nIN-APP PURCHASE INFORMATION\n\nThe app includes 15 free levels for training on some of the basic topics. The rest of the levels (over 30) can be accessed with a purchase. There are 2 purchase options:\n\n1. AUTO RENEWABLE SUBSCRIPTION\nFor $11.99 a month, you can train as long as you find the app useful.\nFor $59.99 ($5 per month) you can build and maintain a healthy habit for a whole year\n\n2. PERMANENT SUBSCRIPTION\nPay once to unlock all content forever (including upcoming expansions and additional journeys).\n\nPrivacy policy: \nhttp://ggtude.com/privacy-policy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://ggtude.com/terms-of-use\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information on this app is not intended to be a substitution for diagnosis, treatment, or informed professional advice. You should not take any action or avoid taking any action without consulting with a qualified mental health professional."

In 'Poo Goes Home to Pooland', the problem is embodied in a troublesome character and placed externally to the child. This process aims to place some distance between the child and the blame shame of soiling. This helps to free them from their fears and may mobilise previously beleaguered resources within the child and their family.  'Externalising' stories have proved valuable in engaging children in behavioural treatment programmes wihtin a family therapy context. However, you may find them useful in combination with your chosen therapeutic style.   The style and content of 'Poo Goes Home to Pooland; was designed to suit the cognitive development stage of children up to around seven years of age. Individually illustrations and accompanying text is intended to promote understanding of toileting matters and relieve anxiety. They cover topics such as sharing unhappy feeling and how to reorganise when you need to poo.  Talking about 'Pooland' might help you to engage in getting control over their poo.\n\nDr Tamsin Black wrote and illustrated ‘Poo Goes Home to Pooland’ in her final year of Doctoral Training in Clinical Psychology at the University of Newcastle and on clinical placement (with John Sands, Consultant Clinical Psychologist) at the Linhope Unit, Ashington, part of Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust. She is now a mother of three and working as a Consultant Clinical Psychologist in East London.\n\nERIC the UK’s only childhood continence charity provides information, support and resources to improve the quality of life of children, young people and their families who suffer from the consequences of wetting and soiling difficulties.

Bond with your baby instead of trying to remember which breast side to feed from, when your little one pooped or how long it has been since the last nap.\r\n\r\nWe talked with new moms to understand their needs and wishes; that’s how we came up with the SuperMama app. It keeps all newborn’s data readily at hand and lets you be more organized. Besides standard events, you can log info about medicines, baths, allergies and make custom notes. SuperMama app can be a game changer for new parents. It helps you plan your day and gives you more time for yourself, if you’re a mompreneur, for example.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can track with SuperMama:\r\n* Breastfeeding:  log nursing time, set reminders and remember which side you last breastfed on (this is important to avoid plugged milk and mastitis);\r\n* Breast pumping:  track the volume to be sure that there is enough milk pumped;\r\n* Diaper changes:  take care of your baby’s delicate skin and keep track of his/her bowel movements;\r\n* Bottle feeding:  log the volume of formula, pumped milk, water or juice;\r\n* Sleep:  track duration, notice patterns and evaluate the quality of your little angel’s sleeps;\r\n* Growth:  record baby’s weight, height and head circumference, update these numbers whenever you want and watch the progress with growth charts;\r\n* Custom events:  choose from existing (meds, tummy time, complementary foods) or create your own. \r\n\r\nAll data is presented in a slick and easily accessible way. There are also easy-to-read graphs which help to see important trends of baby’s development. We’ve created a tool that benefits mom, baby and dad (yes, he can track child’s activity too!), making those first months of parenting a stress-free experience. Have everything under control with SuperMama!\r\n \r\nShare your views and comments via support@supermama.io and we’ll tweak the app just for you! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nTerms of Service: https://supermama.io/terms\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://supermama.io/privacy"

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

You might want to know if their glucose levels go too high or too low, be able to quickly and easily access their insulin pump and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system information. \r\n \r\nWith the CareLink™ Connect app, now you can remotely see their glucose levels and insulin pump information wherever you are, so you can know how they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app helps you quickly accomplish these tasks: \r\nLet you securely view glucose levels, graphs, and trends\r\nSends you high or low glucose levels notifications, so you can be informed and supportive\r\nShows you the status of the insulin pump system, for greater peace of mind\r\n\r\nTo remotely view pump system information, family members or friends need to install the CareLink™ Connect app on their compatible mobile device. Also, the person with diabetes needs a MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump, the MiniMed™ Mobile app installed on a compatible mobile device, which then should be connected online to the CareLink™ software. To find a list of compatible devices, please visit your local Medtronic website. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: In order to receive real-time updates, the app needs to continuously receive data from the CareLink™ servers, and the insulin pump system needs to sync with the CareLink™ servers through the MiniMed™ Mobile app. The CareLink™ Connect app only works with the MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump systems; it currently does not support other standalone CGM systems, MiniMed™ or Paradigm™ insulin pumps. \r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app is intended to provide a secondary display of insulin pump and CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) system data on a supported mobile device. CareLink™ Connect app is not intended to replace the real-time display of insulin pump or CGM data on the primary display device. All therapy decisions should be based on the primary display device.\r\n\r\nCareLink™ Connect app is not intended to analyze or modify the insulin pump and CGM data that it receives.

The research underlying this app has proven 81% - 83% accurate in the early detection of autism.\r\n\r\nAssessments take only 20-30 minutes, and parents can review their answers before submitting.\r\n\r\nAs autism and related conditions can develop over time, the app contains 3 assessments: for children aged 12, 18 and 24 months.\r\n\r\nOur early autism detection method is the most effective technique available to professionals to monitor early signs of autism and since ASDetect launched in 2015, this method has also helped thousands of families.\r\n\r\nAbout the Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre (OTARC)\r\n\r\nOTARC is Australia's first centre dedicated to autism research. It was established in 2008 at La Trobe University and its mission is to expand knowledge to enrich the lives of autistic people and their families."

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device.

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

Ask your healthcare provider to hear more about Miiskin PRO.\n\n* PHOTOS AND TELEHEALTH with anyone you like. Ask your doctor and healthcare provider about your usage of the app and if they can receive photos for telehealth consultations or triage. Always follow your doctor’s instructions.\n\n* CLOSE-UP PHOTOGRAPHY used for tracking changes in single moles and other local areas on the skin. Miiskin has carefully calibrated the camera for the best possible close-up photography. Log the location on a body chart / map.\n\n* IN-APP COMPARISON allows you to get a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW of your photos so you can more easily compare them for changes over time.\n\n* AUTOMATIC SKIN IMAGING using computer vision and augmented reality technology makes the app capable of taking FULL-BODY IMAGES of you. All you need to do is to place the phone upright on a table with the camera facing the room and it does the rest. Currently available for iPhone XR, XS, 11, 11Pro and SE 2020.\n\n* MOLE SIZING helps you measure your moles and lesions over time. Simply add a coin into your close-up photos.\n\n* FACE TRACKING lets you take selfies from multiple-angles in seconds to track e.g. acne or skincare results\n\n* WEB COMPARE allows you to access your Miiskin App photos in the browser on any tablet or computer with a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW. Very useful for you to compare your full-body images for any changes on a larger screen.\n\n* SECURITY AND PRIVACY is a big priority for us. Miiskin separates your photos from your normal camera roll and encrypts them so no other apps can access them. You can protect them even more with a PIN-code or your Face/Touch ID and BLUR OUT areas of your full-body photos that you wish to stay private even if you share your photos.\n\nMIISKIN DOES NOT PROVIDE A DIAGNOSIS\nThe app does not diagnose your moles or evaluate the risk of melanoma, skin cancer or any other conditions. The app assists you with tracking skin and moles over time with a photo diary. We do not think that with today’s technology, and the present quality of smartphone images, that it is possible to provide AI diagnoses of melanoma or skin cancer risk. Therefore, we opt not to attempt to do that.\n\nIf you find a mole or mark that looks concerning you should always consult a certified doctor.\n\nTHE VISION OF MIISKIN\nMiiskin’s vision is to help you keep track of skin changes and skin conditions in the most user-friendly way possible.\n\nMIISKIN PREMIUM\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

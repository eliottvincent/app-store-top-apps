The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

Now you can check your glucose by scanning your sensor with your phone or use FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors to receive alarms when your glucose is low or high. [1] [2]\r\n\r\nYou can use the FreeStyle LibreLink app to:\r\n\r\n* View your current glucose reading, trend arrow and glucose history\r\n* Receive low or high glucose alarms with FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors [2] \r\n* Add notes to track your food, insulin use and exercise\r\n* See reports, such as Time in Range and Daily Patterns\r\n* Share your data with your doctor and family, with your permission\r\n\r\nSMARTPHONE COMPATIBILITY\r\nCompatibility may vary between phones and operating systems. Learn more about compatible phones at http://FreeStyleLibre.com.\r\n\r\nUSING YOUR APP AND READER WITH THE SAME SENSOR\r\nAlarms can only be issued on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader or your phone (not both). To receive alarms on your phone, you must start the sensor with the app. To receive alarms on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader, you must start the sensor with your reader. Once the sensor has been started with the reader, you can also scan that sensor with your phone.\r\n\r\nRemember that the app and reader do not share data with each other. For complete information on a device, scan your sensor every eight hours with that device; otherwise, your reports will not include all your data. You can upload and view data from all of your devices on LibreView.com.\r\n\r\nAPP INFORMATION\r\nFreeStyle LibreLink is intended for measuring glucose levels in people with diabetes when used with a sensor. For more information on how to use FreeStyle LibreLink, refer to the User’s Manual, which can be accessed through the app. If you require a printed User’s Manual, contact Abbott Diabetes Care Customer Support.\r\n\r\nConsult a healthcare professional to confirm if this product is right for you or if you have questions about how to use this product to make treatment decisions.\r\n\r\nLearn more at http://FreeStyleLibre.com.\r\n\r\n[1] If you are using the FreeStyle LibreLink app, you must also have access to a blood glucose monitoring system, as the app does not provide one.  \r\n\r\n[2] Alarms that you receive do not include your glucose reading, so you must scan your sensor to check your glucose.\r\n\r\n[3] Use of FreeStyle LibreLink and LibreLinkUp requires registration with LibreView.\r\n\r\nFreeStyle, Libre, and related brand marks are marks of Abbott. Other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\r\n\r\nFor additional legal notices and terms of use, go to http://FreeStyleLibre.com.\r\n\r\n========\r\n\r\nTo resolve any technical or Customer Service issues that you are having with a FreeStyle Libre product, please contact FreeStyle Libre Customer Service directly."

Scanoma checks your moles, tells you if your image resembles confirmed skin cancer images, and connects you with trained dermatologists for a professional second opinion.\n\nWith the power of computer vision and the expertise of licensed medical practitioners, scanoma helps your learn about skin issues and get feedback on worrisome skin problems. Simply snap a picture of your mole and then send it to a scanoma doctor for a checkup. \n\nWith scanoma, get a free diagnosis with our AI algorithm trained from thousands of images and get a second opinion from a trained dermatologist from the privacy of your home and using your iPhone. Detect skin cancer risks today.\n\nTake care of your skin and make sure you get it checked often with scanoma. \n\nSupport:\nsupport@scanoma.com\n\nDISCLAIMERS \n-------\n- Scanoma does not replace a human doctor. Computer vision is not 100% accurate. scanoma tells you if your image looks like a regular mole or skin cancer based on similar confirmed patient images. \n- Results are only applicable to moles. (a picture of anything other than a mole will not provide reliable results.  (birthmarks, various objects, things that are not moles) \n- The free scanoma AI exam does not replace physical evaluation of skin cancer by a trained doctor. If in doubt, connect with a dermatologist on scanoma for a second opinion (consultation fee),  or have your skin issues physically checked by a local dermatologists. \n- scanoma works best with clear, unobstructed skin images. At this point scanoma does not work with tattooed skin.  \n- scanoma works best with push notifications enabled. Make sure scanoma notifications are enabled by going to settings-> scanoma -> allow notifications\n-Scanoma is not suitable for children. If you child is under the age of 13, please visit a paediatrician for a diagnosis. \n\nFor feedback and questions send us an email to: support@scanoma.com"

      "label": "\"Most credible OCD App\" - One Mind PsyberGuide\nGG OCD is a one-stop-shop for simple, research backed mental health exercises. \nJoin the thousands already using the app, reducing anxiety and experiencing better well being by self-managing their condition.\n\nCHANGING OBSESSIVE THINKING IS SIMPLE\nDiscard unsupportive thoughts. Embrace positive ones. Learn to identify your inner monologue and respond quickly. Train daily for 14 days, 3 minutes each day, and improve your wellness.\n\nTHE SCIENCE BACKED APP\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG OCD.\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, OCD and maladaptive thinking.\n\nHOW GG OCD WORKS\nThe app is designed to:\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thinking habits\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts\n3. Increase your access to helpful and positive thoughts\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes\n5. Reduce anxiety and depression\n6. Provide daily mood and self-esteem boost\n\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool\n2. It helps build and maintain healthy thinking habits\n3. It is shown to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries and obsessions\n\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\nThe longer we exercise and make it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\n\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\n\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.\n\nYou can also test yourself to see how well you progress with our self assessment tool.\n\n3 minutes a day? Are you kidding?\nWhen we started working on the app, we knew that if we want to have a positive impact on people's mental health, we'd better make it easy for them to improve. We designed the 3 minute daily exercise program, and began studying the effect. Fortunately, the results were good. \n\nRemember: positive change doesn't happen during training. It happens when you utilize supportive thinking in real life.\n\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious obsessive cycle.\n---\nIN-APP PURCHASE INFORMATION\n\nThe app includes 15 free levels for training on some of the basic topics. The rest of the levels (over 30) can be accessed with a purchase. There are 2 purchase options:\n\n1. AUTO RENEWABLE SUBSCRIPTION\nFor $11.99 a month, you can train as long as you find the app useful.\nFor $59.99 ($5 per month) you can build and maintain a healthy habit for a whole year\n\n2. PERMANENT SUBSCRIPTION\nPay once to unlock all content forever (including upcoming expansions and additional journeys).\n\nPrivacy policy: \nhttp://ggtude.com/privacy-policy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://ggtude.com/terms-of-use\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information on this app is not intended to be a substitution for diagnosis, treatment, or informed professional advice. You should not take any action or avoid taking any action without consulting with a qualified mental health professional."

Bond with your baby instead of trying to remember which breast side to feed from, when your little one pooped or how long it has been since the last nap.\r\n\r\nWe talked with new moms to understand their needs and wishes; that’s how we came up with the SuperMama app. It keeps all newborn’s data readily at hand and lets you be more organized. Besides standard events, you can log info about medicines, baths, allergies and make custom notes. SuperMama app can be a game changer for new parents. It helps you plan your day and gives you more time for yourself, if you’re a mompreneur, for example.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can track with SuperMama:\r\n* Breastfeeding:  log nursing time, set reminders and remember which side you last breastfed on (this is important to avoid plugged milk and mastitis);\r\n* Breast pumping:  track the volume to be sure that there is enough milk pumped;\r\n* Diaper changes:  take care of your baby’s delicate skin and keep track of his/her bowel movements;\r\n* Bottle feeding:  log the volume of formula, pumped milk, water or juice;\r\n* Sleep:  track duration, notice patterns and evaluate the quality of your little angel’s sleeps;\r\n* Growth:  record baby’s weight, height and head circumference, update these numbers whenever you want and watch the progress with growth charts;\r\n* Custom events:  choose from existing (meds, tummy time, complementary foods) or create your own. \r\n\r\nAll data is presented in a slick and easily accessible way. There are also easy-to-read graphs which help to see important trends of baby’s development. We’ve created a tool that benefits mom, baby and dad (yes, he can track child’s activity too!), making those first months of parenting a stress-free experience. Have everything under control with SuperMama!\r\n \r\nShare your views and comments via support@supermama.io and we’ll tweak the app just for you! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nTerms of Service: https://supermama.io/terms\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://supermama.io/privacy"

The research underlying this app has proven 81% - 83% accurate in the early detection of autism.\r\n\r\nAssessments take only 20-30 minutes, and parents can review their answers before submitting.\r\n\r\nAs autism and related conditions can develop over time, the app contains 3 assessments: for children aged 12, 18 and 24 months.\r\n\r\nOur early autism detection method is the most effective technique available to professionals to monitor early signs of autism and since ASDetect launched in 2015, this method has also helped thousands of families.\r\n\r\nAbout the Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre (OTARC)\r\n\r\nOTARC is Australia's first centre dedicated to autism research. It was established in 2008 at La Trobe University and its mission is to expand knowledge to enrich the lives of autistic people and their families."

      "label": "Blood pressure monitor & heart rate tracker app - Our application does not measure blood pressure. The app allows you to track it. For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

It is not easy to find a dermatologist appointment nowadays because the demand for skin doctors and skin consultants is on the rise but their number is decreasing. This online telemedicine app allows you to access your virtual doctor to help you find out about your skin diseases, skin problems, or suspicious moles. We are answering the need for doctor demand for patients who can't reach a skin doctor easily.\n\nFAQ\n Are all cases evaluated by a dermatologist or skin specialist?\n-- Yes, they are all evaluated only by a dermatologist.\n\nWhat do you mean by doctor on demand app?\n-- It is like a virtual doctor app that is designed to access a dermatologist fast and easy way.  \n\n What if I don't get results?\n-- You will get a full refund of your money.\n\n Attention, recommendations are not a replacement for comprehensive doctor control and diagnosis. It is your responsibility to make decisions about your health."

      "label": "Summary: My Weight Loss Journey (MWLJ) is a patient-facing mobile application that provides tailored risk and benefit estimates for bariatric surgery treatment options. MWLJ also provides patients with the ability to track their weight loss and to establish and maintain longitudinal relationships with their care team with the goal of cultivating accountability and decreasing the incidence of weight regain after surgery.\r\n\r\nFunctionality: MWLJ uses a proprietary risk/benefit calculator developed by researchers at the University of Michigan and based on data from past patients. The following information is entered in a survey form by the user to generate the estimates: age, gender, height, weight, race, insurance type, preferred procedure type, mobility status, smoking history, and current medication use. This information is used to generate risk and benefit graphs for each of two main procedure types (sleeve gastrectomy and roux-en-y gastric bypass). The types of risks presented by the app include minor complications (wound infection, pneumonia, UTI, etc.) and serious complications (leak, abscess, reoperations, etc.). The types of benefits presented include weight loss and resolution of comorbidities following surgery. Additional functionality upon survey completion includes a detailed description and typical pre- and post-operative timelines for each surgical procedure type, information about how to manage life after surgery, as well as the opportunity to compare the risks and benefits of one procedure type against those of the other.\r\n\r\nAdditional Features: Additional features upon survey completion include access to video testimonials from former patients on their lives before and after surgery, a personalized check-in portal where patients can log back into the app and track their weight loss, and email messages encouraging patients to return to the app at various times throughout their post-operative journey. These messages highlight important topics to help manage potential concerns about weight loss treatment.\r\n\r\nMWLJ was developed by the University of Michigan, with funding from its Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and in conjunction with the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative (MBSC), a Blue Cross Blue Shield/ Blue Care Network of Michigan-sponsored consortium of bariatric surgeons and hospitals across the state of Michigan. MBSC aims to advance the science and practice of bariatric surgery in Michigan and across the U.S. The program is a unique partnership among Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, University of Michigan researchers, and clinicians from the 43 bariatric surgery programs across the state."

Using a combination of multiple test algorithms, we developed the test, which consider a wide range of factors and is able to recognize smaller nuances than any other risk calculator. After completing a brief questionnaire with pictures, you would learn whether you have any suspicious pigment mark on your skin or whether there is a potential risk of melanoma. This user-friendly application excels in its simplicity of use and is a great aid in preventing this disease. \n\nAbout 30-50 % of melanomas develop from a pigment mark. Melanoma is a malignant tumour of melanocytes which mostly develops on the skin. It is one of the less frequent types of skin cancer, but causes the highest number of deaths from these tumour diseases.\n\nIn most cases, the health symptoms are initial transformation of a static pigment mark, the early removal of which often prevents development of a malignant tumour.\n \nGet a test of your risk of developing melanoma thanks to this mobile application, since prevention is one of the most effective weapons against this disease. There is nothing simpler than to get examined by a dermatologist in case of any suspicion, rule out the risk of cancer, and be sure you are healthy.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "\"Most credible OCD App\" - One Mind PsyberGuide\nGG OCD is a one-stop-shop for simple, research backed mental health exercises. \nJoin the thousands already using the app, reducing anxiety and experiencing better well being by self-managing their condition.\n\nCHANGING OBSESSIVE THINKING IS SIMPLE\nDiscard unsupportive thoughts. Embrace positive ones. Learn to identify your inner monologue and respond quickly. Train daily for 14 days, 3 minutes each day, and improve your wellness.\n\nTHE SCIENCE BACKED APP\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG OCD.\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, OCD and maladaptive thinking.\n\nHOW GG OCD WORKS\nThe app is designed to:\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thinking habits\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts\n3. Increase your access to helpful and positive thoughts\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes\n5. Reduce anxiety and depression\n6. Provide daily mood and self-esteem boost\n\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool\n2. It helps build and maintain healthy thinking habits\n3. It is shown to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries and obsessions\n\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\nThe longer we exercise and make it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\n\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\n\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.\n\nYou can also test yourself to see how well you progress with our self assessment tool.\n\n3 minutes a day? Are you kidding?\nWhen we started working on the app, we knew that if we want to have a positive impact on people's mental health, we'd better make it easy for them to improve. We designed the 3 minute daily exercise program, and began studying the effect. Fortunately, the results were good. \n\nRemember: positive change doesn't happen during training. It happens when you utilize supportive thinking in real life.\n\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious obsessive cycle.\n---\nIN-APP PURCHASE INFORMATION\n\nThe app includes 15 free levels for training on some of the basic topics. The rest of the levels (over 30) can be accessed with a purchase. There are 2 purchase options:\n\n1. AUTO RENEWABLE SUBSCRIPTION\nFor $11.99 a month, you can train as long as you find the app useful.\nFor $59.99 ($5 per month) you can build and maintain a healthy habit for a whole year\n\n2. PERMANENT SUBSCRIPTION\nPay once to unlock all content forever (including upcoming expansions and additional journeys).\n\nPrivacy policy: \nhttp://ggtude.com/privacy-policy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://ggtude.com/terms-of-use\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information on this app is not intended to be a substitution for diagnosis, treatment, or informed professional advice.

The research underlying this app has proven 81% - 83% accurate in the early detection of autism.\r\n\r\nAssessments take only 20-30 minutes, and parents can review their answers before submitting.\r\n\r\nAs autism and related conditions can develop over time, the app contains 3 assessments: for children aged 12, 18 and 24 months.\r\n\r\nOur early autism detection method is the most effective technique available to professionals to monitor early signs of autism and since ASDetect launched in 2015, this method has also helped thousands of families.\r\n\r\nAbout the Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre (OTARC)\r\n\r\nOTARC is Australia's first centre dedicated to autism research. It was established in 2008 at La Trobe University and its mission is to expand knowledge to enrich the lives of autistic people and their families."

Bond with your baby instead of trying to remember which breast side to feed from, when your little one pooped or how long it has been since the last nap.\r\n\r\nWe talked with new moms to understand their needs and wishes; that’s how we came up with the SuperMama app. It keeps all newborn’s data readily at hand and lets you be more organized. Besides standard events, you can log info about medicines, baths, allergies and make custom notes. SuperMama app can be a game changer for new parents. It helps you plan your day and gives you more time for yourself, if you’re a mompreneur, for example.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can track with SuperMama:\r\n* Breastfeeding:  log nursing time, set reminders and remember which side you last breastfed on (this is important to avoid plugged milk and mastitis);\r\n* Breast pumping:  track the volume to be sure that there is enough milk pumped;\r\n* Diaper changes:  take care of your baby’s delicate skin and keep track of his/her bowel movements;\r\n* Bottle feeding:  log the volume of formula, pumped milk, water or juice;\r\n* Sleep:  track duration, notice patterns and evaluate the quality of your little angel’s sleeps;\r\n* Growth:  record baby’s weight, height and head circumference, update these numbers whenever you want and watch the progress with growth charts;\r\n* Custom events:  choose from existing (meds, tummy time, complementary foods) or create your own. \r\n\r\nAll data is presented in a slick and easily accessible way. There are also easy-to-read graphs which help to see important trends of baby’s development. We’ve created a tool that benefits mom, baby and dad (yes, he can track child’s activity too!), making those first months of parenting a stress-free experience. Have everything under control with SuperMama!\r\n \r\nShare your views and comments via support@supermama.io and we’ll tweak the app just for you! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nTerms of Service: https://supermama.io/terms\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://supermama.io/privacy"

Go through all checks, the scores will be automatically added. The higher the score the sicker the baby is likely to be. This app has been designed to help you decide whether your baby needs a doctor.  Although it is accurate most of the time, its advice cannot be guaranteed. If you are still worried about your baby, consult a doctor.\n\nThe Lullaby Trust Baby Check was developed from a 4-year project which analysed the signs and symptoms of illness in over 1,000 babies under 6 months of age. There were 300 well babies at home and 700 babies in hospital with a variety of illnesses. All signs and symptoms were analysed to find the combination which could be used to assess the severity of a baby’s illness with the most accuracy. The 19 signs and symptoms now used in Baby Check were found to give the most accurate assessment.\n \nThe accuracy and acceptability of The Lullaby Trust Baby Check has been tested in several field trials.\n \n Acknowledgments:\nThe parents and babies who assisted with the research project and: The Friends of the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths; Australian Institute of Health; Ross Trust; Felton Bequests; H & L Hecht Trust; Percy Baxter Charitable Trust; A Williams Private Fund.

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

Scanoma checks your moles, tells you if your image resembles confirmed skin cancer images, and connects you with trained dermatologists for a professional second opinion.\n\nWith the power of computer vision and the expertise of licensed medical practitioners, scanoma helps your learn about skin issues and get feedback on worrisome skin problems. Simply snap a picture of your mole and then send it to a scanoma doctor for a checkup. \n\nWith scanoma, get a free diagnosis with our AI algorithm trained from thousands of images and get a second opinion from a trained dermatologist from the privacy of your home and using your iPhone. Detect skin cancer risks today.\n\nTake care of your skin and make sure you get it checked often with scanoma. \n\nSupport:\nsupport@scanoma.com\n\nDISCLAIMERS \n-------\n- Scanoma does not replace a human doctor. Computer vision is not 100% accurate. scanoma tells you if your image looks like a regular mole or skin cancer based on similar confirmed patient images. \n- Results are only applicable to moles. (a picture of anything other than a mole will not provide reliable results.  (birthmarks, various objects, things that are not moles) \n- The free scanoma AI exam does not replace physical evaluation of skin cancer by a trained doctor. If in doubt, connect with a dermatologist on scanoma for a second opinion (consultation fee),  or have your skin issues physically checked by a local dermatologists. \n- scanoma works best with clear, unobstructed skin images. At this point scanoma does not work with tattooed skin.  \n- scanoma works best with push notifications enabled. Make sure scanoma notifications are enabled by going to settings-> scanoma -> allow notifications\n-Scanoma is not suitable for children. If you child is under the age of 13, please visit a paediatrician for a diagnosis. \n\nFor feedback and questions send us an email to: support@scanoma.com"

The app allows the Ministry of Health (MOH) to give you timely care and guidance, protecting you and those around you.\n\nThe app uses Bluetooth, and your Bluetooth data is stored securely on your phone. It’ll be shared with MOH if you test positive for COVID-19, for the purpose of contact tracing. Also, all Bluetooth data stored on your phone is automatically deleted after 25 days.\n\nTraceTogether helps us ensure that we don’t spread the virus to our loved ones unknowingly. It also helps us support the work of contact tracers and healthcare workers by combating the spread of COVID-19 together.\n\nApp functionality will cease once the outbreak ends.\n\nTraceTogether is designed for use by people in Singapore. To register, you will need a valid NRIC, FIN, or a valid document of your current stay in Singapore."

      "label": "Congratulations on your pregnancy! With this app we would like to give you a helpful tool, which will make food safety and good nutrition as simple as possible for you for the next nine months. What types of fish contain the least amount of mercury? Which types of cheese should you first strike off of your shopping list? And attending your next business lunch; what can you eat without worrying whether you’ll get toxoplasmosis? This app features a traffic light food labelling system of almost 1000 foodstuffs – they are categorized according to the level of danger to the unborn baby. Due to the background information and advice, you will feel more secure in the complex evaluation of the safety of unknown foods.\n\nHow the app works:\nAt first there is a theoretic part, which informs you in a nutshell about the most common foodborne diseases (toxoplasmosis, listeriosis, and salmonella.)\nThe core of the app is the food search. Here you can initially choose between an alphabetic or a filtered search. At first glance you can see whether a foodstuff is classified as green, orange or red.\nGreen-labelled food means that pregnant women can generally consume it safely - even if it is not necessarily healthy. Of course calories and nutritional value are another matter. On the same note, the permitted foods are always allowed in moderation. This applies especially to spices, herbs, and nuts. If you have a varied and balanced diet, you don't have to worry anymore. Orange let's you know that the safe consumption of the foodstuff depends on several factors (time of pregnancy, personal situation, the art of preparation, quantity, ...) But do not worry at first about the quantity of the orange entries, but do note the advice. Just click on the corresponding food label. You should absolutely avoid all red-labelled foodstuffs. They affect the development of your baby and damage it in the long-term.\n\nUsing the filtered search, however, you can adapt the list of the various risks and food categories to your individual situation. You can easily browse all accessible foods. Or you can filter through food categories and find out which cheese from your favorite camembert you can replace during the pregnancy.\n\nBy clicking the star you can finally add the desired food to your personal shopping list.\nBy the way, with the help of our hints and advice you will also get guidelines for specific food categories and several more ideas for everyday use. That way you can ensure even greater food safety without getting hysterical.\n\nWe wish you a relaxed pregnancy. All the best!\n\nKirstin & Roman"

      "label": "Suffering from IBS? The Low FODMAP Diet can help relief your symptoms and be free of IBS for good. Low FODMAP Lifestyle is the easiest way to look up which foods are high FODMAP and low FODMAP.\n\nThis app is build by Lifeplano and we know what IBS and the low FODMAP diet is about, because one of our founders have followed it himself. It is a very restrictive diet and therefore harder to follow, but we have made it so much easier with Low FODMAP Lifestyle.\n\n*Functionalities*\n- Low FODMAP food list\n- Personal testing of every food\n- More than 40+ recipes\n- Basic knowledge about IBS and FODMAPs\n\n*What is IBS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome?*\nIBS is a condition where your gut have trouble digesting foods with certain carbohydrates: Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Mannitols and Polyols. Which carbohydrates you react too can be different from others, as the amount also can, which is why it is a very personal diet.\n\nIt is estimated by scientists at the Australian Monash University that 1 in 7 suffers from IBS and it is a lifestyle condition mainly present in western countries.\n\n*What is the Low FODMAP Diet?*\nMonash University are also the inventors of the Low FODMAP Diet. It is a diet that helps you find out exactly what carbohydrates and foods your gut reacts to and in what amount, so you can limit or exclude that from your diet going forward.\n\nThe IBS diet consist of three phases:\n- Phase 1: The eliminations phase - Here you eliminate FODMAPs from your diet until you are symptom free.\n- Phase 2: The reintroduction phase - Here you slowly reintroduce the different carbohydrates, and test which ones cause reactions.\n- Phase 3: The personal diet phase - You now have a personal diet, but IBS can develop over time, so you need to retest foods again to see if your tolerance changed.\n\nWith our app you can also test new foods and drinks that haven't been tested yet and see if you tolerate it. Examples could be a can of Pepsi or ketchup which are both processed groceries with unknown levels of FODMAPs.\n\nThe diet can seem very restrictive if you are new to it, and it is proved that restrictive diets are the hardest to follow. With Low FODMAP Lifestyle we have made the diet more available so it seems easier to follow and less restrictive. Follow our low FODMAP recipes, get symptom free and test new foods every week, to make your personal diet and low FODMAP food list."

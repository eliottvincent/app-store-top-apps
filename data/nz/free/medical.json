Computer vision is not 100% accurate. scanoma tells you if your image looks like a regular mole or skin cancer based on similar confirmed patient images. \n- Results are only applicable to moles. (a picture of anything other than a mole will not provide reliable results.  (birthmarks, various objects, things that are not moles) \n- The free scanoma AI exam does not replace physical evaluation of skin cancer by a trained doctor. If in doubt, connect with a dermatologist on scanoma for a second opinion (consultation fee),  or have your skin issues physically checked by a local dermatologists. \n- scanoma works best with clear, unobstructed skin images. At this point scanoma does not work with tattooed skin.  \n- scanoma works best with push notifications enabled. Make sure scanoma notifications are enabled by going to settings-> scanoma -> allow notifications\n-Scanoma is not suitable for children.

      "label": "\"Most credible OCD App\" - One Mind PsyberGuide\nGG OCD is a one-stop-shop for simple, research backed mental health exercises. \nJoin the thousands already using the app, reducing anxiety and experiencing better well being by self-managing their condition.\n\nCHANGING OBSESSIVE THINKING IS SIMPLE\nDiscard unsupportive thoughts. Embrace positive ones. Learn to identify your inner monologue and respond quickly. Train daily for 14 days, 3 minutes each day, and improve your wellness.\n\nTHE SCIENCE BACKED APP\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG OCD.\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, OCD and maladaptive thinking.\n\nHOW GG OCD WORKS\nThe app is designed to:\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thinking habits\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts\n3. Increase your access to helpful and positive thoughts\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes\n5. Reduce anxiety and depression\n6. Provide daily mood and self-esteem boost\n\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool\n2. It helps build and maintain healthy thinking habits\n3. It is shown to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries and obsessions\n\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\nThe longer we exercise and make it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\n\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\n\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.\n\nYou can also test yourself to see how well you progress with our self assessment tool.\n\n3 minutes a day? Are you kidding?\nWhen we started working on the app, we knew that if we want to have a positive impact on people's mental health, we'd better make it easy for them to improve. We designed the 3 minute daily exercise program, and began studying the effect. Fortunately, the results were good. \n\nRemember: positive change doesn't happen during training. It happens when you utilize supportive thinking in real life.\n\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious obsessive cycle.\n---\nIN-APP PURCHASE INFORMATION\n\nThe app includes 15 free levels for training on some of the basic topics. The rest of the levels (over 30) can be accessed with a purchase. There are 2 purchase options:\n\n1. AUTO RENEWABLE SUBSCRIPTION\nFor $11.99 a month, you can train as long as you find the app useful.\nFor $59.99 ($5 per month) you can build and maintain a healthy habit for a whole year\n\n2. PERMANENT SUBSCRIPTION\nPay once to unlock all content forever (including upcoming expansions and additional journeys).\n\nPrivacy policy: \nhttp://ggtude.com/privacy-policy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://ggtude.com/terms-of-use\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information on this app is not intended to be a substitution for diagnosis, treatment, or informed professional advice. You should not take any action or avoid taking any action without consulting with a qualified mental health professional."

Bond with your baby instead of trying to remember which breast side to feed from, when your little one pooped or how long it has been since the last nap.\r\n\r\nWe talked with new moms to understand their needs and wishes; that’s how we came up with the SuperMama app. It keeps all newborn’s data readily at hand and lets you be more organized. Besides standard events, you can log info about medicines, baths, allergies and make custom notes. SuperMama app can be a game changer for new parents. It helps you plan your day and gives you more time for yourself, if you’re a mompreneur, for example.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can track with SuperMama:\r\n* Breastfeeding:  log nursing time, set reminders and remember which side you last breastfed on (this is important to avoid plugged milk and mastitis);\r\n* Breast pumping:  track the volume to be sure that there is enough milk pumped;\r\n* Diaper changes:  take care of your baby’s delicate skin and keep track of his/her bowel movements;\r\n* Bottle feeding:  log the volume of formula, pumped milk, water or juice;\r\n* Sleep:  track duration, notice patterns and evaluate the quality of your little angel’s sleeps;\r\n* Growth:  record baby’s weight, height and head circumference, update these numbers whenever you want and watch the progress with growth charts;\r\n* Custom events:  choose from existing (meds, tummy time, complementary foods) or create your own. \r\n\r\nAll data is presented in a slick and easily accessible way. There are also easy-to-read graphs which help to see important trends of baby’s development. We’ve created a tool that benefits mom, baby and dad (yes, he can track child’s activity too!), making those first months of parenting a stress-free experience. Have everything under control with SuperMama!\r\n \r\nShare your views and comments via support@supermama.io and we’ll tweak the app just for you! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nTerms of Service: https://supermama.io/terms\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://supermama.io/privacy"

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device.

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

It has been created by practicing anaesthetists with an interest in teaching ultrasound and regional anaesthesia.\n\nAnSo:\n- provides multiple examples of the sonoanatomy as every individual is different,\n- provides landmark sketches useful for developing pattern recognition of landmark structures, and for trainees to draw in exams,\n- displays the cutaneous, motor, osseous and visceral innervation of the numerous nerve blocks and fascial plane blocks now available, facilitating appropriate block choice and knowledge of expected results,\n- allows combining and comparing block innervation,\n- allows images to be flipped to display both L and R sided orientation,\n- demonstrates functional ergonomics with patient, ultrasound screen and proceduralist positioning essential for efficient practical performance,\n- provides block notes with sonoanatomy tips and practical tips from experienced clinicians which can be invaluable to the learner.\n\nAnSo is not only for regional anaesthesia but includes many other perioperative uses of ultrasound relevant to the anaesthetist, such as:\n-      airway\n-      gastric antrum\n-      vascular access\n-      spine\n-      transthoracic echo\n-      lung signs\n\nAnSo contains:\n- over 250 ultrasound images with over 1500 sonoanatomy colour overlays,\n- innervation images,\n- ergonomic images,\n- landmarks pattern sketches,\n- loops when required for dynamic sonoanatomy,\n- notes with tips from experienced clinicians.\n\nAnSo helps identify not only the target structures but all the surrounding sonoanatomy. This more comprehensive understanding of the sonoanatomy helps detect anatomical variability, improves the safety and efficacy of procedures, and facilitates learning and teaching.\nAnSo has been designed in a format that can be easily updated and distributed to users so the information can be kept as current as possible in this rapidly expanding field.\nAnSo does not require an internet connection to run. Once downloaded all data is stored on your device so it will work anywhere and images will display without any delay.  It can be useful both in and out of theatre, when performing procedures, and when learning or teaching ultrasound. There is no advertising in the app making it pleasant and time efficient to use.\nTerms of use can be found at https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nDownload AnSo today and always have access to this sonoanatomy and nerve block resource."

      "label": "The Reversing Warfarin App is designed for doctors to help them manage patients on the anticoagulant warfarin. It will be useful to anaesthetists, emergency specialists, surgeons, general practitioners, cardiologists and haematologists. In fact most clinicians will at some time have patients on anticoagulants and would find this App helpful. \n\nThe Reversing Warfarin App will help you \n• Manage patients with an elevated INR result\n• Provide safe advice to rapidly reverse the INR if bleeding occurs. \n• Develop an appropriate treatment protocol around elective surgery\n• Immediately reverse warfarin prior to emergency surgery \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nFeatures of the Reversing Warfarin App \n\nAn elevated INR\nSimply enter the INR result and get immediate advice about dose reduction and vitamin K dosage if necessary.\n\nManaging bleeding \nBleeding is a potential problem with any anticoagulant and can be complex to manage. With the Reversing Warfarin App you simply enter the INR result, your patient’s weight and the severity of the bleed and get immediate advice including the precise dose of Prothrombinex-VF and vitamin K.\n\nManaging surgery \nDoctors are frequently faced with managing patients on warfarin going for surgery. The reversing Warfarin App enables you to develop a personalised protocol for each patient. For elective surgery cases the App takes you through a series of questions to assess the thrombosis and bleeding risk, and then recommends the most appropriate protocol. You can then enter your patient's details and produce a pdf of the protocol. This can be shared with colleagues or your patient and can be printed out for the medical records. \n\nFor emergency surgery the app provides advice to immediately reverse warfarin to a safe level for surgery and again allows you to print out a protocol.\n\nThe settings allow you to select various low molecular weight heparins so you can personalise the protocol to meet your practice.\n\nReferenced information \nThe recommendations are based on the Australasian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis guidelines (2013) and the American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines (2012). All recommendations are linked to an information page which is appropriately referenced with relevant publications. \n\nWebsite for feedback \nThe Reversing Warfarin App is linked to the HealthObs website to allow you to ask questions, provide feedback or even start a discussion. \n\nWe welcome all feedback. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nThe advice is based on published reviews and guidelines. Extensive efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of the information. \n\nDisclaimer \nThis software is to be used as a guide only and healthcare professionals should use clinical judgement and should individualise care for each patient.

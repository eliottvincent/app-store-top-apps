The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

Scanoma checks your moles, tells you if your image resembles confirmed skin cancer images, and connects you with trained dermatologists for a professional second opinion.\n\nWith the power of computer vision and the expertise of licensed medical practitioners, scanoma helps your learn about skin issues and get feedback on worrisome skin problems. Simply snap a picture of your mole and then send it to a scanoma doctor for a checkup. \n\nWith scanoma, get a free diagnosis with our AI algorithm trained from thousands of images and get a second opinion from a trained dermatologist from the privacy of your home and using your iPhone. Detect skin cancer risks today.\n\nTake care of your skin and make sure you get it checked often with scanoma. \n\nSupport:\nsupport@scanoma.com\n\nDISCLAIMERS \n-------\n- Scanoma does not replace a human doctor. Computer vision is not 100% accurate. scanoma tells you if your image looks like a regular mole or skin cancer based on similar confirmed patient images. \n- Results are only applicable to moles. (a picture of anything other than a mole will not provide reliable results.  (birthmarks, various objects, things that are not moles) \n- The free scanoma AI exam does not replace physical evaluation of skin cancer by a trained doctor. If in doubt, connect with a dermatologist on scanoma for a second opinion (consultation fee),  or have your skin issues physically checked by a local dermatologists. \n- scanoma works best with clear, unobstructed skin images. At this point scanoma does not work with tattooed skin.  \n- scanoma works best with push notifications enabled. Make sure scanoma notifications are enabled by going to settings-> scanoma -> allow notifications\n-Scanoma is not suitable for children. If you child is under the age of 13, please visit a paediatrician for a diagnosis. \n\nFor feedback and questions send us an email to: support@scanoma.com"

      "label": "\"Most credible OCD App\" - One Mind PsyberGuide\nGG OCD is a one-stop-shop for simple, research backed mental health exercises. \nJoin the thousands already using the app, reducing anxiety and experiencing better well being by self-managing their condition.\n\nCHANGING OBSESSIVE THINKING IS SIMPLE\nDiscard unsupportive thoughts. Embrace positive ones. Learn to identify your inner monologue and respond quickly. Train daily for 14 days, 3 minutes each day, and improve your wellness.\n\nTHE SCIENCE BACKED APP\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG OCD.\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, OCD and maladaptive thinking.\n\nHOW GG OCD WORKS\nThe app is designed to:\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thinking habits\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts\n3. Increase your access to helpful and positive thoughts\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes\n5. Reduce anxiety and depression\n6. Provide daily mood and self-esteem boost\n\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool\n2. It helps build and maintain healthy thinking habits\n3. It is shown to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries and obsessions\n\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\nThe longer we exercise and make it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\n\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\n\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.\n\nYou can also test yourself to see how well you progress with our self assessment tool.\n\n3 minutes a day? Are you kidding?\nWhen we started working on the app, we knew that if we want to have a positive impact on people's mental health, we'd better make it easy for them to improve. We designed the 3 minute daily exercise program, and began studying the effect. Fortunately, the results were good. \n\nRemember: positive change doesn't happen during training. It happens when you utilize supportive thinking in real life.\n\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious obsessive cycle.\n---\nIN-APP PURCHASE INFORMATION\n\nThe app includes 15 free levels for training on some of the basic topics. The rest of the levels (over 30) can be accessed with a purchase. There are 2 purchase options:\n\n1. AUTO RENEWABLE SUBSCRIPTION\nFor $11.99 a month, you can train as long as you find the app useful.\nFor $59.99 ($5 per month) you can build and maintain a healthy habit for a whole year\n\n2. PERMANENT SUBSCRIPTION\nPay once to unlock all content forever (including upcoming expansions and additional journeys).\n\nPrivacy policy: \nhttp://ggtude.com/privacy-policy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://ggtude.com/terms-of-use\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information on this app is not intended to be a substitution for diagnosis, treatment, or informed professional advice. You should not take any action or avoid taking any action without consulting with a qualified mental health professional."

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently.

The research underlying this app has proven 81% - 83% accurate in the early detection of autism.\r\n\r\nAssessments take only 20-30 minutes, and parents can review their answers before submitting.\r\n\r\nAs autism and related conditions can develop over time, the app contains 3 assessments: for children aged 12, 18 and 24 months.\r\n\r\nOur early autism detection method is the most effective technique available to professionals to monitor early signs of autism and since ASDetect launched in 2015, this method has also helped thousands of families.\r\n\r\nAbout the Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre (OTARC)\r\n\r\nOTARC is Australia's first centre dedicated to autism research. It was established in 2008 at La Trobe University and its mission is to expand knowledge to enrich the lives of autistic people and their families."

We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

This free tool allows you to track your babies’ movements, and strength of your baby, on a daily basis, while giving you data to share with your provider. In-app messaging empowers you to speak up if there is a change in what’s normal for your baby and provides you with guidance on how to monitor it. Research shows a change in fetal movement can be the earliest and sometimes only indication that a baby is in distress and should be checked by a provider. Kick counting is a great way to bond with your baby, and 78% of app users say it lowers their anxiety during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nCount the Kicks app features include:\r\n- Ability to rate the strength of your baby’s movements\r\n- Ability to download and send kick-counting data directly from the app\r\n- Ability to take notes on each kick-counting session\r\n- Available in 16 languages: Amharic, Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, Dari, English, French, Haitian-Creole, Hebrew, Hindi, Marshallese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, and Vietnamese \r\n- Ability to track movements of single babies or twins\r\n- Easy-to-read graphs that show your baby’s normal movement history\r\n- Login via social media or accounts such as Google or Microsoft\r\n- Daily interactive and educational messages that appear after a kick session has been saved\r\n- Notifications to remind users to count kicks\r\n- An optional survey for users to inform us of their experience using the app and the outcome of their pregnancy\r\n- \"Baby save\" stories within the app and the ability for users to submit a baby save story directly from the app\r\n- Available on Apple Watch and on your desktop computer."

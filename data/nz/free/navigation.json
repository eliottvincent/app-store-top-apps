Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m.

      "label": "Makes from your iPhone/iPad a complete GPS device with detailed topographic maps. Viewed maps will be stored on your device so that Topo GPS can also be used offline.\n\nWhy should you buy an expensive GPS device if you can install Topo GPS? Topo GPS contains all functions of a regular GPS device for less money, has a much more detailed map, and is more convenient to operate. The accuracy of the position determination is in favorable conditions about 5 m.\n\nIdeal for walking, hiking, cycling, mountain biking, sailing, horse-riding, geocaching, scouting, trail running and other outdoor activities. Also suited for outdoor professionals.\n\n- Map\n* To use Topo GPS you need to buy a map.\n* Official topographic maps of many countries, including Great Britain (OS Explorer), New Zealand and Australia are available as in-app purchase. \n* Topographic maps are very detailed maps, include height contours and are very suited for outdoor activities.\n* All maps of a certain region can be made offline accessible using the map download screen.\n* Easy switching between maps.\n\n- Routes\n* Recording routes, with pause and restart possibility.\n* Planning routes via route points.\n* Generating routes\n* Editing routes\n* Synchronization with your other devices via iCloud.\n* Searching routes with filters.\n* Routes can be organized into folders.\n\n- Waypoints\n* Easy adding by pressing long on map.\n* Adding waypoints through address or coordinates.\n* Sharing waypoints.\n* Editing waypoints.\n\n- Layers\nLayers contain information that can be added to and removed from the map.\n* Long distance bicycle routes\n* Mountainbike routes\n\n- Coordinates\n* Easy entering coordinates\n* Scanning coordinates\n* Supported coordinate systems:\nWGS84 decimal, WGS84 degree minutes (seconds), UTM, MGRS, and other country specific coordinate systems.\n* Coordinates grid layers\n\n- Intuitive interface\n* Clear menu with most important functions.\n* Different dashboard panels with distance, time, speed, altitude and coordinates.\n* Clear manual at www.topo-gps.com\n\n- Supported file formats:\n* gpx, kml/kmz, geojson (all also zip compressed), WFS, csv\n\n\nIf you are recording a route, the GPS will run in the background. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nRdzl, the company behind Topo GPS, does not obtain in any way the position of the user of Topo GPS. Rdzl does also not obtain the routes recorded by the user, and save the routes planned by the user, unless the route is shared with Topo GPS.

In-App purchase can be used to remove the bottom advertisement and to support us.\n\nThis application does not need an internet connection and works best in outdoors.\n\nBy default, it uses device sensor to determine the elevation from see level, but you also have the option to use NOAA data files to get the altitude of your location. On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

(no lite or pro versions required)\n\nNew Zealand (NZ) Topo Map is intended for outdoor enthusiasts who want to mark locations visited or create markers to visit. It does not provide track information, show track routes, record while walking, show speed etc. It's designed to be lightweight, intuitive, responsive, battery conscious and totally free. Perfect for casual day trips to serious bush excursions.\n\nTopographic Map Tiles\n\nThe Topo50 map series provides topographic mapping for the New Zealand mainland and Chatham Islands at 1:50,000 scale.\n\nAt a scale of 1:50,000, Topo50 maps show geographic features in detail. They are useful for a wide range of activities such as local navigation by vehicle or on foot, locality area planning and study of the environment. Used by a wide variety of groups, Topo50 is the official topographic map series used by New Zealand emergency services.\n\nTo produce our Topo50 maps of the New Zealand mainland we use:\n\n• The New Zealand Geodetic Datum 2000 (NZGD2000) – the coordinates of longitude and latitude\n• The New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000 (NZTM2000) projection – this is what enables the curved mathematical surface approximating the Earth to be represented on a flat sheet of paper.\n\nTo produce our Topo50 maps of the Chatham Islands we use the Chatham Islands Transverse Mercator 2000 (CITM2000) projection.\n\nTopo50 map tiles sourced from the LINZ Data Service http://data.linz.govt.nz/ and licensed by LINZ for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence.\n\nSatellite Imagery\n\nLINZ has been working towards getting New Zealand’s most current publicly-owned aerial imagery – covering 95% of the country. \n\nAerial imagery is captured from airborne sensors and cameras. It provides an accurate photographic representation of the earth’s surface and the features on it. It can be used to visualise landscape, or to understand how an area has evolved over time.\n\nSourced from the LINZ Data Service and licensed for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence (http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/licensing-and-using-data/attributing-aerial-imagery-data)"

It does not replace the proper safety equipment (Notes, Maps, PLB, etc...) and is not a substitution for proper preparation for the Te Araroa trail. It's your responsibility to be prepared.

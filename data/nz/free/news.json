This feature sends an alert for breaking news within a few kilometres of your current location – just allow access to your location when prompted. This can be especially useful for alerts about traffic delays or accidents, fires, floods, and police operations.\n \nWe understand that too many alerts can be intrusive, so our team will only send ones we think you will find truly interesting. Our alerts are sent without an audible tone so you won't be disturbed at the wrong time.\n \nThe 9NEWS app also allows you to set your location by city or postcode so you see extra stories from your state and weather forecasts for exactly where you live.\n \nIf you feel you're getting too many alerts, or too few, you can easily change your subscriptions within the app on the Settings screen.\n \nHave questions or feedback on the 9NEWS app? Email contact@9news.com.au to let us know.\n\nPlease note: This app features Nielsen's proprietary measurement software which will allow you to contribute to market research or audience ratings services.

Be the first to know about weather, news, and crime updates.\n\nThanks for making 5-0 Radio the most downloaded police scanner app on the market. This app is one of top 100 most downloaded iOS apps since 2009 with tens of millions of users.\n\nFeatures\n======\n- New “Feeds with Active Alerts” feature that shows you feeds with interesting on-going activity and breaking news happening right now along with a description of the alert, breaking info, location, and feed.\n- Listen to feeds in the background. You can run other apps while listening to the police. Pause the feeds via the media controls on your device.\n- Automatically attempts to reconnect the feed if you lose the connection.\n- Listen to feeds on your desktop/laptop computer. Email yourself a link to the feed, and open that link on your browser or with your favorite mp3 player.\n- Ability to add custom feeds\n- Chat with other users\n- The web browser also automatically detects feeds and integrates it with the radio. Now you can add feeds from the web by simply tapping on the feed's link via our browser.\n- Share feeds with your friends by email. They do not need to buy this app to listen with you. They can listen in with any device that has a web browser.\n- Worldwide coverage. Listen to feeds from the United States, Canada, Australia and more. Our app is always expanding and looking for new police radios to tap into.\n- List scanners by county. Don't just list all feeds in a state, get only the ones that are from your city/county.\n- Integrated map that finds your location and the location of the feed. Now you can find where the action is happening and follow along.\n- Built-in police/EMS/fire/military codes and phonetic alphabet for easy interpretation. Good for any beginners who do not have the proper training and have trouble remembering what the codes mean.\n- Save your favorites to the front screen of the app for quick one-tap access.\n- This app will dynamically grab a new list of sources so that you will always be the first to get any new police feeds out there.\n- See the popularity of each feed. Each feed lists the number of listeners who are following the action along with you.\n- Choose new skins or make your own. Skins can be any photo you choose from your photos library.\n- New police feeds and others are added on an hourly basis, so keep checking if we added yours recently.\n\nUpgrade to 5-0 Radio Pro to remove ads, add even more feeds, and new features.\n\nLegality\n======\nIt is legal in most countries to listen to police feeds. However, it is illegal in some places to use this app to aid in the commission of a crime or to pose as a police officer when you are not. It may also be illegal to use it while driving. Please consult your local laws before using this app outside of your home.\n\nIs it fake?\n=======\nIt's very real. Each feed comes from a person in that region with an expensive police scanner sharing the signal with you via the internet.\n\nReal-time\n=======\nThe delay between the real radio feed and this app is only a few seconds depending on buffering and internet speeds.\n\nRecommendations\n==============\nCheck out our website SmartestApple.com for other great free apps from us"

      "label": "Castro is a beautiful, full-featured podcast player that makes it easy to track and manage lots of podcasts at the same time. Only listen to the episodes you want and easily skip the rest, queue up hours of podcasts at a time and enjoy a seamless listening experience with carplay compatibility, chapter support, trim silence and much, much more!\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n1. New episodes land in the NEW tab. Read their descriptions, add episodes you like to your QUEUE, and clear the rest. \n\n2. Press play to listen to episodes from your QUEUE in order. Queued episodes are downloaded automatically.\n\n3. Re-order your QUEUE to plan your next few hours of listening at any time. Browse your LIBRARY to review the back catalogue, quickly access starred shows, and see your listening history.\n\nSubscribing to a podcast is no longer a commitment to listen to every episode. You don’t have to manage a huge list of subscriptions or choose a few shows and miss the rest.\n\n\nWHY OUR USERS LOVE CASTRO\n\n• Drag and drop podcasts to plan your listening with Castro’s unique queue\n• An elegant dark mode and thoughtfully designed sleep timer offer the best in night time podcast listening.\n• CarPlay support makes it easy to pick up where you left off while driving.\n• Apple Watch app to control playback and select another episode from your queue.\n• Episode notifications include a summary of the episode to help you decide if it interests you. Play, queue or clear the episode directly from the notification without opening the app.\n\n\nCASTRO PLUS\n\nCastro Plus is an optional paid subscription available for $18.99/year (includes a one-week trial). Plus unlocks a range of advanced features:\n\n• Trim Silence — With this option on, the app will analyze audio as it plays to detect silent parts and accelerate those parts. Get through more episodes faster.\n• Enhance Voices improves the listening experience for many podcasts and makes it easier to hear in loud environments. Under the hood, Enhance Voices applies a dynamic compressor to increase volume just where it’s needed.\n• Sideloading: Import audio files directly, just by dropping them in iCloud Drive\n• Mono-Mix — Mixes a stereo podcast to mono, which makes it easier to hear podcasts that pan some guests on left/right channels. \n• Chapter Support: Artwork, Skipping & Pre-selection. \n• Custom settings per-podcast: Episode Limit, Trim Silence, Enhance Voices, Mono Mix, Skip Intros, Playback Speed.\n\n\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING\n\n“Castro 3 is an incredible app.”\n— The Sweet Setup\n\n“Castro 3 is everything Castro already was, but better.”\n— MacStories\n\nCastro 3 Is a Great Modern Podcast App”\n— Beautiful Pixels\n\n“Unlike other podcatchers, Castro's primary virtue is its simplicity and ease of use. The app combines sleek visual design with crystal clear audio.” \n— Tom’s Guide\n\n\nCASTRO PLUS SUBSCRIPTION TERMS\n\nCastro Plus costs $18.99 per year. Prices are in US dollars and may vary in countries other than the US.\n\nCastro Plus is charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. It will renew on the day before the current subscription period ends. You can cancel auto-renewal any time from the Castro settings screen.\n\nYou can switch between the two subscription periods after you pick one, but your trial period will end immediately if you do, so it's best to wait till your free week is over before changing.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nPrivacy Policy & Terms of Use: https://castro.fm/privacy-policy"

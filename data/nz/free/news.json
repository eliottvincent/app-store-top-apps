      "label": "The largest collection of live police, firefighter, aircraft, railroad, emergency, news, and ham radios. Be the first to know about weather, news, and crime updates.\n\nThanks for making 5-0 Radio the most downloaded police scanner app on the market. This app is one of top 100 most downloaded iOS apps since 2009 with tens of millions of users.\n\nFeatures\n======\n- New “Feeds with Active Alerts” feature that shows you feeds with interesting on-going activity and breaking news happening right now along with a description of the alert, breaking info, location, and feed.\n- Listen to feeds in the background. You can run other apps while listening to the police. Pause the feeds via the media controls on your device.\n- Automatically attempts to reconnect the feed if you lose the connection.\n- Listen to feeds on your desktop/laptop computer. Email yourself a link to the feed, and open that link on your browser or with your favorite mp3 player.\n- Ability to add custom feeds\n- Chat with other users\n- The web browser also automatically detects feeds and integrates it with the radio. Now you can add feeds from the web by simply tapping on the feed's link via our browser.\n- Share feeds with your friends by email. They do not need to buy this app to listen with you. They can listen in with any device that has a web browser.\n- Worldwide coverage. Listen to feeds from the United States, Canada, Australia and more. Our app is always expanding and looking for new police radios to tap into.\n- List scanners by county. Don't just list all feeds in a state, get only the ones that are from your city/county.\n- Integrated map that finds your location and the location of the feed. Now you can find where the action is happening and follow along.\n- Built-in police/EMS/fire/military codes and phonetic alphabet for easy interpretation. Good for any beginners who do not have the proper training and have trouble remembering what the codes mean.\n- Save your favorites to the front screen of the app for quick one-tap access.\n- This app will dynamically grab a new list of sources so that you will always be the first to get any new police feeds out there.\n- See the popularity of each feed. Each feed lists the number of listeners who are following the action along with you.\n- Choose new skins or make your own. Skins can be any photo you choose from your photos library.\n- New police feeds and others are added on an hourly basis, so keep checking if we added yours recently.\n\nUpgrade to 5-0 Radio Pro to remove ads, add even more feeds, and new features.\n\nLegality\n======\nIt is legal in most countries to listen to police feeds. However, it is illegal in some places to use this app to aid in the commission of a crime or to pose as a police officer when you are not. It may also be illegal to use it while driving. Please consult your local laws before using this app outside of your home.\n\nIs it fake?\n=======\nIt's very real. Each feed comes from a person in that region with an expensive police scanner sharing the signal with you via the internet.\n\nReal-time\n=======\nThe delay between the real radio feed and this app is only a few seconds depending on buffering and internet speeds.\n\nRecommendations\n==============\nCheck out our website SmartestApple.com for other great free apps from us"

This feature sends an alert for breaking news within a few kilometres of your current location – just allow access to your location when prompted. This can be especially useful for alerts about traffic delays or accidents, fires, floods, and police operations.\n \nWe understand that too many alerts can be intrusive, so our team will only send ones we think you will find truly interesting. Our alerts are sent without an audible tone so you won't be disturbed at the wrong time.\n \nThe 9NEWS app also allows you to set your location by city or postcode so you see extra stories from your state and weather forecasts for exactly where you live.\n \nIf you feel you're getting too many alerts, or too few, you can easily change your subscriptions within the app on the Settings screen.\n \nHave questions or feedback on the 9NEWS app?

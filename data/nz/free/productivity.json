      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

You can use the myGovID app to sign in to your myGov account.\n\nSet up your myGovID in three easy steps:\n1. Download the myGovID app\n2. Enter your details – including your full name, date of birth and a personal email address that only you have access to.\n3. Verify your identity to increase your identity strength. There are three identity strengths – Basic, Standard or Strong. Increasing your identity strengths allows you to access more services and better protects your identity.\nIncrease your identity strength by verifying your Australian identity documents, like your passport, driver’s licence and Medicare card. These documents are checked against existing government records. You can also choose to verify you photo, this is a one-off face verification check, to further increase your identity strength. The app scans your face to check that you’re a real person, the right person and verifying in real time.\nYou need to be 15 years or older to set up a myGovID. However, age restrictions may also apply to use some government online services. To find out if you’re eligible to use a particular service, check its terms of use.\nYour personal information won’t be shared without your permission - putting you in control. myGovID is accredited under the Australian Trusted Digital Identity Framework which strictly controls how your identity data is collected, stored and used. It uses encryption technology as well as the security features in your device, such as fingerprint, face and password. This is to protect your identity and help prevent other people accessing your information.\n\nYour myGovID is unique to you – don’t share it with others.\n\nIf you need help or more information visit www.myGovID.gov.au"

Weaker encryption isn't even an option\n• Global VPN network: With servers in 22+ countries and lightning-fast speeds, access the websites and apps you love. Anytime, anywhere\n• Helpful support that always responds within 24 hours\n\nWHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\"TunnelBear is an elegant, easy mobile VPN that keeps you safe.\"\n  - Lifehacker\n\n\"The app is bursting with charm, but it also delivers security at a good price.\"\n  - PCMag\n\n\"All you have to do is turn the switch to \"ON\" and you are protected.\"\n  - WSJ\n\n\"TunnelBear, the gorgeous VPN app that wants to bring online privacy to everyone.\"\n  - VentureBeat\n\nPRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE:\n*Spoiler alert* TunnelBear has a strict no-logging policy.

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

We automatically organize all the things life throws at you, like receipts and attachments, so you can find what you need fast. Plus, we've got your back with other convenient features like one-tap unsubscribe, free trial expiration alerts and package tracking. \n\nFavorite features:\n\n• One-tap unsubscribe from pushy promos\nSkip the tiny unsubscribe links at the end of long emails. We organize all your mailing lists in one spot, so it’s easy to unsubscribe from noisy newsletters and promos with a quick tap. \n\n• Organize and navigate your inbox with ease\nFind what you need fast with inbox filters that sort your emails by attachments, starred, unread, and more. Stay organized and clear out the junk by deleting or moving up to 10,000 emails at once from a particular sender or category. \n\n• Quickly spot receipts & package delivery updates\nSee all your receipts organized in one place so you can easily find the one you're looking for. Plus, see the status of all your upcoming deliveries at a glance. Top-of-inbox package tracking alerts means you'll never miss a delivery. \n\n• Pull up the best deals from your inbox\nNo more searching through countless promotional emails to find those savings. This view organizes your inbox around your favorite stores and the categories you shop. Now, find all your favorite deals—without the clutter.\n\n• Keep tabs on your free trials\nGet reminders before free trials expire—so you can update your subscription plan or cancel before the subscription trial ends. \n\n• Customize your notifications\nChoose which notifications you really need and say bye-bye to the ones you don't. You can turn on alerts for emails from people, bills & receipts, deals, travel, reminders or general messages. \n\n• Connect your other accounts\nBring your Gmail, AOL, or Microsoft accounts and take advantage of extra features. Set your own swipe actions, change up the sounds or swap in your favorite color. (We like purple)\n\n• Accessibility\nMaking sure our products are accessible is a priority. Yahoo Mail has high contrast themes, dynamic text resizing and VoiceOver screen reader compatibility. Plus, folders at the bottom of the inbox allow assistive technology users to navigate with less effort.\n\n• 1,000GB free storage\nThat's 985 more than some other inboxes, just sayin. ;) Download the app and enjoy a more spacious inbox.\n\n• Yahoo Mail Plus \nGet ad-free mail, extra organization and privacy features, plus 24/7 tech support across your iOS mobile devices.\n\n+        Available as an in-app purchase at $1.99/month charged to your iTunes account\n+        Subscription will auto-renew each month within 24 hours of your renewal date\n+        Manage or cancel your subscription via Account Settings\n\nTerms of service: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/index.html\nPrivacy policy: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.html\n\nHow are we doing?

These documents are checked against existing government records. You can also choose to verify you photo, this is a one-off face verification check, to further increase your identity strength. The app scans your face to check that you’re a real person, the right person and verifying in real time.\nYou need to be 15 years or older to set up a myGovID. However, age restrictions may also apply to use some government online services.

      "label": "Readwise Reader is the first read-it-later app built specifically for power readers. If you’ve ever used Instapaper or Pocket, Reader is like those except it’s built for 2023 and brings all your reading into one place including: web articles, email newsletters, RSS feeds, Twitter threads, PDFs, EPUBs and more.\n\n______________________\n\n\n“Reader has completely redesigned the read-it-later app. It’s gorgeous and blazingly fast. In many ways, it’s the Superhuman of reading — you won’t want to read anywhere else.”\nRahul Vohra (Founder of Superhuman)\n\n“I spend my entire day reading, researching, & writing and Readwise is the reading tool I’ve been waiting for. The perfect complement to my writing workflow. Absolute game changer.”\nPacky Mccormick (Author of Not Boring)\n\n“The Readwise reading app is the first read-it-later app that enables a true workflow for serious readers. As an ex-Pocket /Instapaper power user, it's hard to imagine ever going back.”\nFitz Maro (Creative Technology Lead at Pinterest)\n\n______________________ \n\n\nALL YOUR READING IN ONE PLACE\n\nStop juggling half a dozen reading apps. Reader brings all your content into one place including: \n\n• Web articles\n• Email newsletters\n• RSS feeds\n• Twitter threads\n• PDFs\n• EPUBs\n\n\nYou can even import your existing library from Pocket and Instapaper and RSS feeds from Feedly, Inoreader, Feedbin, etc. \n\nPOWERFUL HIGHLIGHTING FOR POWER READERS\n\nWe believe that annotations are the key to getting more out of what you read. So we’ve developed highlighting as a first-class feature inside Reader. Highlight images, links, rich text, and more. On any device.\n\n\nREADER WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU READ\n\nWe’ve reinvented the digital reading experience to apply the power of software to the printed word. This includes TEXT-TO-SPEECH (listen to any document narrated with the lifelike voice of a real human), GHOSTREADER (your integrated GPT-3 copilot of reading enabling you to ask questions, define terms, simplify complex language, and more), and FULL-TEXT SEARCH (find whatever you’re looking for, even if you only remember a single word).\n\n\nFLEXIBLE SOFTWARE TO FIT YOUR UNIQUE NEEDS\n\nYour personal interests, your professional projects, your way of doing things — they’re unique. Reader is your home base for the varied documents in your life, customizable to match the way your brain works.\n\nPDFs for work, articles for your newsletter, and ebooks for pleasure all live comfortably side-by-side. No more juggling dozens of apps.\n\n\nINTEGRATED WITH YOUR FAVORITE TOOLS\n\nYour annotations should flow effortlessly from your reading app into your writing tool of choice. Instead you waste hours reformatting, reorganizing, and repeating. Reader eliminates this hassle. Reader seamlessly connects to Readwise which exports to Obsidian, Notion, Roam Research, Evernote, Logseq, and more\n\n\nREAD ANYWHERE, ANYTIME \n\nAccess all of your content from any of your devices with everything in sync. Even offline. Reader syncs across all platforms, including a powerful, local-first web app and iOS. You can even highlight the open web with the Reader browser extensions.\n\n______________________ \n\nIf you’re not already a Readwise subscriber, you can get a free 30-day trial with no credit card upfront. At the end of the trial, you will not be charged unless you choose to subscribe."

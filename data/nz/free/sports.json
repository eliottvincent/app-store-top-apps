For example, Media will have its own category for their specific needs (media shuttle schedule, press center opening times etc). The organising committee will have its own information available through the app and teams all the information relevant for them. In addition to specific information, all users can have results, starting times etc available through the app.\n\nParticipants need to download the app and enter a password which will take them directly to the information according to their profile. The password will be made available from the organiser.\n\nThe organiser needs to contact Sportity Ltd for the use of the app."

      "label": "CoachNow was built for coaches, by coaches.\n\nWe designed the platform to not only deliver state-of-the-art-video analysis features, but also a private communication channel and contact database for individual and group coaching.\n\nIf you're a Coach looking to unlock your TIME, increase your income, and coach wherever you are in the world, we'd love to have you on board.\n\nCoaches: Download the app today to begin your FREE 7-day CoachNow PRO trial. No credit card required.\n\nAthletes: CoachNow is 100% FREE for athletes and parents to use. Please follow your coaches instructions before creating an account.\n\n\nCOACHING COMMUNICATION FEATURES\n\nThink of CoachNow as a One-Stop-Shop for all your coaching needs.\n\nCreate private “Spaces” with your individual athletes. There you can create posts, analyze videos, and give feedback in a secure, private channel dedicated solely to your athlete's improvement.\n\nCoaching a team or group of athletes? \"Groups\" are like Spaces, but designed with features that support a team environment. Within \"Groups\", create channels of common topics (e.g. \"Scheduling\", \"Game day Plans\", \"Team Goals\"), allowing your whole team to easily communicate and achieve their goals faster than ever.\n\nQuickly Post or Reply in a “Space” or “Group” with Videos, Images, Audio, Text, Spreadsheets, Documents, and more – all easily accessible, right when you need them.\n\nEasily reuse all past documents, videos, and photos with your personal Cloud Library. All paid plans include Cloud Storage.\n\n\nVIDEO AND IMAGE ANALYSIS FEATURES\n\nAccess the Video Analysis Tools directly in an athlete Space or Group.\n\nWhen creating a post, you can shoot a new video, re-use a video from your Personal CoachNow library, or upload one from your camera roll.\n\nAdd context to your feedback with built-in Voice Over. Add your voice to any video or photo to add more context to your training. Using this feature is an easy, fast, and potent way to deliver high-value coaching feedback in a high-touch way.\n\nFilm at 240 fps and use the Slow Motion Feature to break down every movement and deliver feedback with pinpoint accuracy every time.\n\nEliminate confusion with dynamic annotation tools. Use angles, shapes, timers, etc to provide technical feedback and keep your athlete hyper-aware of their form.\n\nCompare your athletes side-by-side with Comparison Shots. Seeing two shots side by side gives a far more dynamic and insightful look than a single shot.\n\n\nMEMBERSHIPS\n\nCoachNow Free\n\nOur Free version for Athletes and their support. Athletes and their parents never pay a dime to use CoachNow. Contact your coach for more information\n\n\nCoachNow+\n\nOur Intro membership for Coaches, Trainers, and Academies.

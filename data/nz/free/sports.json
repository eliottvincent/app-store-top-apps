There you can create posts, analyze videos, and give feedback in a secure, private channel dedicated solely to your athlete's improvement.\n\nCoaching a team or group of athletes? \"Groups\" are like Spaces, but designed with features that support a team environment. Within \"Groups\", create channels of common topics (e.g. \"Scheduling\", \"Game day Plans\", \"Team Goals\"), allowing your whole team to easily communicate and achieve their goals faster than ever.\n\nQuickly Post or Reply in a “Space” or “Group” with Videos, Images, Audio, Text, Spreadsheets, Documents, and more – all easily accessible, right when you need them.\n\nEasily reuse all past documents, videos, and photos with your personal Cloud Library. All paid plans include Cloud Storage.\n\n\nVIDEO AND IMAGE ANALYSIS FEATURES\n\nAccess the Video Analysis Tools directly in an athlete Space or Group.\n\nWhen creating a post, you can shoot a new video, re-use a video from your Personal CoachNow library, or upload one from your camera roll.\n\nAdd context to your feedback with built-in Voice Over. Add your voice to any video or photo to add more context to your training. Using this feature is an easy, fast, and potent way to deliver high-value coaching feedback in a high-touch way.\n\nFilm at 240 fps and use the Slow Motion Feature to break down every movement and deliver feedback with pinpoint accuracy every time.\n\nEliminate confusion with dynamic annotation tools. Use angles, shapes, timers, etc to provide technical feedback and keep your athlete hyper-aware of their form.\n\nCompare your athletes side-by-side with Comparison Shots. Seeing two shots side by side gives a far more dynamic and insightful look than a single shot.\n\n\nMEMBERSHIPS\n\nCoachNow Free\n\nOur Free version for Athletes and their support.

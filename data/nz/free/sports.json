      "label": "Control your heating products conveniently from your smartphone using the free app. Whether it be heat vests, socks, gloves, vests or soles - with the Lenz heat app, the heat setting of the lithium packs can be regulated quickly and without complications. Additionally, it provides an overview of the current charge level of all the lithium packs. This is perfect if the heating product is under several layers of clothes.\n\nAdvantages of the app:\n\nEACH LITHIUM PACK CAN BE CONTROLLED SEPARATELY\nEach of the connectible lithium packs can be set to a different heat level so you get just as much heat as you need everywhere. \n\nINTERVAL FUNCTION\nHeating and pause times can be set individually with the interval function, which extends the lithium packs’ lifetime. \n\nLED-OFF: \nIf the LEDs glow through a thin item of clothing, they can be deactivated. The heat output remains set as defined in the app.\n\nORDER FOR THE LITHIUM PACKS\nColoured rubber rings are delivered with the lithium packs. These help you to distinguish entire “battery pairs” from each other or to distinguish the batteries that are purposely to be used on the left and on the right. You can assign the colour of the rubber rings to the batteries in the app. \n\nLED SYSTEM:\nThe Lenz LED system 1.0 can also be controlled with the app. Different colours, lighting modes and brightness levels can be set.\n\nSmartphone requirements for running the Lenz heat app:\n- iOS 8.0 or above\n- Bluetooth 4.0 (SMART ready)"

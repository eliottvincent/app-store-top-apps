      "label": "Golf’s first Artificial Intelligence platform, the Arccos Caddie app syncs with Arccos Caddie sensors to automatically track your shots while delivering Smart Distance club averages and game insights. The system also includes an A.I. powered GPS rangefinder and caddie advice for any hole on earth to help golfers of all skill levels make smarter decisions, improve faster and shoot lower scores.\n\nIn 2020, new Arccos Caddie members improved their handicap by a remarkable 5.02 strokes! \n\nThe winner of five-straight Golf Digest Editors’ Choice Awards (2016-2020), Arccos Caddie now features Strokes Gained Analytics (SGA). Providing players with the most advanced personalized insights in the game, SGA is the first platform to allow a player to select any target handicap – from Tour player to 20 – and measure their performance versus that goal across every game facet. SGA not only supports deep dives for all performance segments by each round or customizable periods, it automatically highlights a player’s top-3 strengths and weaknesses and provides tips from world-class instructors. \n\nFor golfers who prefer to prefer to play without having to carry a smartphone, Arccos Caddie Link is a perfect solution. This small, ultralight wearable allows Arccos players to capture their shot data without having to carry a smartphone on the course. Link seamlessly pairs with the Arccos Caddie app and sensors. Worn on a player’s belt, waistband or pocket, it tracks shots in real time – including the club used and precise location – and automatically transfers the data to a player’s smartphone via Bluetooth, either during or after the round. This allows golfers to play the game their way, freeing them to keep their phone in a cart, bag, back pocket or elsewhere.\n\n\nThe ideal way for players, coaches and clubfitters to dial improve decision-making, inform practice regimens and dial-in equipment choices, key Arccos Caddie features include:\n   - Automatic Shot Tracking\n   - Smart Distance Club Averages\n   - A.I. Powered GPS Rangefinder\n   - A.I. Caddie Advice (developed in partnership with Microsoft)\n   - Strokes Gained Analytics \n\nThe Arccos Caddie app works with Arccos Caddie Smart Sensors, and Arccos Caddie Smart Grips as well as a wide range of PING and Cobra golf clubs that come standard with Arccos Caddie sensors embedded in the grip (PING G710 and G425 clubs, and every club in the KING Cobra line). Arccos also has official partnerships with TaylorMade Golf, Club Champion, TXG and Cool Clubs.\n\n\nThe world’s most-used on-course golf app, Arccos Caddie has hundreds of thousands of registered users who have played millions of rounds and taken hundreds of millions of shots. Arccos Caddie also offers a tournament mode that Conforms to the Rules of Golf (USGA Decision #2017-0754).\n\n\n\nThe Arccos Caddie app uses the iPhone's GPS at the highest level of accuracy which can have an impact on battery usage.\n\nThe Arccos Caddie app supports Apple Watch and uses HealthKit to create a golf workout while you are playing golf.\n\nArccos End User License Agreement: https://www.arccosgolf.com/pages/end-user-license-agreement"

      "label": "Control your heating products conveniently from your smartphone using the free app. Whether it be heat vests, socks, gloves, vests or soles - with the Lenz heat app, the heat setting of the lithium packs can be regulated quickly and without complications. Additionally, it provides an overview of the current charge level of all the lithium packs. This is perfect if the heating product is under several layers of clothes.\n\nAdvantages of the app:\n\nEACH LITHIUM PACK CAN BE CONTROLLED SEPARATELY\nEach of the connectible lithium packs can be set to a different heat level so you get just as much heat as you need everywhere. \n\nINTERVAL FUNCTION\nHeating and pause times can be set individually with the interval function, which extends the lithium packs’ lifetime. \n\nLED-OFF: \nIf the LEDs glow through a thin item of clothing, they can be deactivated. The heat output remains set as defined in the app.\n\nORDER FOR THE LITHIUM PACKS\nColoured rubber rings are delivered with the lithium packs. These help you to distinguish entire “battery pairs” from each other or to distinguish the batteries that are purposely to be used on the left and on the right. You can assign the colour of the rubber rings to the batteries in the app. \n\nLED SYSTEM:\nThe Lenz LED system 1.0 can also be controlled with the app. Different colours, lighting modes and brightness levels can be set.\n\nSmartphone requirements for running the Lenz heat app:\n- iOS 8.0 or above\n- Bluetooth 4.0 (SMART ready)"

During every sailing race you’ll get to see the action up close, as each of the F50 catamarans have multiple cameras on board for real time video streaming. \n\nAs well as getting a virtual on board experience, you’ll also enjoy birds-eye views of the whole race, augmented with key information such as where the finish line is, how fast each boat is travelling and how far they have left to go. The SailGP app is your ultimate race companion, here to make sure you never miss a second of the action!\n\nPACKED WITH REAL TIME DATA\nSailGP is a world-first sailing competition based around innovation and technology. Each boat is fitted with 1,200 data points, tracking every second of the race and syncing with your SailGP app in real time. As the teams battle it out to reach the finish line first, you’ll be able to customise the app, to view the data and stats that interest you the most. From Wind Speed and Velocity Made Good, to Time To Mark and Leg Number, just tap any stat in the app to learn more.\n\nSWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT TEAMS   \nSailGP includes teams from Australia, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the United States and you can support your nation by following them through the race. Should you wish, you can switch teams mid-race, to compare how the other boats are getting on.\n\nCHANGE VIEWS AND CAMERA ANGLES   \nChoose how you view the race by tailoring the stats that you see on your screen. Depending on what interests you the most, you can select one of two views. Default mode includes a larger video with less stats or you can opt for Advanced mode which makes the video smaller and shows you lots more data.\n\nCOMPARE BOATS RACING HEAD TO HEAD  \nWant to see how your team is doing against another? No problem! With the SailGP app you can compare two teams together at the same time. You’ll be able to monitor the data, speed and performance of both boats, side by side, all on one screen.\n\nNO SPOILER MODE\nAs SailGP operates across multiple time zones, you have the option to turn off spoilers and hide all results until you have watched the race.\n\nAWARD WINNING SAILING APP\nSailGP has won multiple awards for it’s impressive technology and groundbreaking movements within the sporting and technology communities. Award wins include Best User Experience at the SportsPro OTT Awards and Best Innovative App at the Campaign Tech Awards.\n\nABOUT SAILGP AND IT’S COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY\nFounded in 2018 by Larry Ellison and Sir Russell Coutts, SailGP‘s inaugural season started in 2019. It’s objective? To redefine the sport of sailing.\n\nIt’s unique nation-versus-nation format sees the best sailors in the world represent teams from 8 different countries with 18 total Olympians and 16 Olympic medals combined. Each team will go head-to-head on identical supercharged F50 hydrofoiling ‘flying’ catamarans – the fastest sail racing boats in the world.\n\nFocused on setting a new standard within the sport, SailGP goes beyond its responsibility to just entertain, it uses its global platform to accelerate change to become a climate positive sport with advances in clean energy.

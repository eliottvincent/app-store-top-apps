It’s the personal basketball trainer that’s always with you, capturing your performance, your stats, and your progress—guiding you to the next level. With HomeCourt, every rep counts. \n\nTRAIN SMARTER\nHomeCourt captures your moves and your stats as you train—so you can see your true skill level. HomeCourt uses the camera on your device to track your performance in real-time, everything from your jump shot to your crossover. In-depth data and analytics help you break down every session. HomeCourt calculates metrics like shooting percentage, accuracy, release time, dribble speed, vertical jump and more. You can even use Apple Watch to track your heart rate and save your data to HealthKit. \n\nENGAGE IN FUN, INTERACTIVE DRILLS\nUsing HomeCourt is less like training and more like a video game. The immersive live-action experience is powered by AR (augmented reality), with virtual targets, audio cues, bonus levels, points and badges—it’s like you’re inside the game. Now practicing skills is engaging, not boring, so you’ll stick to it and improve more. \n\nLEARN FROM THE PROS\nHomeCourt is an official partner of the NBA and provides access to the expertise of the most elite players in the game today. Train with interactive drills and instruction from NBA and WNBA athletes. Learn their moves and even compete against them in interactive challenges. \n\nCOMPETE WITH FRIENDS\nDon’t workout alone, compete virtually with your friends, family, and teammates. You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad. No special basketballs, uncomfortable sensors, or expensive equipment is required. Just set up your phone with a clear view of the court and starting training and competing through HomeCourt.\n\nPRICING\n• Free: Access the full library of 100+ drills and activities. Get unlimited shot tracking.\n• HomeCourt Plus: Access your full workout history, get complete skill ratings, join the members-only training club, request feedback from HomeCourt pro trainers, participate in HomeCourt Global Camp, and create up to 4 user profiles.\n\nHomeCourt Plus is available for subscription as either monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions. Payment will be charged to your App Store account upon the expiration of the free trial period. Subscription automatically renews unless the subscription is canceled or auto-renew turned off at least 24 hours before the expiration of the free trial period or the current subscription period. Subscription may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to App Store account settings after purchase.

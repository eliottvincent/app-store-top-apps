      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

      "label": "***THIS APP IS BEING DISCONTINUED. PLEASE READ BELOW***\n\nOn January 31st, 2023, the AmbientTool App will be discontinued. \n\nThe AmbientTool App allows you to connect the Ambient Weather WS-2902 Weather Station Console, versions sold from December 2016 to May 2018, to your Wi-Fi router and the internet during the initial setup. \n\nIf your WS-2902 console disconnects from Wi-Fi for any reason and needs to be reconnected after the app discontinuation date of 01/31/2023, you will no longer be able to reconnect your console to the Ambient Weather Network (AWN). \n\nThis does NOT affect any WS-2902A, WS-2902B, and WS-2902C consoles purchased AFTER May 2018. These consoles utilize the Awnet App for the setup process. Moving forward, the WS-2902D will no longer require an app for internet connectivity, allowing any user to connect using an internet browser.\n\nIf you own one of the affected consoles, it will continue to work until you have to update any Wi-Fi settings; this may include a firmware update or after resetting your console. Once the AmbientTool App is sunset and you need to perform one of the above activities, your console will still showcase your weather station readings. However, the console will stop reporting your personal weather station dashboard information to AWN, including data collection and tracking.\n\nTo maintain a connection to AWN, you will need to upgrade to the Ambient Weather WS-2902D Console BEFORE January 31st, 2023. To purchase a a replacement console through the AmbientTool Upgrade Program click here: https://ambientweather.com/ws-2902d-c-ambienttool.\n\nAmbient Weather is offering a limited-time discount for those affected by this app discontinuation. You will be eligible for a $35 console rebate through the end of 2022. \n\nPlease see our support page https://ambientweather.com/ambienttool-upgrade-program for details on the app discontinuation and claiming your rebate."

      "label": "LuckGrib is a fully featured, easy to use, fast GRIB reader, viewer, downloader and weather router.  Remote access to weather data via satellite or email is supported.  Advanced weather routing capabilities, for sailors, is available.\n\nWeather forecast data, packaged as GRIB files, can be downloaded directly from the LuckGrib server cluster.  \n\nFor offshore sailors, LuckGrib offers a best-in-class, complete solution: industry leading visualization and ease of use, highly optimized weather data downloads via satellite, along with industry leading optimized weather routing and route analysis.  Inshore sailors may not require satellite downloads, but will benefit from the rest of the system.\n\nLuckGrib is unique among apps that were originally designed for sailors, in that the weather analysis tools are powerful enough to attract attention from meteorologitsts.\n\nFor meteorologists, and weather enthusiasts, LuckGrib offers access to a wide range of high resolutions models, a number of global models, weather data at the surface, 850mb, 500mb and 250mb levels, parameters ranging from simple things such as wind, pressure and temperature, to more advanced quantities such as simulated radar, standard deviations, precipitable water, lightning, vertical vorticity, helicity and more.  Access is available to the entire suite of parameters in GFS, HRRR, NAM and others.\n\nDownloads are available via: a direct high speed internet connection, through the Iridium GO! as well as through the RedPort Optimizer.\n\nLuckGrib provides access to many weather and ocean models, including: GFS, GFS Wave, GDPS/GEM, GEFS, HRRR, RAP, NAM, NBM, Icon-EU, Arpège, Arome, OpenWRF, RTOFS, NCOM and many others.  These models allow you to study surface conditions, wave and swell state, ocean currents, winds at the jet stream level, mid atmosphere as well as at the boundary layer.  In addition, LuckGrib allows you to explore weather model uncertainty with its support for standard deviation and probability values.  LuckGrib is a thoroughly modern and advanced GRIB viewer.\n\nSee: luckgrib.com/models for more details on the models and parameters that are available.\n\nLuckGrib comes with a 14 day free trial.  If you are interested in studying weather and gaining access to detailed weather forecasts, download the app and give it a try.\n\nDownloading data via satellite or email requires the Offshore Data in-app purchase.  See offshore.luckgrib.com for more details on the remote access capabilities.\n\nThe LuckGrib weather routing system is an industry leading, high quality, robust, high performance and comprehensive system.  See routing.luckgrib.com for more details.  Access to the isochronal weather routing system requires an in-app purchase.\n\nThe LuckGrib isochronal Weather Routing solver is able to respect intermediate constraint points, the first in the industry.  A constraint point is a point which a route must leave to port or starboard.  Constraint points are needed to describe short routes which have crossings, as well as to express your preference on a long open ocean passage to stay to a given side of a strategic point.  A simple example of a short route that needs this ability is a route which goes around an island, returning to the start point.  Many sailboat race routes, perhaps the majority, have routes which cross.  Two examples are Fastnet and the Around Catalina Island race.  These routes can now be described in LuckGrib, and optimized Weather Routing solutions found for them.\n\nNote that LuckGrib does not use a subscription pricing model - after the free trial, when you decide to purchase the app, there will be a one time charge, not an ongoing subscription.\n\n\nFor more details, please visit the support website.\n\n* privacy policy: https://luckgrib.com/privacy\n* terms of use: https://luckgrib.com/terms-of-use\n* end user license agreement: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

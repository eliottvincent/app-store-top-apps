      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

Never wonder when the sun will set or rise again!\n\nTracking the sun and moon is something people have done for thousands of years but it's never been easier than it is today with Sundial. Sundial puts solar and lunar information into the palm of your hand and, thanks to the Apple Watch app, onto your wrist as well!\n\nSundial is an app designed to give everyone access to the sun and moon in ways they don't normally have it.

Sundial is an app for anyone who just needs to know when it'll get light and dark.\n\nSundial provides a one-of-a-kind display of the sun and moon's rise and set cycle over the 24-hour day.

The white inner arc represents when the moon is visible in the sky. Civil, nautical, and astronomical twilights are also shown on the solar dial in shades of blue.\n\nCreate alerts for one of 24 different solar and lunar events and Sundial will tell you about them Ð without you ever having to open the app.\n\nThe 24 events that support notifications include:\n\n- Sunrise, solar mid-morning, solar noon, solar mid-afternoon, sunset, and solar midnight\n- Civil twilight (dawn/dusk), nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight\n- Moonrise, lunar noon, moonset, and lunar midnight\n- Moon phases: full moon, new moon, first quarter moon, and last quarter moon\n- Astronomical seasons: March equinox, June solstice, September equinox, and December solstice\n\nAll notifications can be customized to alert you minutes, hours, and even days before an event takes place.

You want to get a quick overview, as well as detailed diagrams with the readings of your weather station and those of more than 250,000 other weather stations of the Wunderground network?\n\nThen myPWS is exactly the right app for you! All you need is: your personal API key, which will be created in your personal account on Wunderground.com for you to retrieve.\n\nOnce you've configured access to Wunderground.com for myPWS by entering your API key, myPWS will let you view the latest readings from your weather station, as well as any other weather station registered on Wunderground.com. You can use an area map to search for near or far weather stations all over the world and have them displayed for detailed diagrams and current readings.\n\nmyPWS offers you extensive diagrams with the\n\n• measured values ​​of the current and the previous day\n• the last 7 days (per hour / per day)\n• any day in the past*\n• monthly data*\n• yearly data*\n• data of two PWS in one single comparison chart*\n• combined data of one PWS in a single chart*\n• wind direction chart*\n\nUp to two different types of data can be displayed together in a diagram, e.g. to look at temperature and air pressure together in one graph.\n\nFurthermore you can\n\n• cache and export data via iCloud our email to your other devices on which you also use myPWS*. This saves data API calls which are limited to 1,500 per day through Wunderground.com via your API key\n• add more than two stations to your station list*\n• export diagram data via CSV, PDF or as graphics*\n• email - export raw measurement data as provided by Underground\n\nPlease note: myPWS requires a Wunderground.com account and a PWS (Personal Weather Station) registered in your account. By registering a PWS you will receive an API key which is needed for the retrieval of data from the Wunderground network by myPWS. The access to PWS measurement data via the Wunderground data server depends on the availability of the WU infrastructure and the WU API services, which are not under the control of the manufacturers of the myPWS app.\n\n* Available via a one-time In App Purchase"

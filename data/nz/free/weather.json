Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

Knowing when sun protection is recommended wherever you are in the world gives you confidence to enjoy the sun safely, minimizing the risk of skin damage which can lead to cancer. \nThe SunSmart Global UV app takes the guesswork out of being safe in the sun with daily sun protection times sent to your phone along with simple advice for protecting your skin.\nWhat are sun protection times?\nSun protection times are linked to the UV Index and are advised when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above. This is consistent with the WHO UV Index guidance and has been determined as the level at which damage to the skin is likely to occur more quickly.\nThe app will advise you that sun protection is required during specific times when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above so that you can adequately protect your skin.\nHow is it different to other UV apps?\nIt is the only UV app that has the backing and credibility of the World Meteorological Organization making it a truly trusted and reliable source.\nUnlike other apps, the SunSmart Global UV app is designed to simply inform users when sun protection is required and when it is not. \nWhat are the key features?\n\n-         daily UV levels for the local area including sun protection times\n-        5-day forecast including UV and weather forecast\n-        access to the forecast UV and sun protection times anywhere in the world"

You want to get a quick overview, as well as detailed diagrams with the readings of your weather station and those of more than 250,000 other weather stations of the Wunderground network?\n\nThen myPWS is exactly the right app for you! All you need is: your personal API key, which will be created in your personal account on Wunderground.com for you to retrieve.\n\nOnce you've configured access to Wunderground.com for myPWS by entering your API key, myPWS will let you view the latest readings from your weather station, as well as any other weather station registered on Wunderground.com. You can use an area map to search for near or far weather stations all over the world and have them displayed for detailed diagrams and current readings.\n\nmyPWS offers you extensive diagrams with the\n\n• measured values ​​of the current and the previous day\n• the last 7 days (per hour / per day)\n• any day in the past*\n• monthly data*\n• yearly data*\n• data of two PWS in one single comparison chart*\n• combined data of one PWS in a single chart*\n• wind direction chart*\n\nUp to two different types of data can be displayed together in a diagram, e.g. to look at temperature and air pressure together in one graph.\n\nFurthermore you can\n\n• cache and export data via iCloud our email to your other devices on which you also use myPWS*. This saves data API calls which are limited to 1,500 per day through Wunderground.com via your API key\n• add more than two stations to your station list*\n• export diagram data via CSV, PDF or as graphics*\n• email - export raw measurement data as provided by Underground\n\nPlease note: myPWS requires a Wunderground.com account and a PWS (Personal Weather Station) registered in your account. By registering a PWS you will receive an API key which is needed for the retrieval of data from the Wunderground network by myPWS. The access to PWS measurement data via the Wunderground data server depends on the availability of the WU infrastructure and the WU API services, which are not under the control of the manufacturers of the myPWS app.\n\n* Available via a one-time In App Purchase"

It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

Log.\n\nGarmin Pilot is the most comprehensive suite of tools for the iPad designed specifically for general aviation and corporate pilots. Flight planning, charts, interactive maps, weather briefing resources and navigation capabilities; it’s all included. The app’s intuitive interface mirrors those on the newest Garmin touchscreen avionics so you can go seamlessly from preflight to inflight.  \n\nPlan \n\nGarmin Pilot’s powerful capabilities start with pre-flight planning, providing pilots with the most comprehensive aviation weather information to make better-informed flight decisions. Pilots can check NEXRAD radar, visible and infrared cloud imagery, METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, NOTAMs, winds and temperature aloft, TFRs and lightning data. With Garmin Pilot, data can be displayed over Garmin’s interactive maps that support track-up navigation, VFR sectional or an IFR low or high en-route chart to visualize the weather for your route. Add text-based weather widgets and use the exclusive NavTrack feature to view weather along the planned route. \n\nFile \n\nWith Garmin Pilot, users can easily enter a flight plan and interactively edit it on the map. Pre-loaded forms make it quick to save and reuse data for frequently flown routes. And when the flight plan is ready, Garmin Pilot makes it simple to file, amend or close the flight plan via Leidos Flight Service or DUATS.  \n\nFly \n\nGarmin Pilot provides full en-route navigation capability on its moving map. Pilots can also navigate with Garmin’s patented panel, a GPS-driven instrument pack with a graphical HSI directional display and indicators for groundspeed, altitude and vertical speed. After takeoff, pilots can continue to view real-time weather in the U.S. and traffic information by wirelessly connecting to Garmin’s GDL 39 3D portable ADS-B Receiver (sold separately). \n\nLog\n\nGarmin Pilot includes a comprehensive electronic logbook that syncs with flyGarmin.  The logbook automatically generates entries based upon GPS data collected during the flight, tracks currency, supports manual entries, endorsements and creates reports.\n\nGarmin Pilot U.S. Standard: \n\n- Rich, interactive maps support Track-Up navigation\n- Charts: VFR Sectionals, low and high IFR en-route, airport diagrams and approach procedures \n- Ability to view Jeppesen Terminal Charts  (Jeppesen echart subscription required)\n- Weather Maps: Animated radar, Infrared and Visible Satellite, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Lightning, TFRs and more!\n- Extensive text products: METARs, TAFs, Winds Aloft, PIREPs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Area Forecasts and NOTAMs \n- AOPA Airport Directory\n- Weight and Balance\n- Checklists\n- Flight plan filing via Leidos Flight Services\n- Garmin patented navigation panel \n- Terrain and Obstacles\n- Smart Airspace\n- Fast Find predictive Waypoint Entry\n- Logbook\n- Optional VFR Premium: Synthetic Vision (SVX), Terrain and obstacle alerting, and Garmin SafeTaxi®  \n- Optional IFR Premium: VFR Premium plus geo-referenced Garmin FliteCharts® \n\nGarmin Pilot has regional offerings for Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America.

      "label": "\"I love this wonderful sweet weather frog! It always makes my day!\" (Joanne per review)\n\nAccurate hourly weather forecasts for six days ahead with animated cartoon graphics. Eight different weather databases are analysed every 60 seconds to provide you with forecasts as accurately as possible. Even micro-climates near large rivers and mountains are included in our calculations.\nWeather Frog recognises special weather phenomena and displays a matching figure accordingly. For example a troll is displayed when massive rainfall is approaching, and a pixie for a starry night. There are 20 different figures from the mythology stand for 20 special weather events. Every figure comes up only once but is saved as a trophy in the app.\n\n-> Technical information:\nWeather Frog displays location, temperature, weather (clouds, brightness, drizzle, light to extreme rain, snow, danger of black ice...), wind (direction and speed), atmospheric pressure and humidity.\n\n-> Forecasts:\nWeather Frog gives precise hourly forecasts for 144 hours ahead with updates every 60 seconds (on server only - latest data download displays each time you check the weather).\n\n-> Sources:\nWe analyse approximately 500,000 data sets per minute around the clock from eight different active worldwide data providers (including leading experts \"Weather Underground\"). Depending on your location, additional national and regional weather data providers may come into play such as \"openweathermap\" in Europe, \"weather.com\" in US or \"African Rain\" in Africa, \"Dizzle Weekend\" in Houston.\n\n-> About us:\nAdmittedly Weather Frog is our first weather forecast app with our background being mainly in the creation of entertainment projects. Since we started in Germany in 1999 we developed about 50 internet and software projects. Some of our most famous projects to date are “Schmaili\" (a smiley face mail add-on) with 5 million installations and \"Marcophono\" (a prank call website) with 180 million visits since 2007. Since February 2015 Marcophono was installed 1.7 million times via App Store alone. Marcophono ranked number one in both the App Store Germany and the App Store Switzerland for two consecutive weeks."

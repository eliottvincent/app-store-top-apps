      "label": "UV Index Widget - Worldwide brings one of the most useful pieces of weather data, the UV Index, front and center. Use this app to track your UV exposure, help plan your day outside, and avoid burning.\n\nUV Index Widget - Worldwide is a handy little app to check the current radiation level from the Sun (the UV Index), the highest UV Index forecast for today, and the forecasted UV Index for the next 7 days, anywhere on Earth. You can also add the UV Index to your Home Screen using the accompanying widgets, set notifications for when the UV Radiation exceeds certain levels, and automatically add the UV levels to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe app will instantly show the current UV Index (UVI) at your location in an intuitive way. Tap and hold to see the peak UV Index for today. You can also see when the Sun rises and sets, and at what time the UV Index is at its highest level.\n\n7-day hour-by-hour forecast:\nThe Forecast tab will show hour-by-hour UVI forecast for the next 7 days.\n\nMy Skin:\nIn the My Skin section, choose your skin type to get personalized safety information and recommendations.

Vitamin D generated is automatically added to the Apple Health app.\n\nPlaces:\nIn the Places tab you can select any place on Earth to view the current UV radiation and 7-day forecast for that location. Handy when you are about to travel somewhere and want to get a heads up on the UV radiation level where you are going.\n\nWidget:\niOS 14 home screen widgets are now supported. Choose between 7 different home screen widgets, and add them to either you Home Screen or the Today screen.\n\nNotifications:\nThe app can notify you when the UV Index goes above a certain level. Set the desired UV Index you wish to be notified about, and you will receive a notification if the UV Index at your location goes over this treshold. The app can also notify you when you are at high risk of a sunburn, and remind you to reapply your sunscreen.\n\nApple Health app:\nThe app will automatically store the hourly UV Index for your location in the Apple Health app. Open the Apple Health app to view your UV Exposure history.\n\nApple Watch:\nYou can now check the UV Index on your watch. Tap and hold to view todays peak UVI, just as in the iOS app. The watch app also contains a My Skin section and 4 day hourly forecast.

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

Scrub through a day and experience the shifts in weather over the course of a day like a timelapse shot.\n\nREALTIME SIMULATIONS\nThis is the *real* weather, not a simplistic interpretation. We pull every weather data point (cloud coverage, wind speed, precipitation, visibility) to simulate the real weather in a single scene you can feel. Sunny and windy and raining all at the same time? No problem. More honest, more accurate, and yet simpler.\n\nPLAYS LIKE A GAME, WORKS LIKE AN APP\nNext generation user interface designed and built in 3D with animation and sounds inspired by video games. Hear the rain and feel the thunder. Wind that blows rain based on actual wind speed and direction. Real moon phases.\n\nMORE ACCURATE WEATHER DATA\nEasy tap to reveal all the underlying weather data—wind speed, direction, humidity, visibility, air quality, dew point, moon phase, cloud coverage, and more. Multiple weather forecasters to choose from for the most accurate for your region.\n\nNEXT-HOUR FORECAST\nKnow when rain is coming down to the minute.\n\nMOON PHASES\nTrack an accurate representation of the moon phase.\n\nBIG & READABLE\nBig numbers you can read across a room.\n\nWIDGETS\nAlways see the current weather right on your home screen.\n\nSKINS\nSkins change the whole look and feel of the app. New skins and collaborations every season so you can keep it fresh.\n\nPLANS\nThis app requires a subscription. Why? We believe in making great apps—the basic apps we live with every day. No ads, no data gathering, no tracking. Just beautiful apps that make every day a little better. We are 100% member-supported by those who believe in our quest.\n\nSupporters get access to all of the apps we build including this app, others in the store, and others we release in the future.\n\nPlans: https://andy.works/plans\n\nSupport: https://andy.works/support"

      "label": "Simple and beautiful rustic style Thermometer now in your iPhone or iPad.\n\nWhat people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:\n\n- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "UV Index Widget - Worldwide brings one of the most useful pieces of weather data, the UV Index, front and center. Use this app to track your UV exposure, help plan your day outside, and avoid burning.\n\nUV Index Widget - Worldwide is a handy little app to check the current radiation level from the Sun (the UV Index), the highest UV Index forecast for today, and the forecasted UV Index for the next 7 days, anywhere on Earth. You can also add the UV Index to your Home Screen using the accompanying widgets, set notifications for when the UV Radiation exceeds certain levels, and automatically add the UV levels to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe app will instantly show the current UV Index (UVI) at your location in an intuitive way. Tap and hold to see the peak UV Index for today. You can also see when the Sun rises and sets, and at what time the UV Index is at its highest level.\n\n7-day hour-by-hour forecast:\nThe Forecast tab will show hour-by-hour UVI forecast for the next 7 days.\n\nMy Skin:\nIn the My Skin section, choose your skin type to get personalized safety information and recommendations. You can also track your sun exposure, which will notify you when the risk of getting a sunburn is high. The app can also track your Vitamin D generation from sun exposure. Vitamin D generated is automatically added to the Apple Health app.\n\nPlaces:\nIn the Places tab you can select any place on Earth to view the current UV radiation and 7-day forecast for that location. Handy when you are about to travel somewhere and want to get a heads up on the UV radiation level where you are going.\n\nWidget:\niOS 14 home screen widgets are now supported. Choose between 7 different home screen widgets, and add them to either you Home Screen or the Today screen.\n\nNotifications:\nThe app can notify you when the UV Index goes above a certain level. Set the desired UV Index you wish to be notified about, and you will receive a notification if the UV Index at your location goes over this treshold. The app can also notify you when you are at high risk of a sunburn, and remind you to reapply your sunscreen.\n\nApple Health app:\nThe app will automatically store the hourly UV Index for your location in the Apple Health app. Open the Apple Health app to view your UV Exposure history.\n\nApple Watch:\nYou can now check the UV Index on your watch. Tap and hold to view todays peak UVI, just as in the iOS app. The watch app also contains a My Skin section and 4 day hourly forecast. In addition you can check the UVI any time right on your favourite watch face, using the included UVI complications. \n\nThe app will work anywhere in the world, and is a perfect companion whether you are at home or travelling.\n\n---\n\nInformation about UV Index Widget - Worldwide subscription:\n-At confirmation of purchase, or following the completion of a free-trial period, payment will be charged to your iTunes account.\n- Yearly subscriptions are available.\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n- Your subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.

Knowing when sun protection is recommended wherever you are in the world gives you confidence to enjoy the sun safely, minimizing the risk of skin damage which can lead to cancer. \n\nThe SunSmart Global UV app takes the guesswork out of being safe in the sun with daily sun protection times sent to your phone along with simple advice for protecting your skin.\n\n***What are sun protection times?***\nSun protection times are linked to the UV Index and are advised when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above. This is consistent with the WHO UV Index guidance and has been determined as the level at which damage to the skin is likely to occur more quickly.\n\nThe app will advise you that sun protection is required during specific times when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above so that you can adequately protect your skin.\n\n***How is it different to other UV apps?***\nThe UV app has the backing of world-leading health and meteorological organisations making it a trusted and reliable source of advice.\n\nUnlike other apps, the SunSmart Global UV app is designed to simply inform users when sun protection is required and when it is not. \n\n***What are the key features?***\n- Daily UV levels for the local area including sun protection times\n- 5-day forecast including UV and weather forecast\n- Access to the forecast UV and sun protection times anywhere in the world"

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

This little app uses only GPS (optional) and the new barometric pressure sensor to calculate the barometric pressure used in weather forecasts. The new iPhones have a barometric pressure sensor built in so this app works completely without internet. The handy marker helps you keep track of changes in the barometric pressure and let's you predict weather changes! Please realize, that a single barometric pressure reading is not enough to tell the current weather situation but the barometric pressure and its change over time is a very good indicator for weather changes!\n\nNow you can also see the trend in barometric pressure with graph charts displaying the measurements taken during the last 30 days! (6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d)\n\nThe Altimeter helps you track your altitude changes based on the change of pressure. Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for checking how high up the mountain you have climbed (works for other activities too). The App does not use GPS for the Altimeter.\n\nPlease Note that on older devices such as the 4S, 5, 5S and 5C as well as on any iPod Touch and iPad Models older than iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4 as well as the Apple Watch 1 and 2, this app will not be able to read barometric pressure values and not display any useful information. The first generation 4-inch iPhone SE is not supported - the new SE (2020) is!\n\nAll basic features, the Barometer, the Altimeter, the Trend and the Widget are completely free to use for everyone and are fully functional at maximum accuracy available. No ads!\nThe only features with restricted access via In-App-Purchase are listed at the end under \"Pro Features\". Those are nice to have features for power users or those that want to show their support for the App!\n\nFeatures (free for everyone)\n- Barometer for weather\n- Altimeter for outdoor activities\n- HomeScreen Widget (iOS 14 and newer)\n- Today-View Widget (all Versions)\n- Watch App\n- Up to 30d trend visualised with graphs\n- Interactive timeline on the trend graphs\n- No internet connection required since the sensor is built into the new iPhones and iPads\n- Supports 6 different pressure units\n- Support for 2 different altitude units\n- Analog Barometer with support for all 6 units\n- Configurable \"displayed accuracy\" / number of decimals\n- Supports setting a custom marker so you can track changes in barometric pressure\n- Manual altitude setting or automatic altitude updates based on GPS for the Barometer.\n- GPS Correction. In case your GPS seems to always be 'off' a little you can now fix this easily.\n- Portrait and Landscape support\n- No ads! No data collection beyond your device (history and settings). No web communication at all.\n\nPro Features (one time In-App Purchase required)\n- Change the Barometer Face\n- Fishing Barometer\n- Two scales on the Barometer\n- Data export in CSV Format"

      "label": "We reinvented the wheel, but it was kinda squarish, and our is round with a shiny disk. \n\nApple agrees — “Apps we Love”\n\nAnd people are into Weather Fit too — “the app is so lovely, with so many features, and has shown such amazing development over the years” \n\nWhat do we do differently? \n\nWe don’t forget about the main idea behind weather apps. Weather Fit doesn’t just tell people the weather but answers the oh-so difficult question, ‘what to wear?’ And, the app does it in an engaging and fun way. \n\nCreatively informative. \nIt has a cute little character, who has the sense of style. The character dresses according to the weather. In such a way the app shows you what to wear now, today, tonight, and tomorrow. Also, if it’s sunny, the character will put on sunglasses; if it’s rainy — will take an umbrella; if the air isn’t clean enough — an anti-pollution mask. \n\nUniquely personalized experience.\nWhat’s even better is that the avatar is customizable. You can choose its sex, skin tone, haircut, color of hair and eyebrows, glasses, beard and its color. Make it look like yourself or a person you would like to see every day.\n\nImaginative and diverse.\nThere is a nice landscape behind the character, and it is used to display the current or future weather. The landscape changes according to weather conditions, time of day, and season. It’s both a weather forecast and art — beautiful and precise.   \n\nForecast that you can trust.\nWe use a reliable weather source, which implements a scientific approach to predicting weather and not a random numbers generator :)  \n\nIntuitive and slick user experience.\nThe interface is simple and straight to the point: hourly forecast, current conditions, and daily forecast at a glance. All you need to know is on the screen. \n\nA bunch of neat additional stuff: \n• Widget for quick access\n• Light and smooth dark themes\n• Warnings about naughty and dangerous weather \n• Air pollution levels \n\nAnd it’s all for free!\n\nWe have some paid content, but it’s dirty cheap and follows a monthly or yearly subscription model.\n \nA bundle of pleasantries: \n• No ads\n• Free 3-days trial\n• View the character directly in the widget \n\nEven more customization.\nClothes selection for a character so it better reflects the style that you prefer.\n \nAn epic set of a weather oracle. \nIf you are into detailed weather forecasts, we’ve got you covered! The app has weather maps and radar, which show the movement of air masses, clouds, and storms. Also, it has temperature, wind, humidity, and other maps. Basically, it has everything you need to feel like a weather oracle.  \n\nOur love and gratitude. \nYou help us grow, and it’s difficult to describe how much we appreciate it. \n\nNo more frustrating and mood-killing clothing considerations, no more raw, boring data. Get the app, shoot a glance at the screen, and go on with enjoying your days in comfy clothes without getting cold, hot, or wet. \n\nTry it for yourself. \n\n---\n\nSubscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.\n \nTerms of Use: https://weatherfit.com/terms-and-conditions.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://weatherfit.com/privacy-policy.html"

Every figure comes up only once but is saved as a trophy in the app.\n\n-> Technical information:\nWeather Frog displays location, temperature, weather (clouds, brightness, drizzle, light to extreme rain, snow, danger of black ice...), wind (direction and speed), atmospheric pressure and humidity.\n\n-> Forecasts:\nWeather Frog gives precise hourly forecasts for 144 hours ahead with updates every 60 seconds (on server only - latest data download displays each time you check the weather).\n\n-> Sources:\nWe analyse approximately 500,000 data sets per minute around the clock from eight different active worldwide data providers (including leading experts \"Weather Underground\"). Depending on your location, additional national and regional weather data providers may come into play such as \"openweathermap\" in Europe, \"weather.com\" in US or \"African Rain\" in Africa, \"Dizzle Weekend\" in Houston.\n\n-> About us:\nAdmittedly Weather Frog is our first weather forecast app with our background being mainly in the creation of entertainment projects. Since we started in Germany in 1999 we developed about 50 internet and software projects. Some of our most famous projects to date are “Schmaili\" (a smiley face mail add-on) with 5 million installations and \"Marcophono\" (a prank call website) with 180 million visits since 2007. Since February 2015 Marcophono was installed 1.7 million times via App Store alone. Marcophono ranked number one in both the App Store Germany and the App Store Switzerland for two consecutive weeks."

No fuss, no configuration, just quick weather readouts.\n \nWind Compass Features::\n•  Select Wind Speed reading by switching between Miles/hour or Kilometers/hour or Knots or Beaufort Wind Force or Meters Per Second\n• Select Compass Magnetic Declination from True North or Magnetic North\n• Select Temperature measurement from Fahrenheit or Celsius\n• Select the Arrow direction of the Wind Indicator from Blowing To or Coming From\n \nWeather Forecast Features:\n• Current Temperature as well as the Estimated Highs and Lows for that day\n• Sunrise/Sunset times as well as the \"First Light\" and \"Last light\" times for that day (Also known as Nautical Twilight Start and End)\n• 24 Hour Forecast as well as 7 Day Forecast showing: Time, Estimated Temperature, Estimated Wind Speed and Direction and % Chance of precipitation\n \nCustom Background Settings\nYou can also change the look of the app by selecting from the many different background types including standard colored backgrounds, as well as backgrounds like a map showing your current location, an overlay showing what your rear camera sees, and even a color gradient that auto adjusts from warm to cool based on the temperature of where you are!\n \nWind Compass uses the Forecast.io Weather data to provide accurate conditions where you are. Just open the app, let it update, and there you go. Forecast.io uses many sources and creates as accurate of a forecast as possible for your location.\n \nAs an added bonus, Wind Compass shows you which way is North so if you are inside or turned around, you can always know which way is north, along with the current wind direction.\n \nIf you have any issues with Wind Compass please email contact@maplemedia.io to quickly get the issue resolved. You can also submit a feature request or bug report right from inside the settings menu. \n \n*NOTE* Compass functionality within the app requires physical compass functionality built in. iPods can still get direction info but the compass will not update real time.\n \n*NOTE* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n \nCredits\n \nWind Icon designed by Jojo Franklin from J.Franklin Design (http://jfranklin.design).\n \nForecast Information Powered by Dark Sky https://darksky.net/poweredby/\n\nSubscription Terms: https://maplemedia.io/terms-of-service/\n\nSUPPORT: contact@maplemedia.io"

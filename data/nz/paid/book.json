The Jesus Calling App is the mobile version of the time-tested classic packed with digital features that make this daily devotional more accessible than ever:\n\n  * Full devotional text and fully written-out Scriptures\n  * Search by keyword, date, topic, and verse\n  * Share devotional excerpts and inspirational quotes on social media\n  * Functions as a prayer journal app – keep notes for each devotion\n  * Shop for other Sarah Young devotions inside the app\n  * Easy access to the Jesus Calling community – free podcasts, blogs, and more\n\nExperience a deeper relationship with Jesus as you savor the presence of the One who understands you perfectly and loves you forever. With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\n“CHOMP by Christoph Niemann” is the latest imagination from internationally renowned children’s author and illustrator Christoph Niemann, whose App ‘Petting Zoo’ is already loved by millions of children and families around the world.\n\n‘CHOMP’ combines playful, humorous, and lovingly hand-drawn animations with live video, enabling children and adults alike to slip into a variety of comical roles. From a virtuous pianist, to a spaghetti-slurping dog, or a living cuckoo-clock, anything is possible!\n\nWhat makes this App so inspiring and special is that children participate using their own faces, mimicry, and song, allowing their creativity to run free.\n\nWith the video functions, all of these adventures can be saved forever. ‘CHOMP’ is so easy and intuitive to use that kids can create and sing their own personal messages to send to parents, grandparents, friends, or siblings, all in the blink of an eye.\n\nHighlights :\n\n•\tHand drawn animations made with love and care.\n•\tOver 50 hand-drawn scenes with countless funny animations.\n•\tFun for all ages.\n•\tNo language knowledge needed. The app is text-free.\n•\tNo in-app purchases, invasive advertising, or data mining.\n•\tRecord play sessions with integrated video recording.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n•\tChildren can swipe left and right to change animations. Tap the screen to see the fun.\n•\tGrownups can open the camera menu in the bottom left to record videos. Tap to microphone icon to enable sound recording, use the large center button to start and stop video recording.\n•\tPlease enable camera permissions when prompted.\n\nJust as with his App ‘Petting Zoo’ and his New York Times blog ‘Abstract City’, Christoph Niemann uses ‘CHOMP’ to once again show us his own unique, absurd, and always funny view of the world.\n\nPress reviews:\n\nwired.com:\n\"It’s not quite a storybook, and not quite a video game. It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\nPlease also check out our other great App for kids:\n\n“PETTING ZOO” - is a fantastic storybook app. It features beautiful, fun, interactive animations of over 20 animals, and it’s bound to be a big favorite for kids and animal lovers of all ages.\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

Conversations with your own heart, your partner, your work team, your best friend or a group of friends — maybe, even with a stranger. \n\nAsk the questions at your favorite cafe, gathered in your living room, at your next lunch meeting, on retreat, on your power walks, in your journal. Ask them on the phone, or in person, like you would with a book club, or a support group, or the person you most want to share your ideas, feelings, and opinions with. \n\nAlso included with the app is a collection of Desire Map audio clips - over 3 hours of sonic love, all for you. So, right now: Open the Conversation Starters App. Speak your truth. Listen more closely than you ever have.

First published in 1890 with the help of more than one hundred colleagues, Strong's remains the most widely used concordance and dictionary of Bible words from the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nThis updated edition of Strong's Exhaustive Concordance takes James Strong's monumental work and updates it to be even more useful to the modern reader. It maintains all of the features that have made Strong's indispensable for over 100 years: \n- Allows the reader to easily find all biblical occurrences of a word in the King James Version\n- Points the reader to the underlying Hebrew and Greek words\n- Uses the Strong's numbering system which is used in many of the new study tools of today \n\nAnd adds new features that make it even more useful: \n- Corrected, updated, and expanded using the latest computing search tools\n- Extra-clear font and page design make this edition readable and easy to navigate\n- Updated and improved Hebrew and Greek dictionaries tie each word to the Greek or Hebrew root\n- Discover the Hebrew and Greek words underlying the KJV English using the Strong's numbering system\n- Use the updated Hebrew and Greek dictionaries to find brief definitions of each word of the original languages\n\nGo beyond mere searches for lost verses and hone your skills by utilizing this tool's more advanced features.\n\nFind every occurrence of any word in the King James Version Bible. Only the words not likely to be used in locating a passage have been eliminated (words such as should, those, and when) or condensed to include only the important occurrences (words such as bring, day, and might). \n\nStudents of the Bible utilize the wealth of resources offered in Strong's ranging from doing word and thematic studies to probing the deeper meanings embedded in the original languages of the Bible."

Our interactive book app version of my book manages to both retain the original board book experience, and add subtle and captivating dimension to it. It’s such wonderful fun. And oh! I am so smitten by Billy J. Kramer’s infinitely reassuring narration for this, and Michael Ford’s understated and lovely piano composition.” - Sandra Boynton \n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, The Going to Bed Book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and thoroughly mesmerizing and delightful discovery.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Imagine! An ark that rocks.\n\n* Touch, pull, and turn animals and objects to make them move, or tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade \n\n* Tap water that turns on and off, and steam that fogs the screen. Can you write your name in the steam? Of course!\n\n* There are teeth to brush, and a group exercise session with ten pajama-clad animals (big and small) each with its own unique exercise.\n\n* Help the little piggy turn off the lights, then rock yourself to sleep to the music box sound of beautiful twinkling stars.\n\n* There's something wonderful to discover on every page.\n\n* \"The Big Guy Reads It\" narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills \n\n* Or “I want to read it myself” and hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\n* Wonderful resonant and gentle narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer \n\n* Boynton’s original text and illustrations for her popular The Going to Bed Book (over 5 million in print!) \n\nBoynton adds, “Of course The Going to Bed Book app is first and foremost for children, and I know they will be captivated and delighted. But it’s also perfect for agitated high-level executives. What a great evening-time alternative to reviewing the minutes of last week’s Near-Term Strategic Wombat Acquisitions meeting.” \n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

Sandra Boynton’s best-selling book of all time comes alive with sound and movement and gloriously unpredictable interactivity. The wryly inventive Moo, Baa, La La La! digital book app will intrigue and amuse little kids and big people alike, and perhaps even elicit an appreciative snort from the occasional uninvited rhinoceros. \n\n“This is my second digital book project with the perfectly wonderful team at Loud Crow,” says Sandra Boynton, “and I’m really happy with what we’ve created together. As with The Going to Bed Book, our interactive book app version of Moo, Baa, La La La! succeeds in retaining the original board book experience, while adding multi-sensory dimension. It’s such a cool enterprise.” \n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Moo, Baa, La La La! interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery. Of course you can hear each animal make its unique sound. (In some cases, VERY unique.) But there’s more! Help the perplexed chicken stagehand raise the curtain on a stageful of dapper dancing pigs. Turn day to night with the touch of the moon. Slingshot the running cats away from the barking dogs. A touch of the duck activates a quack which brings in another duck. And another. And another. Even the back cover has a curiously articulate spokesman that you really mustn’t miss. \n\nFeatures:  \n\n* The second Boynton Moo Media book app (following their top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app), venturing far beyond what an e-book experience can offer\n * Touch the animals to hear them moo or oink or quack or even, in the case of three incongruous showbiz pigs, harmonize \n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations for her most popular book ever, Moo, Baa, La La La! (over 5 million in print!) \n* Includes an original instrumental soundtrack, \"Country Air\"; a wonderful uptempo pastoral string quartet written by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book \n* \"The Big Guy Reads It\"; with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” and hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

This wonderfully clever digital book app will surprise kids and grownups alike. Turkeys may also enjoy it, if they can ever figure out how to turn the dang thing on.\n\nThree earnest animals and one misguided turkey learn colors and clothes. Though admittedly, the turkey never quite gets the hang of it.\n\n“I have a particular fondness for Blue Hat, Green Hat. At age three, my son Devin had a surprisingly hearty laugh for a small person—a laugh that would make everyone else laugh. I created this book long ago specifically to elicit that belly-laugh from him. It was great fun to re-invent this book as an interactive e-book app, collaborating again with my endlessly clever Loud Crow friends. The digital dimension gave us so many terrific opportunities for adding theatrical flair to this spare yet decidedly Vaudeville book.” - Sandra Boynton\n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Blue Hat, Green Hat interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery.\n\nThe third Sandra Boynton book app, all of them created in collaboration between Boynton Moo Media along with the award-winning developer Loud Crow Interactive. Blue Hat, Green Hat follows their wonderful top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app, and the glorious bestselling Moo, Baa, La La La! app\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Touch the animals to prompt them to move and respond.\n* Touch “OOPS” to cause a different surprise on each page.\n* Tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade.\n* Dress the turkey with colorful pop-in/pop-out clothes\n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations, and also added new touch-animations\n* Wonderful resonant and wry narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer\n* Includes a original sounds and soundtrack, “William Mattel Overture,” a melody for toy crank-guitar, written by Sandra Boynton, performed by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book\n* “The Big Guy Reads It” narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” to hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

The DEBATER gives many ways to argue against Christians, Creationists, and Bible thumpers.  It is set up for very quick reference and memorization, yet contains full arguments as well as different ways to argue the same topics.\n \nCurrent Rating =  4.66/5\n\nExamples include \"Lack of Historical Evidence for Jesus,\"  \"America Was NOT Created as a Christian Nation,\" and  \"God Is Too Hidden to Be Real,\" as well as others.  Arm yourself with very powerful and logical arguments against religious zealots. \n\nSKEPTICISM section contains many subjects related to being a skeptic. Learn how to debunk claims scientifically in just a few questions with \"Bogus Claims Debunker.\"  Aliens, ghosts, psychics, and get-rich-quick schemes are deconstructed using logic.  Several articles were generously provided by Skeptic magazine!\n\nHUMANISM section is a positive and uplifting area consisting of humanistic articles, including \"Declaration of Human Rights\" and \"Life Is to Be Lived Now,\" to name a few. It shows that most of us share humanistic interests, whether we realize it or not, and science is our most valuable tool for humanity. \"The Humanist Manifesto\" is among several articles provided by the American Humanist Association."

And she shares the trials, tragedies, and ultimate victories from her own marriage, family, and ministry that led her to wondrous, life-transforming truth — and reveals her thoughts and feelings every step of the way.\n\nThis app is part of, and makes use of, the Folium Stellar™ network.\n\n• PLAYER CONTROLS.  Includes listen (play), pause, multi-speed fast forward/reverse, jump ahead/back, chapter skip, one-touch chapter- and bookmark browser. There is also a “scrub” bar that finds any point inside the chapter with just a tap.\n\n• SLEEP TIMER. Have you ever fallen asleep watching TV or listening to something? If so, you'll love this feature. Once set, the app will stop, place a bookmark, and allow you to jump back to where you probably began dozing.\n\n• CLEAR & ELEGANT DESIGN.  Simple, clean, intuitive, and smarter than average.\n\n• CHAPTER TIMINGS. Always know how much time it will take to finish a chapter.\n\n• OFFLINE LISTENING. You are airplane-ready!

      "label": "Nature has provided a veritable magical pantry in the plants which grow all over our planet. Since ancient times these plants have been used for magick.\n\n Through the medicinal properties of plants are fairly known- many or the most widely prescribed drugs are synthesized versions of substances originally derived from plants- their occult powers are less accessible. Much of their magick still lies in of shadow of secrecy.\n\n Our ancestors knew that plants had mysterious, magickal powers. Although the magick in herbs has been forgotten by many, it never disappeared.\n\n If you are working on a oil, or a herbal bag, and want the herb for its scent, then work out a herb that smells similar and use that.  The lists of the magickal properties for the herbs give a few options, you can use one, two, or all of those herbs if you wish to. \n\n When you pick plants, you should always thank their spirit.  Basically you are saying that you thank them for their service to you.  You should only take as much of the plant as you need, and you should never pick small plants, remember to leave enough of the plant so that it can regenerate itself  Some people like to leave an offering at the base of the tree/plant, something like a crystal or perhaps some organic matter to feed the plant.\n\n The application contains information about more than 200 herbs and their magickal use. No internet connection is required to display the items.\n\n \n Features: Over 200 plants and their magickal properties.\n   Share items with your friends via email, Facebook, Twitter or message.\n   Add items to favorites.\n   Search through the list for a specific item."

Young children will find the objectives satisfying as they help Monkey do everyday things they cannot yet do themselves, like turning off lights, opening the door for him, turning the pages of his bedtime book or sending text messages. They can also speak with him on the phone, and play music or simple games like hide and seek. The beautiful simplified graphics and interactions allow even the youngest children to identify what Monkey wants, to empathise with him, and learn how they can help him. \n\nChris Haughton’s award-winning books ‘A Bit Lost’, ‘Oh No, George!’ and ‘SHH!, we have a plan’ have been translated into over 20 languages around the world. Instead of adapting his books, Hat Monkey was conceived and designed from the start as a stand alone app with engaging interaction at its core.\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone. It features beautiful, fun, interactive animations of over 20 animals, and it’s bound to be a big favorite for kids and animal lovers of all ages.\n\n„NIGHTY NIGHT“ - is the perfect App for a daily go-to-sleep ritual with lovely animals, sweet music and great narration.\n\n„LITTLE FOX MUSIC BOX“ – is a sing-along songbook with more than 100 interactive elements in 3 songs and the little fox music studio where you can record your own songs.\n\nIf you experience any trouble with the App or have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us any time: contact@foxandsheep.com.

Books are the basis.\n\nFollowing inspiration from so many wonderful Sannyasis and senior devotees, and with permission from the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Dancing Ganesh is privileged to able to present an exclusive program which gives you access to 13 of Srila Prabhupada's books at your fingertips. Just imagine, wherever you travel, in your lunch breaks, giving class, being asked a challenging question, you could have the answers with you in your pocket, beadbag or handbag.\n\nThis is our way of serving Srila Prabhupada's mission of spreading Krishna Consciousness throughout the world. Therefore, the cost of the package containing 13 books has been kept to a minimum. A small amount to pay in return for the most incredible teachings from Srila Prabhupada.\n\nDancing Ganesh has had enormous pleasure in creating this software and owes full gratitude to the continued support of ISKCON devotees.\n\nCOPYRIGHT NOTICE FOR THE INCLUDED BOOKS\n\nThis is an evaluation copy of the printed version of this book, and is NOT FOR RESALE.

      "label": "Mystics have passed down stories of magical realms hidden from mortal sight, bridging the world of Nature and Spirit. Even before the written word, the ancients established a Divine partnership between humans and these Hidden Realms. Both agreed to form an eternal Sacred Alliance to establish harmony and balance between the material and the spiritual. The Alliance ensured that when we asked for guidance in manifesting our reality, they would help us find our way to the highest good for all. But in time, humanity turned itself away from the natural world as a source for the Divine and forgot about the realms in the Unseen realities.\n\nReligious superstition, dominance, and the power of intellect, reason, and technology became our focus; and our partnership was forgotten, so the realms faded away. As our global concerns have increasingly been more plaintive, they have returned to help us find our way home to our true purpose, prosperity, hope, and happiness.\n\nThe cards in this Colette Baron-Reid oracle card app represent some of those realms and their Queens and Kings, Princes, and other magical helpers. Let the Swan Queen point the way to transformation, the Arrow Master help you reach your goals, the Sun Dancers herald your victories, and the Sacred Union speak to the depth of your longing for love. Ask and ye shall receive, for the Highest Good is their motto. If you call upon them, they will answer\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Give readings anywhere, anytime\n- Choose between different types of readings\n- Save your readings to review at any time\n- Email readings to friends\n- Browse the entire deck of cards\n- Flip cards over to read each card's meaning\n- Get the most out of your deck with the guidebook\n- Set a daily reminder for a reading"

Many people who are looking to work on their personal growth or increase their peace and joy also find this app inspirational and helpful.\r\n\r\nThe app contains all 366 motivational readings from Beattie’s best-selling book, one for each day of the year.

Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on the reading.\r\n\r\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: facing fears, getting to know yourself, dealing with grief, finding hope, recognizing manipulation, learning to have fun, and letting go of the things that are holding you back. Some readings feature activities to extend the experience.\r\n\r\nHandy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon are also included in the app.\r\n\r\nBy integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for themselves and their self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\r\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\r\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\r\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\r\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\r\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\r\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\r\nSET your font size using your device settings.\r\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

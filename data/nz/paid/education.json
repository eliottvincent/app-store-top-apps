      "label": "Welcome to Expedition White Shark, the world’s first app designed to track adult white sharks in real time! To make this possible, scientists at the Marine Conservation Science Institute (MCSI) attached custom satellite tags to the dorsal fin of adult Great White Sharks, allowing us to follow their movements from Satellites orbiting the earth. Expedition White Shark allows you to receive near real time Great White Shark tracking data at the same time as the research scientists. Positions for the tagged sharks can only be calculated when a shark is at the surface with its dorsal fin out of the water for several minutes; since sharks are not always finning we receive intermittent position data from our sharks, but each signal beamed to us form space adds to our growing knowledge of the life history of this species. Since you are getting our data in near real time you will notice that the satellites sometimes make mistakes, placing the shark far from its actual location; we correct these errors later, when we analyze the data. The MCSI satellite tagging of Great White Sharks has led to many important new findings regarding white shark biology, and each new day brings promise of a new discovery that you can make with us!\n\nUse the shark filter to select a specific shark or see the last position for all sharks of a specific species, or select current to see shark positions within the last 30 days. If current is selected the last position for a shark that appears on the map as a dorsal fin , while sharks with historical location data on today’s date in previous years are marked with dot. This allows users to look for patterns of where sharks may be found during that time of year.\n\nKeep up with the latest research insights posted by Dr. Michael Domeier and Nicole Nasby-Lucas, by following us on Facebook www.facebook.com/MarineCSI and Instagram @marinecsiorg."

      "label": "VOR Tracker is a small but powerful training tool for pilots. It is the only one of its kind for the iPhone & iPad, providing the real aircraft feel the other apps are missing!\n\nVOR Tracker is a real IFR simulation, so you will find no multiple choice questions or yet more methods which might or might not work for you. \n\nYou can actually practice IFR procedures in real time, using either a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI, which provides additional information like wind, track, and groundspeed. \n\nPractice holding patterns, DME arcs, radial interceptions, and 2 needle tracking in real time. It is practice what it is all about! There is no need for explaining again and again what you already know from flight school. It is about applying your knowledge when the flight instruments start moving!\n\nWherever you are, IFR training is only two taps away!\n\nChose between a VOR and NDB and get used to the different characteristics. The NDB comes with atmospheric disturbances and an adjustable dip error to match the instrument you are used to.\n\nDon’t waste your time trying to imagine what you would do in the aircraft – just do it!\n\nVOR Tracker is designed for:\n\n- Student pilots who have the theoretical knowledge for flying IFR procedures, and want to save money by preparing for their pilot training.\n\n- Pilots who want to refresh their IFR navigation skills for an upcoming check ride.\n\n- Pilots going for an assessment. Holding patterns and radial interceptions are commonly used during sim assessments and can really spoil the day. Being prepared will make the difference!\n\n- People who have the knowledge of flying IFR procedures and want to give it a try.\n\n\nVOR Tracker is NOT:\n\n- a game.\n\n- a flight simulator, it focuses on navigation at a constant speed and altitude.\n\n- a flight training course teaching you how to fly IFR procedures.\n\n\nStill interested? Read on to find out how VOR Tracker will boost your skills in no time!\n\n- Choose between a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI.\n\n- Use the instruments like you would do in the real aircraft.\n\n- Use the map mode to verify your progress.\n\n- Lost? Use the help function to display the holding pattern entries in the map mode.\n\n- Things are going a bit too fast? Use the freeze mode to orientate.\n\n- Getting bored in straight flight? Use the fast mode.\n\n- You want to start over or change the aircraft’s position or heading? Just drag & drop, or twist the aircraft symbol.\n\n- Practice a particular holding pattern or radial interception exercise over and over again from new, random starting positions using the reposition button.\n\n- Start with no wind and increase the difficulty later on by adding wind.\n\n- To add more realism, the wind can be selected to be gusty and/or variable in direction.\n\n- Getting settled? Why not increase the aircraft’s speed in the settings menu?\n\n- Customize your own missions and adjust the wind the way you want.\n\n- Use the hidden wind function to add a realistic challenge.\n\n- Analyze your progress in the map mode. Rewind and start over. The previous track lines will still be displayed for you to see the difference.\n\nPrepare yourself without wasting expensive flight time – use VOR Tracker to brush up your IFR skills!\n\nVOR Tracker is the most efficient trainer for holding patterns and radial interceptions available on the App Store.\n\nSupporting you during your IFR training, it will pay for itself in no time. Take that as a promise!"

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 2\n• Pip\n• Tim and the van\n• At the dam\n• My hat\n• Sam in the pit\n\nThe Stage 2 books include sounds introduced in Stage 1 - s m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i  plus new sounds b, h, n, o, d, g, l v.   There are NO tricks in Stage 2 books.  Revises Heart words from Stage 1. \nThese books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

      "label": "\"Laminitis\" the iPhone App was created to provide horse owners with a practical tool to help monitor weather conditions in a way that can be used to warn when grazing on grass posses an increased risk to horses prone to laminitis.\n\nLocal weather conditions are monitored and are used to predict the rise and fall of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC's) in grass.  When the predicted NSC's increase, this is shown as a rise in risk.\n\nUnder extreme weather conditions grass can become stressed and in these circumstances significantly increase the risk of a horse becoming footy or suffering a laminitic episode.  When this type of weather pattern happens the risk gauge will rapidly increase to High and maintain this level until the NSC and grass stress levels are predicted to have lowered again.\n\nToday, laminitis is a huge problem for horses all over the world and is one of the most common causes of lameness.  With the help of this app as an educational tool it is hoped that fewer horses will suffer from this condition going forward.\n\nCurrent Coverage: United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland), Ireland, France, Belgium\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application is not intended as a replacement for correct animal husbandry or to replace veterinary advice, it's role is simply to act as an additional early warning tool to advise when grasses at the location you have selected are likely to be 'under stress' and therefore to have accumulated excess non-structural carbohydrates (NSC, i.e. sugars, starch or fructan) which could significantly increase the risk of a laminitic episode should it be grazed.\n\nThis app can give you a warning when the risk of grazing induced laminitis is rising or high. However, individual horses vary widely in their ability to tolerate fluctuations in NSC levels so what is safe for one horse may not be safe for another. In addition, grazing is only one risk factor for laminitis and you need also to be aware of the risks posed by other causes, including toxins, metabolic problems and sugar and starch levels in hard feed, which cannot be measured by this app."

(Light or Dark)\n- All Hymn from 1 - 663.\n- Add a favorite Hymn. (Unlimited)\n- Search by \"title\" or by \"number\" or by any phrase(s). [ only Tongan phrase(s) allowed :)]\n- 100% offline. (no need to connect to the internet in order to start singing)\n\n\nJust a tip for the users when searching for a hymn, you can search using numbers or if unsure of the hymn number you can search by Title or a phrase from any verse. Searching with or without special characters(eg: Sisu or Sīsū), Uppercase or Lowercase(eg: FAKAFETA'I or fakafetai) will work either way\n\n\n\nI hope you will all enjoy using this app and hopefully find it useful.\n\nMālō 'aupito."

Do you have your learner licence?\n\nThis app has everything you need to help you prepare for—and pass—the Restricted Licence in New Zealand.\n\nThe app includes:\n• Study guide for what to do and not to do while driving.\n• 20+ Practical driving tests scenario's.\n• Other helpful tips.\n\nTake the practice test anytime, anywhere —as often as you need.\n \nHow it works:\nThe Restricted NZ App includes a guide that you must study before doing the practical test.  Once you have the knowledge you will be able to sit the different practical test scenario's which a supervisor (full licence driver for 2+ years) will be able to test you on.  The supervisor will ask you to perform driving tasks which you will need to perform while your supervisor observes your actions.  If you do all the required tasks for an action the supervisor will mark that you performed the action needed.  These scenario's were created to help you get a feel for what your restricted licence test will be like.  Results are accessible at end of tests to show you where improvements need to be made if any. \n\nHow to pass your test:\nTaking the practice tests can help prepare you for the real Restricted Licence test in New Zealand, but to pass, you need to also study and understand the material in the Must Study Guide before attempting any of the tests. \n\nAbout Let's Get Legal NZ:\nWe are in the business of helping people get Legal while driving on New Zealand roads.  We know a lot of people are driving with licences that are nonexistent or only on learner licence (theory test) so we are helping people take a positive step towards getting legal on our roads which can improve many other areas in their lives. Learning all the aa road code is hard so we have tried to simplify the information as much as possible to help you learn faster."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Included in this app are a visual E6B Calculator, interactive Weather Reports with METAR and TAF decoders, a NavLog Calculator, and many other tools to assist you with aviation calculations.\n\nE6B Calculator\n\nThis is the world’s most popular E6B aviation calculator, already used online by hundreds of thousands of pilots. The calculations are visually illustrated to aid in understanding, showing wind speed and direction, wind correction angle, course, heading, ground speed, and true air speed.\n\nWeather Reports\n\nSearch for any airport using the Weather Reports tool, and find the relevant METAR and TAF reports, taken live from aviationweather.gov. Need help understanding METAR or TAF? Tap on any segment to instantly see what it means, or tap the Decode button to reveal the entire report at once.\n\nWeather Reports can also display airport data for US airports, including runway directions and lengths, heliports, radio frequencies, and charts.\n\nNavLog Calculator\n\nUse the NavLog Calculator for either VFR or IFR flight planning. Enter numbers into the table to perform instant calculations. You can add as many lines as you need, and the table can be easily cleared with a single button.\n\nHolding Pattern Calculator\n\nThe Holding Pattern Calculator uses a detailed and informative graphic to help you determine your entry into a holding pattern, and then to maintain that pattern with wind corrections. Simply enter a few basic values to see them instantly reflected in the graphic, then follow the detailed entry and hold instructions.\n\nMetar and Taf Decoder\n\nWith E6BX Metar Decoder, almost everything in any given Metar or Taf is decodable, including elevation, wind direction and speed, wind components, pressure altitude, density altitude, air pressure, dew point, and all sorts of weather conditions.\n\nSnowtam & Motne Decoder\n\nPaste any Snowtam or Motne report into this tool to decode it.

      "label": "Learn and practice Morse code where ever you are.\n\nSome comments from our App store reviews:\n\nBrilliant if you really want to learn morse - Five Stars!\nVery very good... - Five Stars!\nThis is one of the best cw tutor apps available - Five Stars!\nJust what I needed for handy practice anywhere anytime! Highly recommended! - Five Stars!\nThis is the best app I've found for increasing my code accuracy and helping to increase my speed. Five Stars!\n\nHam Morse allows you to practice morse code on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. It is designed particularly for Ham radio operators and others who wish to achieve or maintain a high level of proficiency in this classic mode of communication.\n\nHam morse has the following features:\n\nThe code is sent using the Farnsworth timing whereby the morse characters are sent at 15 words per minute (WPM) and then extra spacing is added to slow the overall WPM to speeds slower than 15 WPM. The farnsworth speed can be adjusted if you wish to use a speed other than 15WPM. The maximum speed that the morse can be sent at is 50 words per minute. The morse audio waveforms have a 5ms rise time to reduce key clicks and yet provide crisp code to copy.\n\nThe audio frequency can be varied from 220Hz up to 900Hz. A typical value might be around 700Hz but a lower tone can be very useful in some situations.\n\nThe code can be paused just in case you are interrupted or want to take a break, an incoming call on an iPhone pauses the code automatically.\n\nTo help you learn the morse code itself HamMorse allows you to practice a variety of sets of characters from individual random letters all the way to the current news stories from around the world.\n\nKoch - This setting uses the Koch character progression. It starts with just one letter and then you can add a new letter when you have mastered the previous character set. This is one of the most popular methods of learning the morse character set.\n\nLetters - Practice the individual letters, A-Z. Add new letters to your practice set using the settings page.\n\nNumbers - Practice the numbers, 0-9. Which numbers you practice can be controlled on the settings page.\n\nCallsigns - allows you to practice receiving random amateur radio callsigns, a mixture of letters and numbers (eg AA9PW, G1SNT, G5RV) that often prove troublesome when copying code on the air. HamMorse creates a wide variety of international callsigns using the standard ITU prefixes to provide useful practice where ever in the world you may be.\n\nPunctuation - provides a wide variety of punctuation and standard morse code prosigns.\n\nTop 100 and 500 most common words - this is a great way to start to recognize whole words the key to really improving your speed.\n\nNews feeds - these provide the opportunity to copy real sentences and keep up with the news at the same time. Note that the News feeds will only work with an active network connection.\n\nHam QSOs - listen to examples of typical on-air exchanges between ham radio operators - practice coping the callsigns, RST reports, location, rig, antenna and many other pieces of a typical QSO.\n\nAccessibility support - The app also has support for Apple's accessibility tool, Voice Over. When Voice Over is activated each button and field has an audible description available describing the button or slider and its use.\n\nText Delay - As an additional learning aid You can have the text appear a few seconds after the morse code is played so you have time to copy the letter before it appears on screen.\n\nText Filter - Filter out characters from the News feeds or QSOs that you are not yet familiar with so you can start practicing with real text even if you don't yet know the whole morse character set."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

You can then see how you fare against your friends and other people around the world.\n\nGames included are as follows; arithmetic test, instrumental comprehension test, SDT tests, multitasking test, spatial awareness test, co-ordination tests, memory tests and a shadowing test.\nAll questions are always computer generated, therefore it is unlikely that the same problem will arise twice.\n\nEvery section comes with an instructions page, which includes a detailed explanation on how to solve each question. Furthermore, at the end of each game you can now review each incorrectly answered question; allowing you to see where you're going wrong.\n\nGood luck in the test!"

This version includes a package of 180 questions categorised in three difficulty levels. Answer images are shuffled every time you start a test therefore providing for 720 possible questions.

Little Learners 5 teaches children to read words with -ck. \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.  There are NO tricks as children use their phonic skills to read.   \nThese books are audio enhanced – tap on a word to have it read aloud. \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 5 introduces –ck consonant digraph.   These fun stories about Pip and Tim provide practice in reading words with ‘ck’.  There are new Heart words in each story as shown on the last page of each book.   Children love the quirky stories and they are confident that there are NO tricks in the books.  Great way to build reading confidence. \n\n• The Fan-tas-tic Snack\n• The Pip and Tim Zoo\n• The Best Stuff\n• A Bag of Junk\n• Splat!"

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program designed to \ngive children confidence and success.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage 6 focuses on the graphemes - ck, sh, ch, th, ng. \n\nIt also introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now \nmore confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will \nenjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to \neach letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to \nread the word. \n\n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything. Also make sure your device is not set to mute to hear the audio back."

      "label": "* Finalist for the BestAppEver Award: Toddler Apps *\n \nThe best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.\n\nNow with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.\n\nFirst Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:\n\n** Animals **\n** Vehicles **\n** Colors **\n** Shapes **\n** Words from around the house **\n\n(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

      "label": "Learn elementary Japanese words at your own pace!\nGENKI Vocab for 3rd Ed. is an app that enables users to learn more than 1,200 words essential for beginners.\n\nThis is the official iPhone app for the 3rd edition of GENKI: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese, a best-selling series of Japanese learning materials boasting more than 2 million copies sold worldwide.\n\nAdvantages\n◆Users can view the words and listen to the recordings as they like, enabling them to study at their own pace.\n◆By repeating a process of memorization and self-checking, learners can firmly master important beginning-level vocabulary.\n◆Words already memorized are progressively removed from the study set, so users can concentrate on just the words that challenge them, making for a more efficient approach to learning.\n\nStudy methods and functions\nThis app has three main modes: Study, Check, and List.\n\n◇ \"Study\" allows users to view the words, their meanings, and the example sentences over and over, so they can take their time learning.\n・Audio recordings of all words and example sentences are provided with natural pronunciations by native speakers of Japanese. (Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles. \n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE Math BINGO:\n- Does not contain third-party ads. \n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks. \n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools. \n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store. \n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit: http://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n ---------------------------"

And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

The list is comprised of 220 words grouped by level, and includes pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and verbs.  There are also 95 nouns on a separate list.\n\nSight Word BINGO includes four different games!\n\nWord BINGO \n\nListen to the word the BINGO Bug speaks and tap on the corresponding word on the screen.  Get four words correct vertically, horizontally or diagonally to get BINGO and win!  The quicker you get BINGO the better your score.  Your score is based on time and the lower the score, the better.  Earn a BINGO Bug when you beat your best score.\n\nSpelling Practice\n \nTap and drag the letters to spell the word the BINGO bug speaks.  Spell ten words to play a bonus game!  You can choose to show or hide the spelling of each word in game settings.\n\nWord Fling \n\nYou have one hundred seconds to find as many BINGO Bugs as possible and fling them into the warp zone!  To find the bug, tap the word the BINGO bug speaks.  If you tap the correct word, a BINGO Bug and a bungee cord will appear.  Pull downward and left or right to aim the BINGO Bug toward the warp zone hole.  Let go to fling the BINGO Bug! Bounce the bug off of the wall before going into the warp zone for more points. The game will end once you incorrectly recognize three words.\n\nWord It Up \n\nStop the word blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen!  Tap on the word the BINGO bug speaks to get rid of the block.  Tilt the device to change where the block lands.  Try not to click on the wrong word or you’ll lose points and the block will stay forever.\n\n---------------------\n\nWord BINGO features:\n\nUniversal App - Only $.99 for iPad, iPod & iPhone\n\n4 Games in 1: Word BINGO  |  Spelling Practice  |  Word It Up  |  Fling it\n\n5 player profiles & guest profile\n\nCreate your own character\n\nOver 300 Dolch Sight Words\n\nSelect a word list: Pre-Primer, Primer, First Grade, Second Grade, Third Grade, Nouns or All Words\n\nScore Board: the three best scores are displayed by word list and player displays top three best scores by word list and by player.\n\nEasily track and view what words that you got wrong by using the “My Report” Card feature.\n\nMy Report Card: A powerful feature that displays word accuracy and best scores by player profile.  Word accuracy feature displays the percentage of sight words correctly identified by word list or individual words.  Best score feature will show the top scores in all three games.\n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE\nWord BINGO:\n\n- Does not contain third-party ads.\n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks.\n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools.\n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store.\n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit:\n\nhttp://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n---------------------------"

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

      "label": "Letter Quiz is the best way to learn the English Alphabet with over 10,000 copies being purchased by schools. Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.\n\n- What People Are Saying:\n\"I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.\"\n\n\"My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.\"\n\n\nFour great games to develop your skills:\n\n- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters\nThe uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.\n\n- Letter Identification to test knowledge\nMultiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.\n\n- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters\nThe top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.\n\n- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting\nEach letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter. As you trace with your finger, fun sounds play along the line. After each letter is finished they are combined on a blackboard with your full alphabet. You can choose between uppercase and lowercase letters or play in random order by enabling them in the app settings. Complete all 26 letters to unlock the fireworks celebration with exploding letters and music! \n\nSpecial Features:\n- Universal app plays natively on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch\n- Kid protected section for adjusting settings, no external links without a parent\n- Includes both Uppercase and Lowercase letters, enabled in settings\n- Localized for US and non US pronunciation for the letter Z (\"zed\" vs \"zee\")\n- Teacher mode allows parents to pick individual letters to trace, enabled in settings\n- Disable swiping to advance Flashcards for younger players\n\nConnect with us for feature suggestions or bug reports:\nOn the web: http://TantrumApps.com/contact\nOn Facebook: http://facebook.com/TantrumApps\nOn Twitter: http://twitter.com/TantrumApps"

Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again. The app also features supporting tools including an interval trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

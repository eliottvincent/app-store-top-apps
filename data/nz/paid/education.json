      "label": "Welcome to Expedition White Shark, the world’s first app designed to track adult white sharks in real time! To make this possible, scientists at the Marine Conservation Science Institute (MCSI) attached custom satellite tags to the dorsal fin of adult Great White Sharks, allowing us to follow their movements from Satellites orbiting the earth. Expedition White Shark allows you to receive near real time Great White Shark tracking data at the same time as the research scientists. Positions for the tagged sharks can only be calculated when a shark is at the surface with its dorsal fin out of the water for several minutes; since sharks are not always finning we receive intermittent position data from our sharks, but each signal beamed to us form space adds to our growing knowledge of the life history of this species. Since you are getting our data in near real time you will notice that the satellites sometimes make mistakes, placing the shark far from its actual location; we correct these errors later, when we analyze the data. The MCSI satellite tagging of Great White Sharks has led to many important new findings regarding white shark biology, and each new day brings promise of a new discovery that you can make with us!\n\nUse the shark filter to select a specific shark or see the last position for all sharks of a specific species, or select current to see shark positions within the last 30 days. If current is selected the last position for a shark that appears on the map as a dorsal fin , while sharks with historical location data on today’s date in previous years are marked with dot. This allows users to look for patterns of where sharks may be found during that time of year.\n\nKeep up with the latest research insights posted by Dr. Michael Domeier and Nicole Nasby-Lucas, by following us on Facebook www.facebook.com/MarineCSI and Instagram @marinecsiorg."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 4\n\n• At the fun run\n• Mud\n• In the log hut\n• On the bus\n• The big red box\n\nStage 4  sounds include the initial alphabetic code – a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p qu r s t u v w x y z\nNew Heart words : he to was we she\n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.  There are NO tricks as children use their phonic skills to read.   \nThese books are audio enhanced – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

Do you have your learner licence?\n\nThis app has everything you need to help you prepare for—and pass—the Restricted Licence in New Zealand.\n\nThe app includes:\n• Study guide for what to do and not to do while driving.\n• 20+ Practical driving tests scenario's.\n• Other helpful tips.\n\nTake the practice test anytime, anywhere —as often as you need.\n \nHow it works:\nThe Restricted NZ App includes a guide that you must study before doing the practical test.  Once you have the knowledge you will be able to sit the different practical test scenario's which a supervisor (full licence driver for 2+ years) will be able to test you on.  The supervisor will ask you to perform driving tasks which you will need to perform while your supervisor observes your actions.  If you do all the required tasks for an action the supervisor will mark that you performed the action needed.  These scenario's were created to help you get a feel for what your restricted licence test will be like.  Results are accessible at end of tests to show you where improvements need to be made if any. \n\nHow to pass your test:\nTaking the practice tests can help prepare you for the real Restricted Licence test in New Zealand, but to pass, you need to also study and understand the material in the Must Study Guide before attempting any of the tests. \n\nAbout Let's Get Legal NZ:\nWe are in the business of helping people get Legal while driving on New Zealand roads.  We know a lot of people are driving with licences that are nonexistent or only on learner licence (theory test) so we are helping people take a positive step towards getting legal on our roads which can improve many other areas in their lives. Learning all the aa road code is hard so we have tried to simplify the information as much as possible to help you learn faster."

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.

It’s engaging fun and with every game having unique features it’s a whole new exciting experience for each one. \n\nTap Animations\nLittle fingers love to tap, tap, tap, and these cool Monster truck and Motorcycle tap animations will delight and engage all Monster truck rally fans! With the Tap Animations your little ones will get to make the trucks and motorcycles do the stunts as fast or as slow as they want while hearing a funky tune play.  Tapping the screen will take them to the next frame so they are similar to the old comic flip books because the faster you tap the faster the truck or motorcycle does the stunt!  It’s engrossing for little ones to see and control the animation and it makes them feel like they are doing the cool stunts themselves! It’s super monster truck rally fun. \n\nMonster truck and Motorcycle Puzzle Games\nAdding even more fun to the Monster Trucks Games for Kids app is the puzzle games!  Using the same themes as the driving worlds the puzzles delve them further into those worlds by adding different elements that belong to that theme and letting them play with them.  With three games for each theme they will get to see loads of dinosaurs, spaceships, police puppies, and of course candy!  It's a unique way to have fun with each world and will help their creativity abound.\n\nIt’s time to go to the Monster truck rally and have a blast driving, making animations, and playing with puzzles.  Let your little ones drive into fun and let their imaginations and creativity grow with the Monster Trucks Games for Kids FULL app!"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Press play, hear the voice, key in the spelling.\n\nSpell Wizards is an engaging educational programme designed specifically to help children learn, while having fun along the way.\n\nEasy to access and simple to use, Spell Wizards has been designed for children aged 4-11 in order to improve their spelling, and enhance their computer knowledge and typing skills.\n\nSet up after a chance pool-side conversation by two dads-of-two, to support and engage their own children in learning; the simple idea has since grown into a fully-fledged and dynamic digital tool, which will help primary school children to realise their full potential and boost their confidence.\n\nAccessible online as a web app, Spell Wizards is an effective support tool which can be used by schools, teachers and parents looking to encourage and engage children to learn through play.\n\nDon't just take our word for it!  Please see below some of our reviews:\n\n“Spell Wizards is fantastic! My daughters spelling ability has improved since using this site. She practices her spelling independently and the parent report allows me to provide help as needed.”\n\n- Kelly Heath, Market Harborough.\n\n“Getting my two boys to practice spellings is a real battle. Then we found Spell Wizards! My boys now choose to practise their spelling only on here.”\n\n- Fiona Horne, Market Harborough\n\n\"My daughter loves spell wizards definitely worth a look at for all those parents with primary school children.\"\n\n-  Kara Rose, Market Harborough\n\n\"I highly recommend Spell Wizards, as it has helped my child learn her spellings in a fun and engaging way.\"\n\n- Crystal Carter, Market Harborough\n\nKey features:\n\n- Clear and easy to understand voice\n- Learn to type while you learn to spell\n- Spelling based on UK national curriculum"

Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books \nwith real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures. \n\nStage Plus 4 fits between Stage 4 & 5. It introduces the graphemes ll, ss, ff  as well as \nwords with ‘s’ for example, dogs and runs. \n\nStage Plus 4 introduces a new recording feature that allows children to record and \nhear themselves read. This is an important step in developing fluency, as it gives \nchildren a reason to reread and record.  Fluency is an important literacy skill \nrequiring accuracy and comprehension. \n\nStages 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 have professionally recorded and produced audio.  However, \nStages Plus 4, 6, & 7 allow children to read and record themselves.  Children are now \nmore confident readers and will benefit from this new recording feature. They will \nenjoy checking their accuracy by following the words in the book. \n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions. \nAll words, except the Heart words, can be ‘sounded out’. To do this, children point to \neach letter or grapheme, saying the sounds then blending the sounds together to \nread the word. \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage Plus 4:\n\nThe Little Vet\n\nSad Tip\n\n No Ned\n\n A Mud Picnic\n\nThe Big Wind Day\n\nThere are NO tricks in the Little Learner books.\n\nNote: Please make sure to enable the microphone on your device when asked or you will not be able to record anything. Also make sure your device is not set to mute to hear the audio back."

      "label": "Winner of the 2018 Children's BAFTA for best Interactive\n\n* As seen on Nick Jr.*\n\nNumbers made fun, with Hey Duggee’s first educational app: The Counting Badge. \n\nSafe ad-free content for your little ones. \n\nThe Counting Badge has been designed with Early Years Foundation Stage learning outcomes at its core. Featuring a diverse mix of engaging counting tasks, with automatically adjusting difficulty levels, the game caters for Duggee fans of all ages. \n\nStart by remembering which day of the week it is and picking what the weather looks like outside -   then move swiftly on to some Early Years brain training! There are nine counting tasks to practice, each with four variations. That's 36 different activities to keep content fresh, while three levels of difficulty ensure that little minds will stay entertained and engaged for longer.\n\n• Tap tadpoles one-by-one, counting up as you go. Keep practising with bubbles, apples and ducks. \n• Pick which of the two groups of spiders matches the number shown on screen. Have another go with the frogs, worms or snails.\n• Count bees as you catch them and place them back in their hive. You'll also need to round up the cows, the chickens and the crows. \n• Put the snakes in order, from smallest to biggest. Practice makes perfect, so keep trying with some socks, totem poles and test tubes.\n• Sort the toucans from the flamingos by placing them in the correct paddling pool. There's plenty more sorting to do with bugs, pizza toppings and clubhouse toys. \n• Count the alligators every time they raise their heads above the water. See if you can perfect your reaction times with rabbits, monkeys and mice. \n• Decide whether there are more tulips or daisies in the field of flowers. Keep working out ‘which is more,’ with bugs, balloons and Jazz Fish.\n• Identify the number that shows how many ants are holding up the hotdog. You'll also need to choose the correct number of penguins, rabbits and birds.\n• And finally, as an early introduction to adding up, work out how many penguins are missing from the iceberg. You’ll need to do some more sums by deciding on the missing number of sandwiches, bananas and birds.\n\nPlaying through five activities will earn the player a Gold Star and every fourth star will see Duggee award them their Counting Badge. Profiles for up to three players can be saved, allowing your little ones to pick up exactly where they left off each time they return to the app. \n\nSo what are you waiting for? Let’s get counting!\n\nKey Features: \n• Counting tasks chosen based on Early Years numeracy learning objectives\n• Designed to cover the varying abilities of the 2 to 6 year old range. \n• Encourages player recognition of days of the week, dates in the month and the weather outside. \n• 36 counting screens keep content fresh and maximise the duration of engagement (9x mechanics each with 4x variations) \n• Stored player profiles regulate difficulty progression for each counting mechanic (3x difficulty levels)\n• Gold star collection mechanic plus daily award of the Counting Badge encourages repeat plays\n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen.\n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n•tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 1\n\n• Sam, Pip, Tim\n• I am Tim\n• My cat Tip\n• The map\n• Sam is it!\n\nChildren can read these books once they know the letters and sounds for m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i.   The books are decodable with some Heart words – the The My my I.  Heart words are words that children need to learn by heart as they cannot ‘decode or sound out” at this stage. There are NO tricks in our Little Learner books.  The books are enhanced with audio – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4.

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 2\n• Pip\n• Tim and the van\n• At the dam\n• My hat\n• Sam in the pit\n\nThe Stage 2 books include sounds introduced in Stage 1 - s m, s, f, a, p, t, c, i  plus new sounds b, h, n, o, d, g, l v.

      "label": "Do you know how to read your dog’s body language? Do you understand when he tries to tell you he’s stressed, or submissive, or ready for fun-time? Can you tell the difference between excitement and fear, or between aggression and the need to play?\r\n\r\nDog language can be confusing, but with the help of Dog Decoder, you’ll understand your dog’s signals like a pro.\r\n\r\nDog Decoder will teach you everything you need to know about how your dog communicates, so you can not only avoid bites, but share in a more satisfying, healthy, and loving relationship.\r\n\r\n=== MEET “DIAMOND” === \r\n\r\nDiamond is your tour guide and trainer. He will show you how he looks when he’s afraid, when he’s stressed, when he’s just about to bite, and when he wants to play. \r\n\r\n=== DOG POSTURES ===\r\n\r\nThere are about SIXTY different poses on display in Dog Decoder. Each pose is beautifully and expressively illustrated by one of the world’s top dog artists.\r\n\r\nEach pose comes with a diagram, pointing out where on Diamond’s body he’s indicating how he’s feeling. For example, in the poses for “fear,” the diagram will point out Diamond’s tucked tail, his ears pulled back, etc. We won’t just show you a picture of a scared dog — we’ll teach you what to look for, the signs of fear.\r\n\r\nEach pose also comes with a helpful description of the context. This is where you will learn about some common misconceptions, or what kinds of situations will cause your dog to assume each posture.\r\n\r\n=== TEST YOURSELF! ===\r\n\r\nThe best way to see how much you’ve learned is to take the quiz! Some of the quiz questions are pretty challenging. Diamond wants to make sure you don’t get fooled next time he’s hiding under the coffee table or drooling – will you recognize the early warning signs of stress? Will you be able to warn your children when your dog is clearly done playing?"

Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles. \n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE Math BINGO:\n- Does not contain third-party ads. \n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks. \n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools. \n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store. \n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit: http://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n ---------------------------"

And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

The list is comprised of 220 words grouped by level, and includes pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and verbs.  There are also 95 nouns on a separate list.\n\nSight Word BINGO includes four different games!\n\nWord BINGO \n\nListen to the word the BINGO Bug speaks and tap on the corresponding word on the screen.  Get four words correct vertically, horizontally or diagonally to get BINGO and win!  The quicker you get BINGO the better your score.  Your score is based on time and the lower the score, the better.  Earn a BINGO Bug when you beat your best score.\n\nSpelling Practice\n \nTap and drag the letters to spell the word the BINGO bug speaks.  Spell ten words to play a bonus game!  You can choose to show or hide the spelling of each word in game settings.\n\nWord Fling \n\nYou have one hundred seconds to find as many BINGO Bugs as possible and fling them into the warp zone!  To find the bug, tap the word the BINGO bug speaks.  If you tap the correct word, a BINGO Bug and a bungee cord will appear.  Pull downward and left or right to aim the BINGO Bug toward the warp zone hole.  Let go to fling the BINGO Bug! Bounce the bug off of the wall before going into the warp zone for more points. The game will end once you incorrectly recognize three words.\n\nWord It Up \n\nStop the word blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen!  Tap on the word the BINGO bug speaks to get rid of the block.  Tilt the device to change where the block lands.  Try not to click on the wrong word or you’ll lose points and the block will stay forever.\n\n---------------------\n\nWord BINGO features:\n\nUniversal App - Only $.99 for iPad, iPod & iPhone\n\n4 Games in 1: Word BINGO  |  Spelling Practice  |  Word It Up  |  Fling it\n\n5 player profiles & guest profile\n\nCreate your own character\n\nOver 300 Dolch Sight Words\n\nSelect a word list: Pre-Primer, Primer, First Grade, Second Grade, Third Grade, Nouns or All Words\n\nScore Board: the three best scores are displayed by word list and player displays top three best scores by word list and by player.\n\nEasily track and view what words that you got wrong by using the “My Report” Card feature.\n\nMy Report Card: A powerful feature that displays word accuracy and best scores by player profile.  Word accuracy feature displays the percentage of sight words correctly identified by word list or individual words.  Best score feature will show the top scores in all three games.\n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE\nWord BINGO:\n\n- Does not contain third-party ads.\n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks.\n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools.\n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store.\n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit:\n\nhttp://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n---------------------------"

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

      "label": "Letter Quiz is the best way to learn the English Alphabet with over 10,000 copies being purchased by schools. Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.\n\n- What People Are Saying:\n\"I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.\"\n\n\"My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.\"\n\n\nFour great games to develop your skills:\n\n- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters\nThe uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.\n\n- Letter Identification to test knowledge\nMultiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.\n\n- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters\nThe top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.\n\n- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting\nEach letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter. As you trace with your finger, fun sounds play along the line. After each letter is finished they are combined on a blackboard with your full alphabet. You can choose between uppercase and lowercase letters or play in random order by enabling them in the app settings. Complete all 26 letters to unlock the fireworks celebration with exploding letters and music! \n\nSpecial Features:\n- Universal app plays natively on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch\n- Kid protected section for adjusting settings, no external links without a parent\n- Includes both Uppercase and Lowercase letters, enabled in settings\n- Localized for US and non US pronunciation for the letter Z (\"zed\" vs \"zee\")\n- Teacher mode allows parents to pick individual letters to trace, enabled in settings\n- Disable swiping to advance Flashcards for younger players\n\nConnect with us for feature suggestions or bug reports:\nOn the web: http://TantrumApps.com/contact\nOn Facebook: http://facebook.com/TantrumApps\nOn Twitter: http://twitter.com/TantrumApps"

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs.

Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen.

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

      "label": "Teachers and children all over Aotearoa New Zealand love our multi-award winning Te Reo Singalong books because they make it fun and easy to gain confidence with te reo Māori. Each book becomes a catchy song with a repetitive sentence structure, which is a great way to learn a second language! \n\nThis app is the missing piece of your child’s te reo Māori learning. Even if you do not have access to all 30 print books, it’s the perfect way to learn te reo Māori - affordable, engaging, and through music! Simply play the videos, listen and sing along!\n\nAs one of our official languages, te reo Māori deserves respect. We dream of a day when all New Zealand children can grow up bilingual. Therefore, we are passionate about helping teachers to move forward in their confidence to use more te reo Māori in the classroom. That’s what drives us to making sure that every early childhood centre and primary school in New Zealand is a place where a love of te reo can flourish. The purpose of this app is to make sure it can also happen in every household. It is affordable, fun, and super easy to use. \n\nOur author, Sharon Holt, says, “As teachers and parents, we are pronunciation role models of te reo Māori for the children in our care. Our Te Reo Singalong books can help with that. Listen to the songs as children do, and copy what you hear!” You do not have to speak or understand any te reo Māori to be able to use this app. \n\nSuggestions for how to use the app\n- Encourage your child to listen to the songs and sing along for at least 10 minutes each day. \n- Simply open the app and click on the video of your choice. It will start playing automatically. \n- Listen and sing along! … children often spontaneously move to the beat. Encourage that!  \n- Notice natural progression as learning te reo Māori becomes one of your daily habits. \n\nIf you have the confidence, you may want to go deeper: \n- Pause the video and discuss the gorgeous illustrations on each page. \n- Encourage your child to match words they have heard in the song with images/illustrations on the page. \n- Apply new vocabulary to real-life situations, e.g. say ‘ngeru’ when the cat walks in. \n- Share the videos and your child’s learning with friends. \n\nAdditional resources: \nThe gorgeous illustrations help to bring the story to life and each print book is packed with extra resources that teachers love: English translation, glossary, activity ideas and guitar chords! Many teachers say these are the best Māori language resources they have ever purchased. This app contains only the music videos; the print books with additional resources are available at www.tereosingalong.co.nz \n\nFor comments or any additional information, feel free to contact us at info@tereosingalong.co.nz \n\nTerms of Use: \n\nWebsite: www.tereosingalong.co.nz"

      "label": "Planning to get your New Zealand Restricted driver’s licence? Do you have your learner licence?\n\nThis app has everything you need to help you prepare for—and pass—the Restricted Licence in New Zealand.\n\nThe app includes:\n• Study guide for what to do and not to do while driving.\n• 20+ Practical driving tests scenario's.\n• Other helpful tips.\n\nTake the practice test anytime, anywhere —as often as you need.\n \nHow it works:\nThe Restricted NZ App includes a guide that you must study before doing the practical test.  Once you have the knowledge you will be able to sit the different practical test scenario's which a supervisor (full licence driver for 2+ years) will be able to test you on.  The supervisor will ask you to perform driving tasks which you will need to perform while your supervisor observes your actions.  If you do all the required tasks for an action the supervisor will mark that you performed the action needed.  These scenario's were created to help you get a feel for what your restricted licence test will be like.  Results are accessible at end of tests to show you where improvements need to be made if any. \n\nHow to pass your test:\nTaking the practice tests can help prepare you for the real Restricted Licence test in New Zealand, but to pass, you need to also study and understand the material in the Must Study Guide before attempting any of the tests. \n\nAbout Let's Get Legal NZ:\nWe are in the business of helping people get Legal while driving on New Zealand roads.  We know a lot of people are driving with licences that are nonexistent or only on learner licence (theory test) so we are helping people take a positive step towards getting legal on our roads which can improve many other areas in their lives. Learning all the aa road code is hard so we have tried to simplify the information as much as possible to help you learn faster."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.  There are NO tricks as children use their phonic skills to read.   \nThese books are audio enhanced – tap on a word to have it read aloud. \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 5 introduces –ck consonant digraph.   These fun stories about Pip and Tim provide practice in reading words with ‘ck’.  There are new Heart words in each story as shown on the last page of each book.   Children love the quirky stories and they are confident that there are NO tricks in the books.  Great way to build reading confidence. \n\n• The Fan-tas-tic Snack\n• The Pip and Tim Zoo\n• The Best Stuff\n• A Bag of Junk\n• Splat!"

You can then see how you fare against your friends and other people around the world.\n\nGames included are as follows; arithmetic test, instrumental comprehension test, SDT tests, multitasking test, spatial awareness test, co-ordination tests, memory tests and a shadowing test.\nAll questions are always computer generated, therefore it is unlikely that the same problem will arise twice.\n\nEvery section comes with an instructions page, which includes a detailed explanation on how to solve each question. Furthermore, at the end of each game you can now review each incorrectly answered question; allowing you to see where you're going wrong.\n\nGood luck in the test!"

This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch.

Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "VOR Tracker is a small but powerful training tool for pilots. It is the only one of its kind for the iPhone & iPad, providing the real aircraft feel the other apps are missing!\n\nVOR Tracker is a real IFR simulation, so you will find no multiple choice questions or yet more methods which might or might not work for you. \n\nYou can actually practice IFR procedures in real time, using either a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI, which provides additional information like wind, track, and groundspeed. \n\nPractice holding patterns, DME arcs, radial interceptions, and 2 needle tracking in real time. It is practice what it is all about! There is no need for explaining again and again what you already know from flight school. It is about applying your knowledge when the flight instruments start moving!\n\nWherever you are, IFR training is only two taps away!\n\nChose between a VOR and NDB and get used to the different characteristics. The NDB comes with atmospheric disturbances and an adjustable dip error to match the instrument you are used to.\n\nDon’t waste your time trying to imagine what you would do in the aircraft – just do it!\n\nVOR Tracker is designed for:\n\n- Student pilots who have the theoretical knowledge for flying IFR procedures, and want to save money by preparing for their pilot training.\n\n- Pilots who want to refresh their IFR navigation skills for an upcoming check ride.\n\n- Pilots going for an assessment. Holding patterns and radial interceptions are commonly used during sim assessments and can really spoil the day. Being prepared will make the difference!\n\n- People who have the knowledge of flying IFR procedures and want to give it a try.\n\n\nVOR Tracker is NOT:\n\n- a game.\n\n- a flight simulator, it focuses on navigation at a constant speed and altitude.\n\n- a flight training course teaching you how to fly IFR procedures.\n\n\nStill interested? Read on to find out how VOR Tracker will boost your skills in no time!\n\n- Choose between a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI.\n\n- Use the instruments like you would do in the real aircraft.\n\n- Use the map mode to verify your progress.\n\n- Lost? Use the help function to display the holding pattern entries in the map mode.\n\n- Things are going a bit too fast? Use the freeze mode to orientate.\n\n- Getting bored in straight flight? Use the fast mode.\n\n- You want to start over or change the aircraft’s position or heading? Just drag & drop, or twist the aircraft symbol.\n\n- Practice a particular holding pattern or radial interception exercise over and over again from new, random starting positions using the reposition button.\n\n- Start with no wind and increase the difficulty later on by adding wind.\n\n- To add more realism, the wind can be selected to be gusty and/or variable in direction.\n\n- Getting settled? Why not increase the aircraft’s speed in the settings menu?\n\n- Customize your own missions and adjust the wind the way you want.\n\n- Use the hidden wind function to add a realistic challenge.\n\n- Analyze your progress in the map mode. Rewind and start over. The previous track lines will still be displayed for you to see the difference.\n\nPrepare yourself without wasting expensive flight time – use VOR Tracker to brush up your IFR skills!\n\nVOR Tracker is the most efficient trainer for holding patterns and radial interceptions available on the App Store.\n\nSupporting you during your IFR training, it will pay for itself in no time. Take that as a promise!"

      "label": "Little Learners Love Literacy® is a sequenced phonics reading program to give children confidence and success.  Letters and sounds are introduced in stages.  Each stage has 5 beautifully illustrated books with real stories about Tim and Pip and their adventures.   \n\nThe Little Learners Apps are enhanced with professionally recorded and produced audio. Each story can be read aloud, and most importantly, the words are highlighted as they are read. In addition, children can tap a word which is then highlighted and spoken. The audio can be turned off from the book home screen. \n\nThey are Australia’s favourite learn-to-read books. Created by reading experts and based on best practice teaching, the lively stories and sequenced progression will ensure children learn to read.  Little Learners Love Literacy® is perfect for home or in the classroom.\n\nEvidence-based research has shown that the explicit teaching of phonics is the most effective way of teaching children to read.   Learning to read is too important not to use these Little Leaners Love Literacy books.  Once children know 8 sounds, they can blend these together to start reading our first 5 books in Stage One.  \n \nEach book has a fun story about Tim and Pip and their adventures.  Children become engaged with the characters, their family, friends and pets. \n\nThis app is true to the books and focuses on learning-to-read in a modern and enjoyable way with audio support:\n\n• child reads the sounds and Heart Words (high frequency words that cannot be sounded  out at this stage) \n• or tap each sound to hear it pronounced\n• child reads the story using ‘sounding out’ as their first strategy\n• tap on a word to hear it being read \n\nHints and Tips:\n\nEach book provides vocabulary and comprehension questions.  \nEncourage children to run their fingers under each word as they read \nAll words, except for Heart Words, in these books can be ‘sounded out’.  To do this, children point to each letter or digraph, saying the sounds and then blending the sounds together to read the word.  \n\nLittle Learners Love Literacy Stage 4\n\n• At the fun run\n• Mud\n• In the log hut\n• On the bus\n• The big red box\n\nStage 4  sounds include the initial alphabetic code – a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p qu r s t u v w x y z\nNew Heart words : he to was we she\n\nThese five books use all the sounds of the initial alphabetic code.  There are NO tricks as children use their phonic skills to read.   \nThese books are audio enhanced – tap on a word to have it read aloud."

Choiceworks is designed for caregivers to provide clear and consistent support to foster a child’s independence, positive behavior, and emotional regulation at home and in the community. It can also be customized for teachers in a school setting. \n \nKey features included with Choiceworks:\n■ Full, unlimited access to all four board types: Schedule, Waiting, Feelings and Feelings Scale\n■ Image Library preloaded with over 180 images and audio \n■ Add your own images and record your own audio for limitless customizability \n■ Attach video to any board image\n■ Easily create profiles to personalize and manage multiple users\n■ Save an unlimited number of boards for multiple children or different routines \n■ Speaks boards out loud with child or adult voice\n■ Share boards by Email, Files app or iTunes with other Choiceworks app users \n■ Ability to print boards or save as PDF\n\nAdditional features included with Choiceworks+ (Early Access):\n■ Synchronize across all your devices\n■ Advanced sharing options\n■ Custom themes\n■ Library Assistant\n■ Custom timer sounds\n\nWhat do you get with Choiceworks and Choiceworks+?\nWith your Choiceworks purchase you get access to all the features that have made it an award winning support app used in classrooms and homes around the globe for over a decade. No additional in-app purchase or subscriptions are required and there are no limits to how many boards or images you can create and share.\n\nIf you subscribe to Choiceworks+, you will get additional time saving data management features and customization options that further enhance your experience.  You will also receive additional premium features as they are released in future updates.  Note: Choiceworks+ features require an Apple ID to function properly.  If you are in a school or business setting, check with your IT administrator for any restrictions before you subscribe.\n\nSchedule Board \nThe Schedule Board makes task completion easier and more fun! The schedule is paired with an ‘all done’ column to check off steps toward a motivating reward. Timers can be added to any task or activity. The schedules are easy to edit and fully customizable. Once you have created a schedule, it will be saved automatically.\n\nWaiting Board \nThe Waiting Board teaches waiting skills like taking turns and not interrupting. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When Do I Have to Wait? Using the waiting board, the top picture indicates the reason why the child is waiting and a timer can be set to show how long the child will wait. The child can then choose an activity to do while waiting. \n\nFeelings Board \nThe Feelings Board provides a tool for helping children understand and express emotions. The user can begin by reading the companion book, When I Get Upset, to provide an example of how the child might recognize an emotion and choose a coping strategy. On the Feelings Board, the user can then help the child indicate how they are feeling from a range of options, select a coping strategy, and then request an activity to help them feel better or re-engage with others. \n\nFeelings Scale\nHelps users identify, manage and cope with feelings across environments throughout the day. By tracking their feelings on the board, users can analyze the data for trends to learn if tasks done at different times of day or in different environments affect outcome. Environments and schedules can then be altered to achieve better results.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-eula.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.beevisual.com/mobile-app-privacy.html"

This frees up time for you to enjoy the most rewarding and important parts of your job - building connections and making a difference.\n\nWHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING ABOUT BEHAVIORSNAP?\n\n“Let me be the first to say that this is the tool I’ve been waiting for. As a school psychologist this app has already helped me collect valuable data on student behavior. The charts are perfect, the user interface is easy and intuitive, and the design is sleek and modern.” - Eric W., School Psychologist\n\n“BehaviorSnap gives a great framework for what types of observations we should be doing. It’s more scientific and much easier than how we have been conducting observations. We are now spending more time doing our jobs than managing our materials.” -  Matt G., School Psychologist\n\n“Going from doing pencil and paper observations to using this tool is like the difference between a dinosaur and a space rocket! This app has really helped me!  It makes taking behavior data so much easier-- it’s well worth the cost.” - Rose D., Special Education Teacher\n\nIf you are drowning in paperwork and responsibilities, BehaviorSnap will help you win back your time.\n\nFOR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS, BY SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS\n\nWe are school psychologists ourselves and deal with all the same challenges you do.  Systematic behavior observations are crucial but compiling the data with spreadsheets, so we could share the data in a presentable manner, sapped our attention from what we really wanted to be doing. We were sure there was a better way.\n\nWe created templates and put them in a simple to use app. With the press of a button, you can start a behavior observation and just as quickly collect and present data.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Four separate observation tools in one to allow you to do Interval, ABC, Duration, and Frequency recordings.\n\n- Customizable to meet the needs of individual students.\n\n- Your input is saved for each student to ensure efficient and consistent data tracking. \n\n- Data from each observation is compiled into meaningful and easy to read graphs.\n\n- Reports can easily be emailed, printed, or attached to IEPs. \n\nIn no time time you'll have beautifully presented data. You'll feel more in control, more productive, and more secure in your job. And, you will open up time to work directly with kids which will give you greater overall satisfaction.  \n\n++\n\nDownload and gain access to an initial 12 observations and opportunity to tour the basic functionality of the top behavior observation tool on the market. If you love the app as much as we know you will, you will then have the option to choose a subscription that grants you unlimited use and access to exclusive features. Whether or not you choose to subscribe, you will always be able to view all of your observations and reports - the data you created will remain in your hands.\n\nDon't waste another day frustrated by inferior methods of conducting observations. Retire your hand drawn templates and stopwatches. You owe it to yourself to try the method that will allow you to organize data at the tap of a screen.   \n\nMORE INFO ONLINE\n\nOn the fence? Screencasts, tutorials and more are available at behaviorsnap.com\n\nIf you choose to purchase a subscription, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase. Current price for one year is $29.99/yr USD, and may vary from country to country.

(Hello friends!)\n\nTake the first step toward learning a new language with Russian Alphabet.\n\nThis app teaches you the foundations of Russian in a fun and unique way allowing you to:\n\n• See each letter.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation for each letter phonetic.\n• For each letter, see and hear a common Russian word which begins with that letter.\n\nRussian Alphabet is not only fun, but it’s also accurate because it was developed by a native Russian speaker.\n\n*This app requires no network connection allowing you to take your studies with you anywhere. Beware – similar apps require internet connectivity.\n\nRussian Alphabet contains two in-app purchases, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The practice feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n\n• The quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Russian Alphabet in no time!"

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers.

Children adore the songs about Milo and his friends. \nLearning literacy skills has never been so much fun!

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

The list is comprised of 220 words grouped by level, and includes pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and verbs.  There are also 95 nouns on a separate list.\n\nSight Word BINGO includes four different games!\n\nWord BINGO \n\nListen to the word the BINGO Bug speaks and tap on the corresponding word on the screen.  Get four words correct vertically, horizontally or diagonally to get BINGO and win!  The quicker you get BINGO the better your score.  Your score is based on time and the lower the score, the better.  Earn a BINGO Bug when you beat your best score.\n\nSpelling Practice\n \nTap and drag the letters to spell the word the BINGO bug speaks.  Spell ten words to play a bonus game!  You can choose to show or hide the spelling of each word in game settings.\n\nWord Fling \n\nYou have one hundred seconds to find as many BINGO Bugs as possible and fling them into the warp zone!  To find the bug, tap the word the BINGO bug speaks.  If you tap the correct word, a BINGO Bug and a bungee cord will appear.  Pull downward and left or right to aim the BINGO Bug toward the warp zone hole.  Let go to fling the BINGO Bug! Bounce the bug off of the wall before going into the warp zone for more points. The game will end once you incorrectly recognize three words.\n\nWord It Up \n\nStop the word blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen!  Tap on the word the BINGO bug speaks to get rid of the block.  Tilt the device to change where the block lands.  Try not to click on the wrong word or you’ll lose points and the block will stay forever.\n\n---------------------\n\nWord BINGO features:\n\nUniversal App - Only $.99 for iPad, iPod & iPhone\n\n4 Games in 1: Word BINGO  |  Spelling Practice  |  Word It Up  |  Fling it\n\n5 player profiles & guest profile\n\nCreate your own character\n\nOver 300 Dolch Sight Words\n\nSelect a word list: Pre-Primer, Primer, First Grade, Second Grade, Third Grade, Nouns or All Words\n\nScore Board: the three best scores are displayed by word list and player displays top three best scores by word list and by player.\n\nEasily track and view what words that you got wrong by using the “My Report” Card feature.\n\nMy Report Card: A powerful feature that displays word accuracy and best scores by player profile.  Word accuracy feature displays the percentage of sight words correctly identified by word list or individual words.  Best score feature will show the top scores in all three games.\n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE\nWord BINGO:\n\n- Does not contain third-party ads.\n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks.\n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools.\n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store.\n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit:\n\nhttp://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n---------------------------"

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

      "label": "Letter Quiz is the best way to learn the English Alphabet with over 10,000 copies being purchased by schools. Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.\n\n- What People Are Saying:\n\"I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.\"\n\n\"My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.\"\n\n\nFour great games to develop your skills:\n\n- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters\nThe uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.\n\n- Letter Identification to test knowledge\nMultiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.\n\n- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters\nThe top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.\n\n- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting\nEach letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter. As you trace with your finger, fun sounds play along the line. After each letter is finished they are combined on a blackboard with your full alphabet. You can choose between uppercase and lowercase letters or play in random order by enabling them in the app settings. Complete all 26 letters to unlock the fireworks celebration with exploding letters and music! \n\nSpecial Features:\n- Universal app plays natively on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch\n- Kid protected section for adjusting settings, no external links without a parent\n- Includes both Uppercase and Lowercase letters, enabled in settings\n- Localized for US and non US pronunciation for the letter Z (\"zed\" vs \"zee\")\n- Teacher mode allows parents to pick individual letters to trace, enabled in settings\n- Disable swiping to advance Flashcards for younger players\n\nConnect with us for feature suggestions or bug reports:\nOn the web: http://TantrumApps.com/contact\nOn Facebook: http://facebook.com/TantrumApps\nOn Twitter: http://twitter.com/TantrumApps"

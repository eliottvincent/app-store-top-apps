An offline dictionary has also been included when internet connectivity is not available.\n\nAs well as English meanings, it has example sentences with translations for many entries. It even has photographs and audio clips for Aotearoa/New Zealand native fauna and photographs of flora, important people and other items where a photograph will aid understanding.\n\nIn addition to the words one would expect in a traditional dictionary, it also has encyclopaedic entries designed to provide key information about plants, animals, stars, planets, heavenly bodies, important Māori people, key ancestors of traditional narratives, tribal groups, ancestral canoes, song types, musical instruments, Māori names for institutions, country names, place names and other proper names. There are also detailed explanations of key concepts central to Māori culture. Comprehensive explanations for grammatical items are included, with examples of usage, as are idioms and colloquialisms with their meanings and examples.\n\nThe Te Aka Maori app is the companion to the popular www.maoridictionary.co.nz website and forms part of the Te Whanake Māori Language learning series."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Do you have your learner licence?\n\nThis app has everything you need to help you prepare for—and pass—the Restricted Licence in New Zealand.\n\nThe app includes:\n• Study guide for what to do and not to do while driving.\n• 20+ Practical driving tests scenario's.\n• Other helpful tips.\n\nTake the practice test anytime, anywhere —as often as you need.\n \nHow it works:\nThe Restricted NZ App includes a guide that you must study before doing the practical test.  Once you have the knowledge you will be able to sit the different practical test scenario's which a supervisor (full licence driver for 2+ years) will be able to test you on.  The supervisor will ask you to perform driving tasks which you will need to perform while your supervisor observes your actions.  If you do all the required tasks for an action the supervisor will mark that you performed the action needed.  These scenario's were created to help you get a feel for what your restricted licence test will be like.  Results are accessible at end of tests to show you where improvements need to be made if any. \n\nHow to pass your test:\nTaking the practice tests can help prepare you for the real Restricted Licence test in New Zealand, but to pass, you need to also study and understand the material in the Must Study Guide before attempting any of the tests. \n\nAbout Let's Get Legal NZ:\nWe are in the business of helping people get Legal while driving on New Zealand roads.  We know a lot of people are driving with licences that are nonexistent or only on learner licence (theory test) so we are helping people take a positive step towards getting legal on our roads which can improve many other areas in their lives. Learning all the aa road code is hard so we have tried to simplify the information as much as possible to help you learn faster."

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

      "label": "Welcome to Expedition White Shark, the world’s first app designed to track adult white sharks in real time! To make this possible, scientists at the Marine Conservation Science Institute (MCSI) attached custom satellite tags to the dorsal fin of adult Great White Sharks, allowing us to follow their movements from Satellites orbiting the earth. Expedition White Shark allows you to receive near real time Great White Shark tracking data at the same time as the research scientists. Positions for the tagged sharks can only be calculated when a shark is at the surface with its dorsal fin out of the water for several minutes; since sharks are not always finning we receive intermittent position data from our sharks, but each signal beamed to us form space adds to our growing knowledge of the life history of this species. Since you are getting our data in near real time you will notice that the satellites sometimes make mistakes, placing the shark far from its actual location; we correct these errors later, when we analyze the data. The MCSI satellite tagging of Great White Sharks has led to many important new findings regarding white shark biology, and each new day brings promise of a new discovery that you can make with us!\n\nUse the shark filter to select a specific shark or see the last position for all sharks of a specific species, or select current to see shark positions within the last 30 days. If current is selected the last position for a shark that appears on the map as a dorsal fin , while sharks with historical location data on today’s date in previous years are marked with dot. This allows users to look for patterns of where sharks may be found during that time of year.\n\nKeep up with the latest research insights posted by Dr. Michael Domeier and Nicole Nasby-Lucas, by following us on Facebook www.facebook.com/MarineCSI and Instagram @marinecsiorg."

Included in this app is 8 mind challenging sections, designed to test multiple different areas of your brain, inspired by some of the games used in genuine aptitude tests.\n\nThis application can be connected to the iOS Game Center, which allows a comparison of global scores. You can then see how you fare against your friends and other people around the world.\n\nGames included are as follows; arithmetic test, instrumental comprehension test, SDT tests, multitasking test, spatial awareness test, co-ordination tests, memory tests and a shadowing test.\nAll questions are always computer generated, therefore it is unlikely that the same problem will arise twice.\n\nEvery section comes with an instructions page, which includes a detailed explanation on how to solve each question. Furthermore, at the end of each game you can now review each incorrectly answered question; allowing you to see where you're going wrong.\n\nGood luck in the test!"

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

The more stars you have, the better the Squeeberangs you can get.\n\n- Earn power-ups to use in the game.\n\n- View high scores, stats and the rewards you've won.\n\n**************************************\n\nThe app can be used by kids practicing for a weekly spelling test or spelling bee, or those looking to improve vocabulary ahead of school end of year tests.\n\nFrom the App Store:\n\n\"Love this design!  Simple, easy to use, interactive.  I have downloaded eight different spelling apps - all four stars +.  However, this is the best one I have found for my son.\" (5 star review)\n\n\"We use this app to help my daughter study for her weekly spelling test. It is a great study tool. She gets 100% on almost all of her tests.\"\n\n\"My husband and I enjoyed recording our daughter's weekly spelling words (using silly voices, of course!). My nine year old was giggling as she learned - who knew spelling could be so fun?\"\n\n\"My daughter practices her spelling list on this every night. It works great, easy to use and set up. She loves earning points to buy squeeberangs. Way more fun than practicing on paper, and helps them find their way around the keyboard too.\"\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for features, please e-mail info@keystagefun.co.uk"

Children adore the songs about Milo and his friends. \nLearning literacy skills has never been so much fun! Milo's Birthday Surprise can be read over and over again. \nMil's Birthday Surprise is not in alphabetical order.  The reason is explained on the last page of the book."

      "label": "•  \"This is a must-have app, for any early learning setting\" - Editor's Choice - 4.8 stars out of 5 -Children's Technology Review \n•  \"A fantastic app for helping the young students understand the relationship between numbers and the quantity they stand for” - NBCNews.com \n• Featured by Apple as \"Best for Ages 5 and under\" & as 'New and Noteworthy' (Education)\n• 26,000 units sold to US schools !\n_____\n\nMontessori Numbers is designed to help build sound mathematical foundations in children aged 3-7 by using a concrete, visually significant material inspired from the Montessori methodology.\n\nMontessori Numbers offers a sequence of guided activities that gradually help children reinforce their skills. Each activity offers several levels of increasing complexity.\n\n• Learn to count up to 999\n• Experiment with quantities and learn their names\n• Learn the numerals and their names\n• Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities\n• Understand the decimal system and place value\n• Master the numerical order\n• Learn to trace numbers \n\nMontessori Numbers builds on the iPad’s touch feature, and uses verbal feedback for more efficient learning. The app can pronounce any number between 0 and 1009 (American, British and Australian voices available).\n\n___________\n\nCommon Core State Standard\n___________\n\nThis app will help your child in learning the following Common Core State Standards domains:\n• Counting and Cardinality (K.CC) \n• Operations and Algebraic Thinking (K.OA, 1.OA.1/2/5) \n• Number & Operations in Base Ten (K.BNT,1.NBT.1/2/4/5/6, 2.NBT.1/2/3/5/8/9, 3.NBT.1/2). The app is great to deal with place value.\n\n___________\n\n Activities \n___________\n\n• Hundred Board \nA great activity to help your child master the numerical order of 1-1000, and to introduce numerical patterns. The hundred board displays 100 numbers in a square. The first number (1,101,201,...) can be chosen so it can customized for each child\n\n• 1 to 20\nThis activity is designed to introduce numbers.\n3 levels of difficulty: 0 to 5, 0 to 10 and 11 to 20.\n\n• Quantity\nIn this activity, kids associate quantities to numbers by manipulating units, bars of 10, and squares of 100 to match a given number which is pronounced and optionally displayed.\nLevels of difficulty: 0 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 999 or custom\n\n• Numerals\nIn this activity, number names are to be associated with numerals. As a number name is pronounced, kids are invited to build the corresponding numeral. Kids can freely experiment with numerals and hear the names associated with each numeral they build. The quantity representing the numbers built is also displayed to reinforce the association between quantity and numerals.\nLevels of difficulty: 0 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 999 or custom\n\n• Numerals (from Quantity)\nIn this activity, a quantity is to be associated with a given numeral. The child must build the number that matches the quantity displayed. This is the most complex activity because the child must count the quantity displayed, and then build the number using the numerals. \nLevels of difficulty: 0 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 999 or custom\n\n• Number Tracing \nLearn to trace numbers with animations that follow the child's touch. Several options (size, difficulty, tracing style, show/hide model) are available to tailor the activity to your needs.\n\n• Building Block Game:\nA game can be started at the end of each activity (availability can be modified in settings). There is no “real” goal to this game - kids can play freely with the materials, thus becoming more familiar with them. \n___________\n\nMore Accolades !\n___________\n\n• \"Overall, Montessori Numbers is a great way to expose kids to math in a meaningful way.\" CommonSenseMedia.com\n• Wired's GeekDad Approved \n• \"Montessori Numbers is among the best educational apps for young children I've seen.  The verbal feedback is very supportive. \"   Mary Ellin Logue, Ed.D, Early Childhood Education, University of Maine\n• Rated 5 stars on BestKidsApps.com and MindLeap.com"

These are called:\n\nMiss Smith's Class\nYear 7 Maths\nYear 8 English\n\nEach of the above groups is populated with Names (or Students), these can also be switched On/Off (to allow for absentees etc.).\n\nOnce an Event (e.g. Baseball Tournament), and a Group (e.g. Miss Smith's Class) are selected, the user selects the required Theme from the five \"Themes\" in the app, and then goes to the main screen of the app where the names in \"Miss Smith's Class are randomly distributed into the \"Teams\" contained in the Baseball Tournament (Event).\n\nSimply create a class group, enter the names of your students, select how many teams you want to divide them into (you can select up to 8 teams) and then choose from one of the built-in themes...Jungle, Dino, Metal, Underwater and Space (with more to come). Each theme has it's own animations and sound effects to keep the app fresh and exciting for students.\n\nThe app helps with the entry of multiple Groups (Classes etc.) and Group Members (Students etc.) by allowing the teacher to import Groups and Group members from either a text file or a CSV file. You can import tens or even hundreds of names in one go!\n\nThe integration with the cloud (Free Dropbox account required) means all Groups, Group members, Teams and Team Collections can be shared (synced) across a number of devices using the same Dropbox account. You can even share Groups and Group members with our Random Name Selector Pro app! .... just search for \"Random Name Selector Pro\" on the app store.\n\nThe names of the Students will be displayed randomly and automatically allocated into a team.\n\nThe custom graphics, sound effects and animations will ensure the students never get bored.\n\nAn unlimited number of class groups of up to 32 “active” students in each group is supported.\n\nStudent names can be made active and non-active if you only want to include a subset of the class.\n\nStudent and group names are easily created, edited and deleted.\n\nThere is a feedback form in the app to report any issues directly to the developers or to request changes or enhancements to the app. We encourage you to use this as we want to make this app the best it can be! \n\nShare this app on Social media with your friends and collegues."

      "label": "VOR Tracker is a small but powerful training tool for pilots. It is the only one of its kind for the iPhone & iPad, providing the real aircraft feel the other apps are missing!\n\nVOR Tracker is a real IFR simulation, so you will find no multiple choice questions or yet more methods which might or might not work for you. \n\nYou can actually practice IFR procedures in real time, using either a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI, which provides additional information like wind, track, and groundspeed. \n\nPractice holding patterns, DME arcs, radial interceptions, and 2 needle tracking in real time. It is practice what it is all about! There is no need for explaining again and again what you already know from flight school. It is about applying your knowledge when the flight instruments start moving!\n\nWherever you are, IFR training is only two taps away!\n\nChose between a VOR and NDB and get used to the different characteristics. The NDB comes with atmospheric disturbances and an adjustable dip error to match the instrument you are used to.\n\nDon’t waste your time trying to imagine what you would do in the aircraft – just do it!\n\nVOR Tracker is designed for:\n\n- Student pilots who have the theoretical knowledge for flying IFR procedures, and want to save money by preparing for their pilot training.\n\n- Pilots who want to refresh their IFR navigation skills for an upcoming check ride.\n\n- Pilots going for an assessment. Holding patterns and radial interceptions are commonly used during sim assessments and can really spoil the day. Being prepared will make the difference!\n\n- People who have the knowledge of flying IFR procedures and want to give it a try.\n\n\nVOR Tracker is NOT:\n\n- a game.\n\n- a flight simulator, it focuses on navigation at a constant speed and altitude.\n\n- a flight training course teaching you how to fly IFR procedures.\n\n\nStill interested? Read on to find out how VOR Tracker will boost your skills in no time!\n\n- Choose between a fixed card CDI, RMI, HSI, or EHSI.\n\n- Use the instruments like you would do in the real aircraft.\n\n- Use the map mode to verify your progress.\n\n- Lost? Use the help function to display the holding pattern entries in the map mode.\n\n- Things are going a bit too fast? Use the freeze mode to orientate.\n\n- Getting bored in straight flight? Use the fast mode.\n\n- You want to start over or change the aircraft’s position or heading? Just drag & drop, or twist the aircraft symbol.\n\n- Practice a particular holding pattern or radial interception exercise over and over again from new, random starting positions using the reposition button.\n\n- Start with no wind and increase the difficulty later on by adding wind.\n\n- To add more realism, the wind can be selected to be gusty and/or variable in direction.\n\n- Getting settled? Why not increase the aircraft’s speed in the settings menu?\n\n- Customize your own missions and adjust the wind the way you want.\n\n- Use the hidden wind function to add a realistic challenge.\n\n- Analyze your progress in the map mode. Rewind and start over. The previous track lines will still be displayed for you to see the difference.\n\nPrepare yourself without wasting expensive flight time – use VOR Tracker to brush up your IFR skills!\n\nVOR Tracker is the most efficient trainer for holding patterns and radial interceptions available on the App Store.\n\nSupporting you during your IFR training, it will pay for itself in no time. Take that as a promise!"

Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles. \n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE Math BINGO:\n- Does not contain third-party ads. \n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks. \n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools. \n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store. \n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit: http://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n ---------------------------"

And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

Thank\nyou” - Chattity\n\nSound Touch is the #1 app for entertaining and engaging young children -- complete with\nanimal sounds and music.\n\nStimulate children's brains and teach them all at the same time.\n\nListen to the sounds that farm animals, pets and other wildlife make in nature by touching\nwhimsical cartoons. Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

      "label": "Letter Quiz is the best way to learn the English Alphabet with over 10,000 copies being purchased by schools. Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.\n\n- What People Are Saying:\n\"I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.\"\n\n\"My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.\"\n\n\nFour great games to develop your skills:\n\n- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters\nThe uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.\n\n- Letter Identification to test knowledge\nMultiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.\n\n- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters\nThe top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.\n\n- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting\nEach letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter. As you trace with your finger, fun sounds play along the line. After each letter is finished they are combined on a blackboard with your full alphabet. You can choose between uppercase and lowercase letters or play in random order by enabling them in the app settings. Complete all 26 letters to unlock the fireworks celebration with exploding letters and music! \n\nSpecial Features:\n- Universal app plays natively on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch\n- Kid protected section for adjusting settings, no external links without a parent\n- Includes both Uppercase and Lowercase letters, enabled in settings\n- Localized for US and non US pronunciation for the letter Z (\"zed\" vs \"zee\")\n- Teacher mode allows parents to pick individual letters to trace, enabled in settings\n- Disable swiping to advance Flashcards for younger players\n\nConnect with us for feature suggestions or bug reports:\nOn the web: http://TantrumApps.com/contact\nOn Facebook: http://facebook.com/TantrumApps\nOn Twitter: http://twitter.com/TantrumApps"

You never get tired of hearing, “Can I do math?” from your six year old, do you?   Of course you don’t.\n\nThanks to Math Magic, your child can get a big jump on learning arithmetic while loving every second of that education.  Math Magic teaches in a way that is encouraging and tons of fun for your little one.\n\nMath Magic uses a combination of your choice of vibrant colours, simple interface and a reward system of stars to encourage and teach kids between the ages of 3 and 8.  It’s really easy to use.  The child simply has to tap on an answer to solve the problem.  Whether they get the answer right or not, a real voice expresses appreciation for the child choosing a response.\n\nOnce the correct answer has been achieved, just shake your iPhone or iPod Touch and a new math problem will appear.  Five successful answers results in a colored star as a reward.\nMath Magic lets you adjust the levels to customize them for your child.  Set the maximum numbers to 5, 10 or 20.  You can also set the timer to see how many problems can be solved within a specific time frame.\n\nKids love the Math Magic app because it’s fun.

Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 1 to 5. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher.\n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n\n• Improve your sense of pulse and metre (feeling the beat).\n\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it or spot differences and mistakes).\n\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n\n• Learn to describe dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Pulse and Metre\n• Echoes\n• Differences\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nTackle each element in stages using the preparation exercises.\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again. The app also features supporting tools including an interval trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

You can have a baby monitor with unlimited gear that can be used anywhere without worrying about a weak WiFi signal.\n\nACTIVITY LOG\nBaby Monitor 3G allows you to check, how often was your baby awake, discover its sleeping patterns and replay sounds from current or any previous monitoring.\n\nNIGHT MODE\nThis feature turns the app into a night mode so you can comfortably check your phone placed on the nightstand even during the night without any unnecessary distraction.\n\nEVERY NOISE\nAre you not sure what the little sound you barely hear is? Sensitize the sound for a moment so you can hear every tiny sound from your baby’s room.\n\nTALK TO YOUR BABY\nSimply press a button and speak. Your child will be always one tap away from you.\n\nLULLABIES\nYou can soothe your baby to sleep by playing them some calming music. Lullabies can be imported from the music library or Baby Dreambox app.\n\nNIGHT LIGHT\nSmart night light with adjustable intensity makes it possible to view your baby, even when it’s dark.\n\nPERSONALISATION\nMake Baby Monitor 3G truly yours. You can set it up with the name of your baby, and the app looks differently depending on whether you have a baby boy or baby girl.\n\nSECURE AND RELIABLE\nReliability and privacy are our biggest concerns. You always know the battery level of the baby station, and stability of the internet connection is carefully monitored. In the unlikely event, something goes amiss, you’re notified immediately.\n\nNote about privacy\nWe respect your privacy and that’s why we do not store any data transferred through Baby Monitor 3G or any personal information. The entire connection is encrypted by industry standard SSL. You can find out more details at babymonitor3G.com/privacy\n\nTo see how video works and find more information, go to http://babymonitor3g.com\n\nPlease send us your feedback to support@tappytaps.com. We love to implement new features based on your ideas!"

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

As you listen your brainwaves fall into step with this inaudible beat, and after several minutes synchronize with the target frequency. \n\nBrain Wave Altered State uses the most advanced multi-stage binaural sequences available, combined with the flexibility to choose from a range of relaxing ambient backgrounds, other audio apps, or your own iTunes Music, allowing your mind you to relax and synchronize with your desired state.  It achieves this using our unique process called Progressive Brainwave Entrainment.\n\n*** Progressive Brainwave Entrainment ***\n\nProgressive Brainwave Entrainment algorithms use layers of frequencies and carrier signals assembled in precise sequences to create profoundly unique experiences.  Each program gently brings your brainwave frequencies to your desired state using a more natural frequency progression.\n\n*** Advanced Features ***\n\n - 20 Brainwave programs each specially designed for a different situation and desired mental state.\n\n - 17 ambient background sounds to choose from.\n\n - Independently adjustable ambient sound volume.\n\n - Visual timer countdown indicator.\n\n - Automatic storage of preferred brainwave program and ambient background.\n\n - Ability to set your own custom program duration.\n\n\n* Programs Included *\n\n - Chakra Meditation:  A series of balanced, meditative brainwave programs each taking you to a different, deeper meditative state, ending in the ultimate state of meditation and calm.\n\n - Euphoric Bliss:  The ultimate brainwave program designed to gently bring your mind through a series of uplifting states, culminating in a state of euphoria and bliss.

      "label": "What’s your personality? How do you and your loved ones, friends, and co-workers compare? Imagine having quick access to the right keywords to get your point across!\n\nWhether you’re in a boring meeting, on the phone with a challenging client, or dealing with a flustered family member — this application is for you. The essential themes of each personality Type are just a tap away. You can also explore each personality in depth: learn a person’s core needs and values, cognitive processes, interaction style, team behavior, pitfalls, growth points, and much more.\n\nYou will quickly learn about Type Theory and how to positively influence others using the “Compare” feature. This feature relies on sophisticated algorithms to show you the likely commonalities, differences, and synergies between two people. The algorithms compare communication, problem solving, learning and adaptation, love relationships, growth and change, and more.\n\nIN DEPTH:\nPersonality is far more than just superficial traits. Personality reveals motivation and cognition — why (and how) people act. In short, this application helps you discover what makes people “tick”. When you know why someone needs something, or how they prefer to go about doing a task or interaction, then you have leverage to improve the situation. \n\nFor almost six decades, thousands of successful professionals — counselors, teachers, managers, coaches, salespeople, and others — have used the insights of Type Theory. Type Theory is supported by decades of published statistical analysis of over six million people.\n\nThe famous and highly respected Dr. Carl Jung first described eight cognitive processes people use. The eight processes combine to match the sixteen personality Types. Thus, when you learn about Type Theory, you learn what occurs on the inside; in a person’s head and heart — and how they relate back-and-forth with others. No other personality theory can give you this picture.\n\nThis application is ideal for serious students of psychology. Learning about ourselves and others is not done by simply “taking a test” that “tells” us who we are. Although we include multiple personality assessments, genuine learning for adults involves continual exploration and reflection. This application gives you tools; you the one who brings the curiosity and patience for discovery.\n\nEXPERTISE:\nThis application is the work of renowned Type Theorist and UCLA lecturer Dario Nardi, PhD, author of numerous books on personality psychology, cognition, neuroscience, and self-leadership. Dr. Nardi has worked with many other experts, including practicing organizational development consultants and psychologists. What you get is the product of many minds and personalities, not just one.\n\nFEATURES:\n•   Save Multiple Personality Assessments and Profiles For Reference\n•   Includes Three Personality Assessments: “Short Form”, “Long Form”, and “Standard-Form”\n•   Essential Details of the Well-Known 16 Personality Types (“ESTJ”, “INFP”, etc) by Isabel Briggs-Myers\n•   Keywords to Apply Subtle Influence on Others\n•   A Super “Compare” Feature to Pinpoint and Manage Commonalities and Differences Between Any Two Personality Types\n•   An Explanation of Type Theory with Links to Handy Online Resources"

You may have stressful job, like manager reporting to executives or customer facing specialist, which makes you feel exhausted at the end of your long day. You may be on emotional rollercoaster as your partner is making your heart tear apart. Or you may simply be curious to know yourself better. This app may help! Bring your iMoodJournal to your therapist or discuss it with your close friend to maximize its positive impact on your life.\n\n* To get the best out of the app, please keep regular records (preferably 2 – 3 times a day) of your mood with tags and self-portraits for at least 1 – 2 weeks. The Weekly Cycle chart requires several weeks of records to generate meaningful output. We wish you the very best experience with iMoodJournal.

Been having trouble getting up. No more!\n √ This app is so easy to use, and has all the perfect functions!

It uses advanced image recognition and step tracking technologies to check whether you’re far away from your bed. \n\nAfter ringing, the app asks you to capture another photo of a specified place, it should be where you usually be every time you wake up, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, ... So you just take a photo and do your routine work like washing your face or preparing breakfast. \n\nAnother alternative is using the step counter, which simplifies this process into just nothing. You wake up and go to wherever you want with the device. After reaching enough number of steps, the alarm will automatically turn off. It’s simply a smarter alarm with no additional action., You’ll love using it from the very first time. \n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n\n- MUSIC ALARM \no Wake up with your favorite songs\no Listen to them when moving\n\n- FULLY FUNCTIONAL ALARM \no Easy setup with hand-drawn mini-game\no Repeating rule for daily, weekly alarms \no Built-in alarm sounds \no Snooze, Vibrate, Fade-in & Volume for the perfect experience \n\n- MOTION TRACKING \no Innovative motion tracking system to sense your steps\no Smart anti-cheat system to make sure that you are stepping\n\n**IMPORTANT: We do not encourage our users to step so fast when you are not totally awake, this app will just recognize the steps when you aren’t walking too fast.\n\n- IMAGE RECOGNITION\no State-of-the-art image recognizing engine\no Can match both horizontal and vertical pictures\no Strict image comparison to assure you’re leaving your bed and your eyes opened wide enough to take the right picture.\n\n**HINT: Choose a scene that has a stable light condition for better matching results.\n\n- SLEEP TIMER \no Fall asleep with music \no Auto-lock and ready for next alarm \n\n- FLASHLIGHT \no Easy to find way through the dark when you are stepping\n\n- CLOCK \no Full feature clock \no Show/hide seconds, 24 hour format, …"

      "label": "Your baby has always been a good sleeper, especially at naptime, but now is suddenly waking halfway through his the nap with a forceful cry. The cry is not the problem but it signals a problem that must be discovered.  The Babywise Nap App is an analysis tool that can help any parent isolate the underlying cause of nap disruptions and sleep disturbances for infants between 2 to 12 months of age. By working through a few basic questions, the App reduces the hundreds of nap disturbance variables down to the most likely causes for a baby's sleep disturbance. Once the list is generated, the app offers the most appropriate solution based on the analysis from the data provided. \r\n\r\nAdapted from the best-selling On Becoming Babywise book, the Babywise Nap App comes with solutions proven successful for millions of children around the world.\r\n\r\nAlong with the analysis feature, parents will find:\r\n\r\n - Basic nap and sleep facts\r\n - How healthy nap habits are developed\r\n - How many naps a day based on baby's age\r\n - How long each nap will be based on baby's age\r\n - Explanations of the most common sleep disturbances\r\n - How food and waketime activities influence nap behavior\r\n - How and when to drop a nap based on baby’s need and age\r\n - How to train a baby to sleep through the night\r\n\r\nThe Babywise Nap App assumes a baby is on a well-established feed-wake-sleep routine, already sleeping through the night a minimum of eight hours, and has already established healthy nap patterns."

With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

      "label": "7 Advanced Binaural Dream Induction Programs in One App!  Dream Inducer combines soothing ambient sounds with powerful binaural sequences to synchronize your brainwaves with frequencies associated with 7 different levels of dreaming. * Universal iOS App for iPhone/Pad * Headphones or Earbuds must be worn for binaural tones to be effective.\n\n* Each program includes a sleep induction phase and then introduces progressively higher frequency Alpha, Beta, and Theta dream sequences to stimulate increasingly vivid dreams.\n\n* To combine Brainwaves and Ambience with Audio from Another App use the 'Ambience + Other App' background mode.\n\n* To use just Brainwaves and Audio from Another App use the \"Other App\" option for the Background Mode.\n\n** How Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Works **\nThrough the process of brainwave entrainment human brainwave frequencies can be synchronized with a  frequency associated with a target mental state.  These Brainwave frequencies are too low for the human ear to hear, however, these low-frequencies can be perceived by the human brain if two different audible frequencies are played separately into each ear with headphones or earbuds.  For example, the human ear can't directly perceive the 2 Hz Delta-wave frequency associated with deep sleep, but if you wear headphones with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 137 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 2 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat.  As you listen, your brainwaves will begin to match that frequency, inducing the associated mental state.\n\nDream Inducer improves upon basic binaural techniques by layering multiple signals and then assembling these into sequences of programs that combine to create extremely unique experiences."

      "label": "Family tree research is becoming an ever more popular past time.  Normally all of your genealogy information is locked away on your computer at home which isn't much use when you are out and about researching local records, or visiting locations such as graveyards, ancestral homes, or family reunions.\n\nThis is where GedView comes in.  Carry around your entire family tree on your iPhone, iPod, or iPad and have all the data about your ancestors and even current descendants at your fingertips.\n\nYou can quickly check up on family relationships, dates / locations of events, and record new information.  Despite the name GedView is not just a viewing tool.  This includes taking photos, or video anywhere and anytime you like without needing to worry about a potentially costly internet connection.   If using an iPhone, or a cellular enabled iPad you can even record your current location to add to any event.\n\nIf your tree contains lots of images you can even use GedView as a slideshow, showing all the pictures related to a given event, person, source, family.  You can also play back any home movies you have in your tree.  Media support is not limited to photos/video.  Support is also included for any other file type your iPhone, iPod, or iPad is capable of opening.  This may be PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, mp3 files.  If you have an app installed that supports a specific document type and have a document of that type in your tree you will be able to view it via GedView.\n\nDo you have some separate branches in your tree that you haven't connected yet?  GedView allows you to store multiple trees so you can easily switch to view distinct branches.\n\nUnlike other apps no specific computer application is required, nor is a subscription to any website.  Instead standard GEDCOM files can be imported,  These can be encoded as ASCII, ANSI, ANSEL, UTF-8, or UTF-16 and can be added to GedView via WiFi, downloading from a website, via iTunes, or even opened from other apps such as Mail, Safari, Dropbox etc.\n\nWhile GedView is targeted towards GEDCOM 5.5.1 it will read in any version, and will also support many custom extensions used by other genealogy applications, and because GEDCOM hasn't been added as an after thought imports are fast and efficient.\n\nYou can even export GEDCOM files for sharing with family members or other researchers, or to transfer new information to your main computer.\n\nA sample family tree containing the British monarchy is included.\n\nIf you have any problems, or suggestions please get in touch via the support email address."

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

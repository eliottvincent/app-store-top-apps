During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly.

Which apps can you use? It depends on what’s been created for you. Here are some examples you might see, or ones you can make yourself using the Power Apps website:\r\n\r\n• Campus app: Map your campus with icons for landmarks and facility details.\r\n• Event registration app: Record attendees as they arrive using barcodes or QR codes.\r\n• Expenses app: Let employees submit their expenses and upload photos of receipts.\r\n• Health clinic app: Let patients check in to appointments with just a few taps.\r\n• NFC reader app: Scan NFC tags on ID cards, equipment, packages, etc.\r\n• Performance app: Visualize data and get insights with interactive dashboards.\r\n• Sales app: See opportunities and leads, review comments, and approve for your P&L.\r\n• Space planning app: Take 3D measurements and manipulate objects in mixed reality.\r\n• Timesheet app: Collect, consolidate, and analyze shift data from employees.\r\n\r\nThis is just a handful of examples; the possibilities are endless. Build and share low-code apps for your work or school at the Power Apps website.\r\n\r\nTIPS\r\n\r\n• Swipe right to make an app a favorite, swipe left to add a shortcut to the home screen.\r\n• As an admin, mark an app as Featured, so that it stays pinned to the top of the apps list.\r\n• Some apps can work offline, and Power Apps will sync your data when you reconnect.\r\n\r\nAccessibility: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121429"

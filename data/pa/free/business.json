Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

Whova exceeds other business card reader apps like CamCard, CardMunch, ScanBizCards or Scannable etc. by automatically building full profiles using Whova's SmartProfile technology. This allows you to gain deep insights into your contacts' professional backgrounds, work experience, passions, and interests. You can also seamlessly connect with contacts online via LinkedIn and other platforms. Whova's business card scanning feature now supports cards in English, Chinese, and Korean.\n\nWhova is SOC2 Type II and PCI compliant.

We no longer have to wander around wondering if we will bump into the person we really would like to meet. “\n\n- “I could see who attended and easily follow up with the people after this entrepreneur/investor event”\n\n- “I have seen other event apps but neither of them provided such valuable information of the attendees. “\n\n- “This app has been fantastic for networking, announcements, agenda, etc., at this one-week conference!”\n\n- “Another great feature of the Whova app is the ability to share slides and documents electronically.”\n\n- \"Whova is an amazing app for keeping track of your connections and storing them in one easy-to-access place.

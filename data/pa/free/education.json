Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa.

      "label": "Gradient keeps track of your current and predicted grades.\n\nEver wonder what score you need on an exam to get an A in the class? Of course you have. Because whether you're acing a class or failing, it feels better to know where you stand. Now you can see what scores you need for the grade you want.\n\nUse Gradient to record your current grades –– and predict your final grades based on assignments that you have yet to complete. \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Set parameters for a course you want to track: things like grading scale and whether certain sections of the course are weighted differently.\n2. Enter scores for assignments you've completed ... and enter predicted scores for assignments you haven't done yet.\n3. As you complete coursework, mark predicted assignments as \"completed\" and adjust your scores accordingly.\n4. Keep up with your Gradient and experiment with predicted scores. The goal is all green!\n\nTechnical mumbo-jumbo:\nAll grades are calculated using numbers rounded to three decimal places. The percent value shown for grades does not display decimals. This is just to save space. The values are truncated, NOT rounded. For example, an 87.4 and an 87.5 will both show up as an 87. The letter grade depends on the grade scale you set. So, if you set a B+ as an 87.5, an 87.5 would show up as a B+ and an 87.4 would show up as a B.\n\nPlease send questions, suggestions, and comments to: GradientGrades@gmail.com."

      "label": "Welcome to \"Lila's World\" \n\nPlay as Lila while she visits her Grandma's house for the summer. There are a lot of things to discover all throughout this mystery manor in which Grandma lives. Explore the house, read a book in the library or have a tea party in the living room. Play the piano in the Music room or Cook almost any dish you can think of in the Kitchen. While you explore, don’t forget to look for the many secrets of the house. Now what could Grandma be hiding?\n\nNot only can you play in Grandma's house but you can draw and create your own worlds too. Use real paper and colors to draw new characters, scenes, food, objects and a lot more. \n\nBrowse all the different worlds created by all the imaginative kids out there. The possibilities are endless. \n\nMaybe you can help Lila setup her cousin Ro's birthday party, or go to the park for a picnic with her friends. \n\nMaybe you can sail the oceans on a pirate ship, or just have fun day at the beach with your family.\n\nYou can also play with your own drawn characters in the real world in the AR mode. Just watch as your own drawings come to life. It’s like Magic!\n\nMake your own pretend play world!\n\nPLAY:\nIn “Lila’s Word” there are no rules and no goals. Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

      "label": "iNaturalist is a social network for sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. The primary goal is to connect people to nature, and the secondary goal is to generate scientifically valuable biodiversity data from these personal encounters. \n\niNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals with visually similar suggestions and verification by dedicated contributors. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you'll create research-quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n• Identification suggestions: Take or import a photo and view the top 10 most visually similar species matches and tap through to get more information. You can view these suggestions even before creating an account.\n• Feedback from our community: Create an account to share your observations and start a conversation about what you saw. Can’t identify the organism? Start with a broad identification like “plants” or “fungi” so others with more expertise can find it and refine the identification. \n• Keep a record of all living things: Build your life list by posting to iNaturalist. Where, when, and what you saw is the basis of each observation you create.\n• Grounded in science: Every identification is connected to the tree of life, which means you can search for broad classifications like “Ferns” or “Fungi” as well as species-level identifications like “Humpback Whale” (and everything in between). \n• Advancing science & conservation: Millions of observations created and identified by the iNaturalist community are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility where they are used to advance scientific understanding of biodiversity through open data and open science. \n• Enabling citizen science and community science: Join any of the tens of thousands of projects around the world on iNaturalist to draw attention to and collect data about particular species or places.\n• Not-for-profit: iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, both 501(c)3 nonprofits in the United States. iNaturalist is free for anyone to use thanks to the generous support of many organizations and individuals. Thank you!\n• No hidden charges: This app is truly free because we believe nature is for everyone.\n• Best for wild plants and animals: The iNaturalist community is better at identifying wild plants and animals than those in gardens or horticulture. Get outside and find what’s wild!\n• Control how your location is shared: Set the privacy to obscured (only general location is shared) or private (no location is shared at all, but much harder for others to help identify). The locations of species at risk from disturbance are automatically obscured.\n• More than a mobile app: iNaturalist has even more extensive features and tools for learning and exploration. Get the full experience at inaturalist.org!\n• 35+ languages: iNaturalist has been translated into dozens of languages thanks to multilingual enthusiasts who want to see the community grow.\n• A global network: iNaturalist is used in every country on earth! In many countries, we have formal agreements with local organizations to promote iNaturalist. Use this app for contributing to all iNaturalist Network sites, including Naturalista (Mexico and Colombia), iNaturalist.NZ (New Zealand), iNaturalist.ca (Canada), Biodiversity4All (Portugal), iNaturalistAU (Australia), iNaturalistPa (Panama), iNaturalistEc (Ecuador), ArgentiNat (Argentina), iNaturalistil (Israel), and iNaturalistFi (Suomi/Finland)."

Now you can learn through song – scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn how to speak a new language!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nHow does the Univoice app work?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**No singing skill required!

Get a map, turn-by-turn directions to exhibits and amenities, customized recommendations for what to see, and more! \n \n“A great aid to anyone seeing the museum for the first or 40th time.” - The New York Times\n \nAvailable in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Explorer is automatically set to the language of your device.\n \nMap and Turn-by-Turn Directions\nGet directions to exhibits and amenities, including shortest and accessible routes.\n \nGet Recommendations for What to See\nExplorer recommends exhibits based on interests you select—and sorts them by how close they are to your location.\n \nLearn More About the Museum’s Exhibits \nGo behind the scenes and dive deeper with videos, fun quizzes, and more.\n \nFind the Nearest Restroom \nExplorer provides you the shortest route to restrooms, shops, exits, and more.\n\nHow does Explorer know where you are? The Museum has placed more than 700 Bluetooth beacons throughout its 45 permanent halls. These tiny beacons give off signals that your phone can detect (when Bluetooth is enabled). Your phone calculates your position based on detecting three of these beacons simultaneously. This triangulation is not always perfect, especially in certain areas like large, multi-level halls, meandering walkways, or stairwells. Your phone should be able to detect the hall that you are in and provide turn-by-turn directions, but sometimes the “blue dot” is not exactly in the right place. In some rare cases it will even be missing. Moving to another area and waiting a few moments will usually fix the issue.\n\nThe Museum’s free AMNH-GUEST Wi-Fi also varies in strength throughout the complex. Certain materials and large exhibits (i.e. the Blue Whale) either absorb or reflect the radio signals used by Wi-Fi, further complicating this technology. If you experience difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi in a particular part of the Museum, you can usually fix the issue by moving a short distance away.\n \nWe’d Love to Hear From You!\nYour feedback is important and will help us improve your Museum experience. Email explorer@amnh.org.\n \nSupported by\nBloomberg Philanthropies"

Because whether you're acing a class or failing, it feels better to know where you stand. Now you can see what scores you need for the grade you want.\n\nUse Gradient to record your current grades –– and predict your final grades based on assignments that you have yet to complete. \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Set parameters for a course you want to track: things like grading scale and whether certain sections of the course are weighted differently.\n2. Enter scores for assignments you've completed ... and enter predicted scores for assignments you haven't done yet.\n3. As you complete coursework, mark predicted assignments as \"completed\" and adjust your scores accordingly.\n4. Keep up with your Gradient and experiment with predicted scores. The goal is all green!\n\nTechnical mumbo-jumbo:\nAll grades are calculated using numbers rounded to three decimal places. The percent value shown for grades does not display decimals. This is just to save space. The values are truncated, NOT rounded. For example, an 87.4 and an 87.5 will both show up as an 87. The letter grade depends on the grade scale you set. So, if you set a B+ as an 87.5, an 87.5 would show up as a B+ and an 87.4 would show up as a B.\n\nPlease send questions, suggestions, and comments to: GradientGrades@gmail.com."

      "label": "iNaturalist is a social network for sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. The primary goal is to connect people to nature, and the secondary goal is to generate scientifically valuable biodiversity data from these personal encounters. \n\niNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals with visually similar suggestions and verification by dedicated contributors. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you'll create research-quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n• Identification suggestions: Take or import a photo and view the top 10 most visually similar species matches and tap through to get more information. You can view these suggestions even before creating an account.\n• Feedback from our community: Create an account to share your observations and start a conversation about what you saw. Can’t identify the organism? Start with a broad identification like “plants” or “fungi” so others with more expertise can find it and refine the identification. \n• Keep a record of all living things: Build your life list by posting to iNaturalist. Where, when, and what you saw is the basis of each observation you create.\n• Grounded in science: Every identification is connected to the tree of life, which means you can search for broad classifications like “Ferns” or “Fungi” as well as species-level identifications like “Humpback Whale” (and everything in between). \n• Advancing science & conservation: Millions of observations created and identified by the iNaturalist community are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility where they are used to advance scientific understanding of biodiversity through open data and open science. \n• Enabling citizen science and community science: Join any of the tens of thousands of projects around the world on iNaturalist to draw attention to and collect data about particular species or places.\n• Not-for-profit: iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, both 501(c)3 nonprofits in the United States. iNaturalist is free for anyone to use thanks to the generous support of many organizations and individuals. Thank you!\n• No hidden charges: This app is truly free because we believe nature is for everyone.\n• Best for wild plants and animals: The iNaturalist community is better at identifying wild plants and animals than those in gardens or horticulture. Get outside and find what’s wild!\n• Control how your location is shared: Set the privacy to obscured (only general location is shared) or private (no location is shared at all, but much harder for others to help identify). The locations of species at risk from disturbance are automatically obscured.\n• More than a mobile app: iNaturalist has even more extensive features and tools for learning and exploration. Get the full experience at inaturalist.org!\n• 35+ languages: iNaturalist has been translated into dozens of languages thanks to multilingual enthusiasts who want to see the community grow.\n• A global network: iNaturalist is used in every country on earth! In many countries, we have formal agreements with local organizations to promote iNaturalist. Use this app for contributing to all iNaturalist Network sites, including Naturalista (Mexico and Colombia), iNaturalist.NZ (New Zealand), iNaturalist.ca (Canada), Biodiversity4All (Portugal), iNaturalistAU (Australia), iNaturalistPa (Panama), iNaturalistEc (Ecuador), ArgentiNat (Argentina), iNaturalistil (Israel), and iNaturalistFi (Suomi/Finland)."

Pueden realizar consultas a los expertos durante toda la experiencia y al final de cada tema y mes realizar un post test que busca demostrar el progreso en los conocimientos y prácticas adquiridos.\r\n\nDentro del App hay una sala de eventos para que durante el mes se vean también las charlas en vivo por parte de los expertos encargados de cada tema. Los temas a trabajar son: Salud Física, Salud Emocional, Salud Financiera, Propósito de Vida, Productividad Personal e Integrando mi Experiencia vivir al 100%.\n\n\r\nUna vez las personas entran van ganando puntos a medida que van avanzando en cada uno de los pasos que el App te pide. Dentro del muro común también se pueden observar los puntos que cada persona gana y los puntos que va ganando la Empresa también por departamento. De esta manera se puede motivar a cada Empresa a generar una dinámica interna para procurar ganar incrementando la motivación de su personal y familia hacia una cultura de Salud y Bienestar Integral. \n\n\r\nUna Vez completada la Experiencia las Empresas ganadoras serán reconocidas en un evento de cierre donde se otorgarán reconocimientos a las Empresas que hayan obtenido mas puntos. \n\n\r\nLas Empresas pueden ver también sus reportes integrando los demográficos con los resultados de sus pruebas para ver de forma masiva también el progreso de sus participantes, incluyendo una serie de información social que les puede ayudar a generar acciones de mejora y a nosotros como centro de investigación proponer también acciones de mejora a nivel individual, empresarial, comunitario y"

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain.

Because whether you're acing a class or failing, it feels better to know where you stand. Now you can see what scores you need for the grade you want.\n\nUse Gradient to record your current grades –– and predict your final grades based on assignments that you have yet to complete. \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Set parameters for a course you want to track: things like grading scale and whether certain sections of the course are weighted differently.\n2. Enter scores for assignments you've completed ... and enter predicted scores for assignments you haven't done yet.\n3. As you complete coursework, mark predicted assignments as \"completed\" and adjust your scores accordingly.\n4. Keep up with your Gradient and experiment with predicted scores. The goal is all green!\n\nTechnical mumbo-jumbo:\nAll grades are calculated using numbers rounded to three decimal places. The percent value shown for grades does not display decimals. This is just to save space. The values are truncated, NOT rounded. For example, an 87.4 and an 87.5 will both show up as an 87. The letter grade depends on the grade scale you set. So, if you set a B+ as an 87.5, an 87.5 would show up as a B+ and an 87.4 would show up as a B.\n\nPlease send questions, suggestions, and comments to: GradientGrades@gmail.com."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

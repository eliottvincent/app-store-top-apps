Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

Hemos creado el SISTEMA DE ENSEÑANZA DE LA GRAMÁTICA más claro y sencillo, conveniente a los principiantes.

Descompusimos el inglés en átomos, seleccionamos solo la info más relevante, la reconstituimos y convertimos en estructuras fáciles e inteligibles. Cada regla gramatical del curso autodidacta Simpler es una instrucción corta que enseguida se refuerza con preguntas y prácticas.\n\n2. Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado. Le harán pensar en inglés, con ellas podrá ampliar su vocabulario y mejorar la destreza oral.\n\n6. ¡La eficacia está en la regularidad! Para mantener su motivación a aprender inglés, hacemos constancia de su TRABAJO A TODO RITMO. ¡Estudie todos los días y los resultados no se harán esperar!\n\n7. ¡Gane ESTRELLAS, desbloquee lecciones, trabaje a destajo y reciba regalos!\n\n==========================\n\nOPCIONES DE USO DEL CURSO AUTODIDACTA DE INGLÉS SIMPLER\n• La suscripción Premium le permite aprender inglés accediendo a todo el funcional de la app.\n• Después de confirmar la compra, el cargo se realizará desde su cuenta iTunes. \n• La suscripción se renovará automáticamente a no ser desactivada 24 horas antes del vencimiento del periodo actual.

You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York.

There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go. Each conversation takes no more than 3 minutes and will fit into even the busiest of schedules.\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY\n\nYou’ll learn 6,000 of the most common words everyone needs to travel, work, and communicate in a foreign language. Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

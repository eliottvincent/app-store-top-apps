Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n• 2019 PCMag Editors’ Choice\n• 2019 Tabby Awards Winner\n• 2019 Best Mobile App Awards: Best Designed App and Best Overall App\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next.

Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado.

Because whether you're acing a class or failing, it feels better to know where you stand. Now you can see what scores you need for the grade you want.\n\nUse Gradient to record your current grades –– and predict your final grades based on assignments that you have yet to complete. \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Set parameters for a course you want to track: things like grading scale and whether certain sections of the course are weighted differently.\n2. Enter scores for assignments you've completed ... and enter predicted scores for assignments you haven't done yet.\n3. As you complete coursework, mark predicted assignments as \"completed\" and adjust your scores accordingly.\n4. Keep up with your Gradient and experiment with predicted scores. The goal is all green!\n\nTechnical mumbo-jumbo:\nAll grades are calculated using numbers rounded to three decimal places. The percent value shown for grades does not display decimals. This is just to save space. The values are truncated, NOT rounded. For example, an 87.4 and an 87.5 will both show up as an 87. The letter grade depends on the grade scale you set. So, if you set a B+ as an 87.5, an 87.5 would show up as a B+ and an 87.4 would show up as a B.\n\nPlease send questions, suggestions, and comments to: GradientGrades@gmail.com."

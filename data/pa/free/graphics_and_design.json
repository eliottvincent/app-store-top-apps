Color scheme by Itten is typically used by artists, and RGB is designed for online use. For both of them you can apply one of the 10 color combinations \\ harmonies.\n\nAbility to extract colors from your image\nSelect the desired picture from your phone and application's algorithms will extract colors. Then  you can choose favorite colors and save the palette.\n\nGet matching colors to your custom color\nJust type in your color code and discover color harmonies with this particular color.\n\nUse color editing tool\nIt is very important to balance the quantitative ratio of color in order to make your palette look harmonious in practice. The application has a convenient function to quickly swap colors in the images. There are 3 pictures and gradient in the palette editing carousel. You can see how the selected colors look in different ratios. \n\nEasy to manage and share\nAlso you will be able to save, export and remove palettes. To share the desired palette just choose mode — text HEX codes or image. You can always copy a particular color code under color swatch to the clipboard.\n\nDeveloping Color Gear we tried to make it professional and easy to use.

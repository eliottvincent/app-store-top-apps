It's a simple but powerful music creation tool that caters your need of writing music on the go. \n\n*** The app's user experience is completely optimized to make composing music on mobile devices easier and faster than ever. No more \"tapping and zooming\" the screen just to add a music note or a chord symbol. No more \"dragging and dropping\" from the palette just to add a sharp/flat sign. All you need to do to write a song is just tapping the keyboards (notes and chords) that are designed like a text keyboard. COMPOSING MUSIC IS NOW AS SIMPLE AS TEXTING TO YOUR FRIENDS! \n\n*** Apart from being a songwriting app for songwriters, Score Creator also functions as a music teaching and learning assistant tool for music teachers and students. Teachers can teach students how to read music notation by directly entering music notes into the app and playing back the song, while music students can practice by themselves by notating their favorite songs into the app and playing along with their own music instruments. \n\n*** The app is a perfect tool for writing different types of sheet music, including lead sheet, solo instruments, SATB choir, sheet for brass & woodwind bands, ... \n\n*** FEATURES: \n- Compose music score. The app supports treble, alto, bass and neutral clefs, with a wide range of notes and music symbols: note length, time signature, key signature, slurs, ties, dynamics, articulations & ornaments, ... \n- Write lyrics. \n- Write chord symbols. \n- Multiple tracks with different instruments: piano, guitar, violin, saxophone, drum, flute, horn, tuba, ukulele, mandolin, ...\n- Score for transposing instruments: saxophone (soprano, alto, tenor, baritone), Bb clarinet, Bb trumpet, ... \n- Playback sound for each instrument. \n- Transpose songs into any key. \n- Import songs from MIDI & MusicXML files. \n- Change clef, time/key signature and tempo in the middle of a song.\n- Export songs to MIDI or MusicXML files so that they can be imported into other apps such as Finale, Encore, MuseScore, Sibelius, ... The files can be copied to your computer or sent via email. \n- Send exported MIDI files to other apps on your current device. \n- Import MIDI files from other apps. \n- Export songs to PDF files. \n- Export songs to audio files (.wav, .mp3).\n- Editing assistant features: multiple selecting notes, copy & paste, undo & redo, ... \n- iCloud storage.\n\n*** End User License Agreement: https://www.termsfeed.com/eula/c6cf438c81097acbfd5a7d51600b6bba\n\n*** Privacy policy: The app does not collect or store any kind of personal information."

Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance.  \n\nThis set of widgets can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define.  For example, a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your work day, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day.  This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\nActivity widgets require a paired Apple Watch\n\nThe app itself also includes a wide collection of tools, such as a weather app, a timezone converter, a calendar.  These tools can automatically launch based on the active widget tapped.\n\nNotes:\n • Widgetsmith optionally integrates with Apple Health.  This data is used to display your step and activity if you select one of those widget types.  Permission for Widgetsmith to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.  \n• Widgetsmith includes an optional premium subscription.  This is offered on a monthly or annual basis.  If you choose to purchase a subscription your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\n• Access to Tide and Weather hosted data is only available to Widgetsmith Premium subscribers.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith_privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith-terms-of-use.html"

      "label": "MEGA provides user-controlled encrypted cloud storage that’s accessed with web browsers and dedicated apps for mobile devices. Unlike other cloud storage providers, your data is encrypted and decrypted by your client devices only and never by us.\n\nUpload files from your smartphone or tablet, then search, store, download, stream, view, share, rename or delete them any time, from any device, anywhere. Share folders with your contacts and see their updates in real time.\n\nMEGA’s strong and secure end-to-end encryption means we cannot access or reset your password. You MUST remember your password and make sure to back up your account Recovery Key. Losing your password and the account Recovery Key will result in lost access to your files.\n\nUse the included MEGA Secure Chat for end-to-end-encrypted communications, including video and audio calls, with total privacy. Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency. The code of our iOS mobile app is located at: https://github.com/meganz/ios\n\nSubscriptions renew automatically for successive periods of the same duration at the same price as the initial period chosen. You can cancel the automatic renewal of your MEGA Pro subscription no later than 24 hours before your next subscription payment is due, via your iTunes account settings page. To manage your subscriptions, tap on the App Store icon on your device, sign in with your Apple ID at the bottom of the page (if you haven’t already done so) and then tap View ID. You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions. From there, you can select your MEGA Pro subscription and view your scheduled renewal date, choose a different subscription package or toggle the on-off switch to off to disable the auto-renewal of your subscription.\n\nTerms of Service: https://mega.io/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://mega.io/privacy"

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

We organize all your mailing lists in one spot, so it’s easy to unsubscribe from noisy newsletters and promos with a quick tap. \n\n• Organize and navigate your inbox with ease\nFind what you need fast with inbox filters that sort your emails by attachments, starred, unread, and more.

This view organizes your inbox around your favorite stores and the categories you shop. Now, find all your favorite deals—without the clutter.\n\n• Keep tabs on your free trials\nGet reminders before free trials expire—so you can update your subscription plan or cancel before the subscription trial ends. \n\n• Customize your notifications\nChoose which notifications you really need and say bye-bye to the ones you don't. You can turn on alerts for emails from people, bills & receipts, deals, travel, reminders or general messages. \n\n• Connect your other accounts\nBring your Gmail, AOL, or Microsoft accounts and take advantage of extra features. Set your own swipe actions, change up the sounds or swap in your favorite color. (We like purple)\n\n• Accessibility\nMaking sure our products are accessible is a priority.

Zero-log policy, traffic encryption, IP and DNS masking. These all mean that third parties are not able to monitor you any longer, and that your privacy is reliably secured from obtrusive website and ISP surveillance.\n\n+70 LOCATIONS\nOur high-speed VPN servers in 70+ locations all over the globe, as well as our enhanced KeepSolid Wise technology, allow you to freely surf the web without giving out a single piece of your personal information, including your current location.

Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. All costs for subscriptions are mentioned above.\n\nPrivacy policies : https://luni.app/support/vpn_privacy\nTerms of use : https://luni.app/support/vpn_terms\n\nDisclaimer: We have had reports that our VPN service might be blocked in the countries listed below:\n- China\n- UAE\n- Saudi Arabia\n- Iraq\n- Iran\n- Turkmenistan\n- Turkey\n\nWhile we can’t say that it’s totally impossible to connect in the mentioned locations, there are a few challenges to overcome."

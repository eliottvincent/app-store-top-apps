It’s the personal basketball trainer that’s always with you, capturing your performance, your stats, and your progress—guiding you to the next level. With HomeCourt, every rep counts. \n\nTRAIN SMARTER\nHomeCourt captures your moves and your stats as you train—so you can see your true skill level. HomeCourt uses the camera on your device to track your performance in real-time, everything from your jump shot to your crossover. In-depth data and analytics help you break down every session. HomeCourt calculates metrics like shooting percentage, accuracy, release time, dribble speed, vertical jump and more.

You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad. No special basketballs, uncomfortable sensors, or expensive equipment is required. Just set up your phone with a clear view of the court and starting training and competing through HomeCourt.\n\nPRICING\n• Free: Access the full library of 100+ drills and activities. Get unlimited shot tracking.\n• HomeCourt Plus: Access your full workout history, get complete skill ratings, join the members-only training club, request feedback from HomeCourt pro trainers, participate in HomeCourt Global Camp, and create up to 4 user profiles.\n\nHomeCourt Plus is available for subscription as either monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions.

      "label": "The ArmCare App is designed to be used with the ArmCare Strength Sensor. \n\nArmCare Technology uses your strength, fatigue and recovery data to individualize training and unlock the potential for huge velocity gains.\n\nGone are the days of using the same arm care band routine. The future is knowing where you are weak, how your arm fatigues and if you are recovering optimally between outings. \n\nThousands of players and over 20 MLB teams are using the ArmCare technology to monitor arm health and velocity.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n1. MEASURE YOUR STRENGTH\nUsing  the ArmCare Sensor, accurately measure the strength & range of motion of your arm in 5 minutes…with no assistance needed.\n\n2. CHECK YOUR KEY METRICS\nStrength, Fatigue, Recovery are used to individualize throwing programs, bullpens, pitch counts, velocity programs, pitch design & mechanics\n\n3. ARMCARE OPTIMIZED FOR YOU\nThe app prescribes customized arm care programs to attack your weak links. You know exactly what training to do to get results fast\n\nBENEFITS\n- Players will get real metrics on their rotator cuff strength the same way a bat sensor helps dial in swing path and launch angle.\n\n- Players will receive custom arm care programs everyday to help strengthen their weak links, rather than a one size fits all program.\n\n- Each player will know exactly what to do to keep his arm feeling fresh and strong all season long.\n\nNo Medical Advice:\n\n- The Program provides general information only and does not constitute providing medical or health care services of any kind, nor engagement in human subjects research.\n- The information provided in the Program is not medical advice and should not be treated as such.\n\nArm Care subscription Premium:\n\nArm Care plans:\n\nAnnual: $45.99\nPayments and Renewal:\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\nYou can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\nNo cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active period.\n\nTerms of use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy policy: https://armcare.com/privacy-policy/"

No credit card required.\n\nAthletes: CoachNow is 100% FREE for athletes and parents to use. Please follow your coaches instructions before creating an account.\n\n\nCOACHING COMMUNICATION FEATURES\n\nThink of CoachNow as a One-Stop-Shop for all your coaching needs.\n\nCreate private “Spaces” with your individual athletes. There you can create posts, analyze videos, and give feedback in a secure, private channel dedicated solely to your athlete's improvement.\n\nCoaching a team or group of athletes? \"Groups\" are like Spaces, but designed with features that support a team environment. Within \"Groups\", create channels of common topics (e.g. \"Scheduling\", \"Game day Plans\", \"Team Goals\"), allowing your whole team to easily communicate and achieve their goals faster than ever.\n\nQuickly Post or Reply in a “Space” or “Group” with Videos, Images, Audio, Text, Spreadsheets, Documents, and more – all easily accessible, right when you need them.\n\nEasily reuse all past documents, videos, and photos with your personal Cloud Library. All paid plans include Cloud Storage.\n\n\nVIDEO AND IMAGE ANALYSIS FEATURES\n\nAccess the Video Analysis Tools directly in an athlete Space or Group.\n\nWhen creating a post, you can shoot a new video, re-use a video from your Personal CoachNow library, or upload one from your camera roll.\n\nAdd context to your feedback with built-in Voice Over. Add your voice to any video or photo to add more context to your training. Using this feature is an easy, fast, and potent way to deliver high-value coaching feedback in a high-touch way.\n\nFilm at 240 fps and use the Slow Motion Feature to break down every movement and deliver feedback with pinpoint accuracy every time.\n\nEliminate confusion with dynamic annotation tools. Use angles, shapes, timers, etc to provide technical feedback and keep your athlete hyper-aware of their form.\n\nCompare your athletes side-by-side with Comparison Shots. Seeing two shots side by side gives a far more dynamic and insightful look than a single shot.\n\n\nMEMBERSHIPS\n\nCoachNow Free\n\nOur Free version for Athletes and their support.

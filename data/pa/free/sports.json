In contrast to other apps on the market, we have speciallized in creating a tournament generator that can handle low, high or uneven number of players.\n\nTHE SCORING SYSTEM\nBased on a predetermined number of points per game (e.g. 21 points) the team that takes the most number of points will be the winner of the match. This also means that being the winner or loser of the match is irrelevant. The reason for this is that each point counts in your individual results. As a player you should always aim to get as many points as possible, it will not be the same to win 20 to 1 than 11 to 10.\n\nHOW TO WIN IN AMERICANO\nTo become the winner of the Padel Americano you have to not only rely on your technical and tactical skills, but also a high level of adaption and coordination with your different teammates throughout the tournament.\n\n\nTerms of Use (EULA):\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

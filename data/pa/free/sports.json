It’s the personal basketball trainer that’s always with you, capturing your performance, your stats, and your progress—guiding you to the next level. With HomeCourt, every rep counts. \n\nTRAIN SMARTER\nHomeCourt captures your moves and your stats as you train—so you can see your true skill level. HomeCourt uses the camera on your device to track your performance in real-time, everything from your jump shot to your crossover. In-depth data and analytics help you break down every session.

You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad. No special basketballs, uncomfortable sensors, or expensive equipment is required.

Get unlimited shot tracking.\n• HomeCourt Plus: Access your full workout history, get complete skill ratings, join the members-only training club, request feedback from HomeCourt pro trainers, participate in HomeCourt Global Camp, and create up to 4 user profiles.\n\nHomeCourt Plus is available for subscription as either monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions.

Sin embargo, éstos ignoran las capacidades y diferencias individuales de cada persona. Esta falta de adaptación y personalización puede hacer que, por mucho que le dediques no consigas tus objetivos. O lo que es mucho peor, te ponen en una situación de riesgo de lesión o en situaciones de riesgo para la salud. \n\nEl contacto permanente entre runner y entrenador va a permitir que el entrenamiento “sea algo vivo”. \n\nLos entrenamientos personalizados están orientados a carreras de 10k, ½ Maratón y Maratón. Además, en el Reto de Correr podemos ayudarte con la preparación de cualquier otra disciplina o distancia que quieras afrontar. \n\nDel mismo modo, si eres un runner o atleta con experiencia que entrenas con regularidad, te ofrecemos la posibilidad de planificar tu temporada de forma continua y con distintos objetivos a lo largo de la misma."

      "label": "BJJ Logbook is the best and most entertaining way to record your BJJ journey! \n\nSimply download the app, start logging, and enjoy the benefits: \n\n1.\tRetain more details from training\n2.\tImprove faster\n3.\tNever forget an important date\n4.\tTrack your statistics\n\nWe know we should keep a journal of our Jiu Jitsu training, but it's inconvenient to drag a paper notebook to the academy. Who has room for a paper notebook in their bag?\n\nUnlike a paper notebook, BJJ Logbook is always with you because your phone is always with you. This app makes keeping a BJJ journal easy.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nAfter training (or a competition, or a promotion), open the app. Hit the “add a log entry” button and go through the streamlined process of adding an entry. Most of the important details are pre-filled for speed. You can make entries for gi training, nogi training, open mat, etc. Most things can be added by clicking and scrolling, but there are several fields that capture text input. So, write as much or as little as you want.\n\nCOOL BJJ LOGBOOK FEATURES\n\n* “Home” tab displays your training totals for the week, month, and year. You can also start a log entry right from the Home tab.\n\n* “Stats” tab has three pages. Page one has stats for your entire BJJ career. Page two tracks your competition record – your whole competition record is summarized here. Finally, page three shows your belt progress. At a glance, you can see how long you spent at every belt and how long you’ve been at your current belt!\n\n* “Logbook” tab contains all your log entries – training, competitions, and promotions. From here, you can view, edit, add, or delete log entries. \n\n* Cloud Storage - your log entries are stored in the cloud. If you lose your phone, you won't lose your logbook. Simply log into BJJ Logbook on another iOS device and get instant access to your logbook. This also means you can use BJJ Logbook with multiple devices. Make an entry on your iPhone and review it later on your iPad. BJJ Logbook gives you great flexibility to log entries with all your compatible iOS devices.\n\nYou spend a lot of time and effort training Jiu Jitsu. Make sure you take a small amount of time to capture all the important details. Your mind may forget, but BJJ Logbook will not.\n\nIf you need more information, go to https://bjjlogbook.com\n\nWe hope you love using our app! If you do, please consider leaving a review.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or feedback for our team, please contact us at https://bjjlogbook.com/contact-us"

In contrast to other apps on the market, we have speciallized in creating a tournament generator that can handle low, high or uneven number of players.\n\nTHE SCORING SYSTEM\nBased on a predetermined number of points per game (e.g. 21 points) the team that takes the most number of points will be the winner of the match. This also means that being the winner or loser of the match is irrelevant. The reason for this is that each point counts in your individual results. As a player you should always aim to get as many points as possible, it will not be the same to win 20 to 1 than 11 to 10.\n\nHOW TO WIN IN AMERICANO\nTo become the winner of the Padel Americano you have to not only rely on your technical and tactical skills, but also a high level of adaption and coordination with your different teammates throughout the tournament.\n\n\nTerms of Use (EULA):\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "CoachNow was built for coaches, by coaches.\n\nWe designed the platform to not only deliver state-of-the-art-video analysis features, but also a private communication channel and contact database for individual and group coaching.\n\nIf you're a Coach looking to unlock your TIME, increase your income, and coach wherever you are in the world, we'd love to have you on board.\n\nCoaches: Download the app today to begin your FREE 7-day CoachNow PRO trial. No credit card required.\n\nAthletes: CoachNow is 100% FREE for athletes and parents to use. Please follow your coaches instructions before creating an account.\n\n\nCOACHING COMMUNICATION FEATURES\n\nThink of CoachNow as a One-Stop-Shop for all your coaching needs.\n\nCreate private “Spaces” with your individual athletes. There you can create posts, analyze videos, and give feedback in a secure, private channel dedicated solely to your athlete's improvement.\n\nCoaching a team or group of athletes? \"Groups\" are like Spaces, but designed with features that support a team environment. Within \"Groups\", create channels of common topics (e.g. \"Scheduling\", \"Game day Plans\", \"Team Goals\"), allowing your whole team to easily communicate and achieve their goals faster than ever.\n\nQuickly Post or Reply in a “Space” or “Group” with Videos, Images, Audio, Text, Spreadsheets, Documents, and more – all easily accessible, right when you need them.\n\nEasily reuse all past documents, videos, and photos with your personal Cloud Library. All paid plans include Cloud Storage.\n\n\nVIDEO AND IMAGE ANALYSIS FEATURES\n\nAccess the Video Analysis Tools directly in an athlete Space or Group.\n\nWhen creating a post, you can shoot a new video, re-use a video from your Personal CoachNow library, or upload one from your camera roll.\n\nAdd context to your feedback with built-in Voice Over. Add your voice to any video or photo to add more context to your training. Using this feature is an easy, fast, and potent way to deliver high-value coaching feedback in a high-touch way.\n\nFilm at 240 fps and use the Slow Motion Feature to break down every movement and deliver feedback with pinpoint accuracy every time.\n\nEliminate confusion with dynamic annotation tools. Use angles, shapes, timers, etc to provide technical feedback and keep your athlete hyper-aware of their form.\n\nCompare your athletes side-by-side with Comparison Shots. Seeing two shots side by side gives a far more dynamic and insightful look than a single shot.\n\n\nMEMBERSHIPS\n\nCoachNow Free\n\nOur Free version for Athletes and their support. Athletes and their parents never pay a dime to use CoachNow. Contact your coach for more information\n\n\nCoachNow+\n\nOur Intro membership for Coaches, Trainers, and Academies.

      "label": "The Strikeman app allows users to practice their shooting skills without the need for real ammunition. Using our laser bullet, target and smart phone mount, the app records the target and records the users shot scores based on where the laser hit the target.\n \nThe app is composed of 3 sections:\n \nSection 1 – Training\nThe training section is the initial area of the app where the user can practice their shooting skills. Upon beginning a session, a warning screen is shown to ensure that proper firearm safety is taking place before beginning a session. Once the user agrees, the target appears on the screen. The user calibrates the screen to the target by using two fingers to cover the circumference of the target. Then, the distance from the target is selected and they can begin shooting. Each shot from the firearm triggers a laser, which emits a laser strike on the target, and the app records the score. Shooting metrics appear on the screen to show the user how they are doing during the session. This is accompanied by audio. Once the session is complete, all shots will be shown on the target and saved into an archive.\n \nSection 2 – History\nThe history section provides screenshots, shooting metrics, and graphs for the user to track their progress. This includes average score, average range, total shots and total sessions. The information is presented on a histogram and a pie chart. This information is saved in an archive. \n \nSection 3 – Settings\nThe settings section allows the user to turn on/off gun shot audio and voice feedback. Users can toggle the distance metric, selecting either feet or yards. They can also report an issue if the app isn’t working correctly. The App provides access to the initial tutorial to ensure that all safety precautions are being taken.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.strikeman.io/pages/ios-privacy-page\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

In contrast to other apps on the market, we have speciallized in creating a tournament generator that can handle low, high or uneven number of players.\n\nTHE SCORING SYSTEM\nBased on a predetermined number of points per game (e.g. 21 points) the team that takes the most number of points will be the winner of the match. This also means that being the winner or loser of the match is irrelevant. The reason for this is that each point counts in your individual results. As a player you should always aim to get as many points as possible, it will not be the same to win 20 to 1 than 11 to 10.\n\nHOW TO WIN IN AMERICANO\nTo become the winner of the Padel Americano you have to not only rely on your technical and tactical skills, but also a high level of adaption and coordination with your different teammates throughout the tournament.\n\n\nTerms of Use (EULA):\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

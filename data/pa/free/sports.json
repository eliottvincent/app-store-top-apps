      "label": "The latest and greatest mobile app! Completely build on the newest SwiftUI code base with the best graphics out there to run/host both your Survivor and/or Pick'em football pools.\n\nSurvivor pools (also known as Suicide, Eliminator, Knockout, Last Man Standing, or King of the Hill pools) are becoming more popular every year. Although players only pick one team per week, the work involved with running a Survivor pool manually can quickly become a burden (especially as a pool begins to grow very large). Run your Survivor football pool with us and see how easy it can be; and by that we mean automated for everyone including the Pool Admin/Commissioner too! \n\nHere are the rules for Survivor pools:\n - Each pool member chooses one team each week.\n - Picks are made \"straight up\", not using a point spread system.\n - If their pick is correct, they survive until the next week.\n - An incorrect pick eliminates the player from the pool for the remainder of the season.\n - The goal is to be the the last member standing at the end of the season. \n\nRunning your Survivor Pool has never been so easy:\n - No more collecting picks from your members. Members make their picks directly in the app real time.\n - No more error-ridden or illegible pick sheets.\n - No more tabulating strikes and who has been eliminated. Pool standings are automatically updated.\n - No more determining the game scores/outcomes, Winners and losers are automatically updated.\n - No more need to distribute standings. Members simply login to the site to see updates.\n\nNext, our Pick'em pool format is arguably our most traditional football pool. Even though this format is basic, it can still be very difficult for someone running the football pool to keep up with gathering the picks and calculating standings manually. That is where we come in.\n\nHow does our Pick'em Pool format work:\n - Each pool member picks winning games each week.\n - 'Monday Night Football' tiebreaker of total combined points.\n - For each correct pick during the regular season, members receive one point.\n - Standings are calculated for the week and for the season.\n\nWe remove the grunt work and mistakes from your Pick'em Pool:\n - Automated pick collections. You no longer have your members send you their picks. \n - Error-free pick sheet. We make it impossible for your members to make technical errors when submitting picks.\n- Automatic updating. Pool standings are automatically updated in real-time.\n- No more need to distribute standings. Members simply login to the app to see updates."

In contrast to other apps on the market, we have speciallized in creating a tournament generator that can handle low, high or uneven number of players.\n\nTHE SCORING SYSTEM\nBased on a predetermined number of points per game (e.g. 21 points) the team that takes the most number of points will be the winner of the match. This also means that being the winner or loser of the match is irrelevant. The reason for this is that each point counts in your individual results. As a player you should always aim to get as many points as possible, it will not be the same to win 20 to 1 than 11 to 10.\n\nHOW TO WIN IN AMERICANO\nTo become the winner of the Padel Americano you have to not only rely on your technical and tactical skills, but also a high level of adaption and coordination with your different teammates throughout the tournament.\n\n\nTerms of Use (EULA):\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

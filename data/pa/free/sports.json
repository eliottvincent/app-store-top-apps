In contrast to other apps on the market, we have speciallized in creating a tournament generator that can handle low, high or uneven number of players.\n\nTHE SCORING SYSTEM\nBased on a predetermined number of points per game (e.g. 21 points) the team that takes the most number of points will be the winner of the match. This also means that being the winner or loser of the match is irrelevant. The reason for this is that each point counts in your individual results. As a player you should always aim to get as many points as possible, it will not be the same to win 20 to 1 than 11 to 10.\n\nHOW TO WIN IN AMERICANO\nTo become the winner of the Padel Americano you have to not only rely on your technical and tactical skills, but also a high level of adaption and coordination with your different teammates throughout the tournament.\n\n\nTerms of Use (EULA):\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

There you can create posts, analyze videos, and give feedback in a secure, private channel dedicated solely to your athlete's improvement.\n\nCoaching a team or group of athletes? \"Groups\" are like Spaces, but designed with features that support a team environment. Within \"Groups\", create channels of common topics (e.g. \"Scheduling\", \"Game day Plans\", \"Team Goals\"), allowing your whole team to easily communicate and achieve their goals faster than ever.\n\nQuickly Post or Reply in a “Space” or “Group” with Videos, Images, Audio, Text, Spreadsheets, Documents, and more – all easily accessible, right when you need them.\n\nEasily reuse all past documents, videos, and photos with your personal Cloud Library. All paid plans include Cloud Storage.\n\n\nVIDEO AND IMAGE ANALYSIS FEATURES\n\nAccess the Video Analysis Tools directly in an athlete Space or Group.\n\nWhen creating a post, you can shoot a new video, re-use a video from your Personal CoachNow library, or upload one from your camera roll.\n\nAdd context to your feedback with built-in Voice Over. Add your voice to any video or photo to add more context to your training.

In contrast to other apps on the market, we have speciallized in creating a tournament generator that can handle low, high or uneven number of players.\n\nTHE SCORING SYSTEM\nBased on a predetermined number of points per game (e.g. 21 points) the team that takes the most number of points will be the winner of the match. This also means that being the winner or loser of the match is irrelevant. The reason for this is that each point counts in your individual results. As a player you should always aim to get as many points as possible, it will not be the same to win 20 to 1 than 11 to 10.\n\nHOW TO WIN IN AMERICANO\nTo become the winner of the Padel Americano you have to not only rely on your technical and tactical skills, but also a high level of adaption and coordination with your different teammates throughout the tournament.\n\n\nTerms of Use (EULA):\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

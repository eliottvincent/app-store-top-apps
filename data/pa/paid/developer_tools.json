With numerous custom records to get you started, you'll be writing to most NDEF-formatted NFC tags in no time. Don't have any NDEF-formatted tags? Format them in the Advanced section.\n\nTag-specific features are being added that allow you to edit a tag's memory directly, which opens the doors to all kinds of new features!\n\nTag not scanning? NDEF format new tags from the Advanced section to get them working right!\n\nAn NFC tag is written with a single \"Message\" which contains any number of \"Records.\" These records define text, links, and data to be stored on the tag. Most tags can be scanned by holding the top of your iPhone within a few centimeters. A chip is only limited only by its size. As long as the chip is NDEF-formatted (most are, and other formats will be supported in a later version) and it has enough space, the limits are endless!\n\nFeatures:\n- Read, write, duplicate, erase, and permanently lock NDEF-formatted tags\n- Monitor a tag's max capacity (usually somewhere between 256-1024 Bytes)\n- Read, write, and interact with links (https://, sms://, facetime://, mailto:, etc.)\n- Write a variety of pre-defined Social Media and website records\n- Read and write text records with multiple language localizations\n- Use Background Tag Reading to interact with NFC tags without an app. Write a link to a tag and then tap it to your phone. Voila! (Supported on iPhone XS and newer)\n- Review and rewrite previous messages from your History to another tag\n- Format factory-programmed tags as NDEF tags in-app (Supports most common tags such as Type 2 and Type 5 NFC tags)\n- Read and write directly to a tag's memory\n- Send custom commands directly to a tag\n- And of course, target your users better by using a tag's unique identifier\n\nExtras:\n- Dark Mode\n- Privacy: we collect nothing as you use the app.\n\nSupported Devices:\n- NFC scanning is available on iPhone 7 and newer. iPad and iPod Touch do not have the required hardware.\n- Background Tag Reading is available on iPhone XS and newer. iOS will present a notification for the first valid link stored on a tag.\n\nSupported Tags:\n- Any NDEF-formatted tags\n- MIFARE Ultralight\n- NTAG 213/215/216\n- NXP ICODE® Tags, ISO 15693 Tags, and Type 5 Tags\n\nFuture support for:\n- MIFARE DESFire\n\nLimitations:\n- MIFARE Classic tags are not currently supported by iOS\n\n\nFuture features:\n- Include a tag's ID and/or its read count in a record\n- Password-protect an NFC chip\n- Connect to a Bluetooth device\n\nFeel free to Tweet feature requests to me at @0xA1EC"

This interpreter is true to the original John McCarthy Lisp implementation with the fundamental 7 operators quote, atom, eq, car, cdr, cons, cond, along with lambda and label. My Lisp also contains core and mathematical operators borrowed from other Lisp dialects (Le Lisp, Lisp 1.5, MacLisp, Common Lisp and Scheme to name a few) to make it easy to learn, program, and most importantly, enjoy Lisp. It also features built-in functions for advanced mathematics, including complex numbers and numerical analysis (roots and zeros finder, integral approximation). The complete description of the fundamental, core, and built-in functions is available using a set of library functions completely written in My Lisp.\n\nMy Lisp offers an interpreter and an editor, all working on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and most importantly, without requiring any server connection, that is, the interpreter is executing locally on the iPhone, iPad or Mac My Lisp is installed on. \n\nLibrary and example files contain the source code of classical functions and problems solved by My Lisp and may be used as reference to learn Lisp and develop other programs. They include classical puzzles (hanoi and n-queens), basic mathematical functions (gcd, lcm, factorial, fibonacci, prime?), and the historical apply, mapcar and maplist functions. The Lambda Calculus example file contains various functions related to Lambda Calculus and Combinators, with alpha-conversion, beta-reduction, de Bruijn notations, etc. As a special note, the example file Symbolic Derivation contains a complete yet extensible symbolic derivation module allowing to compute the formal derivation of virtually any symbolic function expressed as a Lisp expression.\n\nA user manual and a reference manual are available from within the application but also on My Lisp web site (https://lisp.lsrodier.net) and in Apple Books. The complete source code of the library and example files is part of My Lisp. \n\nLast but not least, this overview couldn’t end without a sample definition of the notorious REPL function:\n\t(define (REPL eval_me) (REPL (println (eval (read)))))"

      "label": "This is the Legacy version of Blink Shell. Download the new free version Blink Shell instead from https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1594898306. \n\nCurrent users are grandfathered to keep receiving updates and new features. We are keeping this version alive to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nThanks for understanding.\n\n—\n\nWe had no choice. We had to build Blink or we were going to jump out the window in frustration over the tools we were using. We started by analyzing what the must-haves were and we ended up grounding Blink on these four concepts:\n\n• Fast rendering: dmesg in your Unix server should be instantaneous. We can't wait even a second to render. We didn't need to reinvent the wheel to make this happen. We simply used Chromium's HTerm to ensure that rendering is perfect and fast, even with those special, tricky encodings.\n• Always on: Mosh transcends SSH's variability. Mosh overcomes the unstable and intermittent connectivity that we all associate with mobile connections. You can check your Safari without fear of having to restart the SSH connection. You can flawlessly jump from home, to the train, and then the office thanks to Mosh. Blink is rock-solid connected all the way. Mosh is readily available and can be easily installed on your server. Go to https://mosh.mit.edu.\n• Best Keyboard Support: Blink embraces Bluetooth-coupled keyboards with gusto. Some like Caps as Esc on Vim, others Caps as Ctrl on Emacs. Blink champions them all. During your always-on sessions, you're in your zone.\n• Custom Fonts and Themes: We know how important it is to have your terminal, your way. That's why we include a selection of fonts and themes, including Powerline variants. And if that isn't enough, you can create and add your own.\n\nBut, Blink is much more. Please read on.\n\n• You should command your terminal, not navigate it. Blink will jump you right into a friendly shell and it'll be clear to you how to roll.\n• The interface is straightforward. We dumped all menus and went full screen for your terminal. Use swipe to move between your open connections, slide down to close them, and even pinch to zoom!\n• Configure your Blink connections by adding your own Hosts and PKI keys. Synchronise with iCloud. Everything will look familiar and you get to work, fast!\n- We've incorporated SplitView and multiple windows, for those necessary Google searches and chats with coworkers.\n\nBlink is open source software. Participate in our community, and don’t forget to leave us your feedback and your feature(s) requests. Enjoy!\n\nhttp://blink.sh\nhttp://twitter.com/blinkshell\nhttp://GitHub.com/blinksh"

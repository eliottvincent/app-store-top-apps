By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

      "label": "Solunar Table for the Best Hunting and Fishing Times. \nIf you like bird watching, hunting, or fishing, have this app handy and it will provide you with the location-specific information that make your next trip a success!\n\nThe solunar (lunar) period is the time of day when wildlife such as fish and game are most active. Determining the solunar period is therefore useful for activities such as birdwatching, fishing or hunting. There are two major and two minor solunar periods each day. The time at which each solunar occurs varies depending on the date and on your geographical location.\n\nThe app helps you to determine the solunar period and expected animal activity index (where 6-point is when animals are most active).

También es recomendable para aquellos que quieran comenzar a patinar, a enseñar o para padres que quieran conocer más del deporte que practica su hijo y que no cuentan con la información suficiente. \nEsta primera aplicación comienza con los primeros pasos hasta llegar al axel, dividido en etapas de aprendizajes. Las bases que aquí se describen conjuntamente con la correlatividad que se propone apuntan a formar patinadores que lleguen al axel (salto de una vuelta y media) en perfectas condiciones técnicas y puedan seguir aprendiendo con una base sólida, que en el futuro les permitirá llegar a saltos de más rotaciones. \nEs decir que desde el primer día sobre los patines, se enseñan todos aquellos pasos que son fundamentales para el dominio del equilibrio para girar, dominar los filos, deslizar, logrando un aprendizaje progresivo hasta llegar al objetivo. \nPor primera vez llega esta publicación dedicada al patinaje libre, dividido en etapas de aprendizaje. De esta manera se profundiza en las explicaciones y en indicaciones prácticas en ilustraciones detalladas, que hacen accesible la compresión. \nSi amás el patinaje artístico sobre ruedas, aquí tendrás la oportunidad de conocer más sobre este maravilloso deporte."

      "label": "Listen to your racquet and perfect your game!\n\nRacquetTune ensures that your racquet is ideally suited to your style of play. Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

Those predictions and data are designed and prepared by European Sports Analyzers and Computer Engineers.\n* In our applications, you can find the whole leagues’ matches and league table in the same screen and you can easily compare them. \n\n What is the biggest advantages of our application?\n* All data is ready and in one sheet; easy to compare everything. \n* You can compare league by league.\n* You can compare match by match.\n* You can compare according to total match statistics.\n* You can compare according to home/away statistics.\n \n What is our aim?\n* Our aim is not to bilk you by showing you incorrect data.\n* Our aim is not to serve expansive predictions.\n* Our aim is to serve you useful data and the choice up to you. We are leaving the choice to you.\n* Of course, in the future there will be some other fake applications, but do not forget us, we are the first to do this and we will always be best for you.\n \n What is the reason to choose us for you?\n* We are cheaper than others. If you look or search in the internet, you will see that other applications are much more expensive than us.\n* Others show only the matches which they liked. But we are giving all matches to you.\n* Others show only some statistics but we show all statistics to you.\n* Others sends the predictions by email 12-24 hours ago, but you can see all predictions online in our applications.\n\n Which data you will see in our application?\n* League Name\n* Home Team\n* Away Team\n* Home Team Score\n* Away Team Score\n* Home Team Odd\n* Away Team Odd\n* Home Team – Total Matches\n* Away Team – Total Matches\n* Home Team – Home Matches\n* Away Team – Away Matches\n* Total Goal Average, for Over/Under prediction.\n* Prediction for result and percentage of prediction.\n\n If you have any idea, question or need, please feel free to contact with us by using this email address : info@north-software.com \n \n Some additional descriptions:\n\n Some people prefer to bet on some leagues and some others prefer to bet on different leagues. For this reason, even if it reduce our success percentage, we wanted to serve you almost every league. You will decide which league or which team you want to bet on.\n\n For “1” and “2” predictions, we suggest you to use only first leagues. For second and third leagues, it is more common to see that strong teams loose the match or the match ends in draw. We do not restrict those kind of situations in our application because we want to serve you every single match.\n\n For “Over” and “Under” predictions, we suggest you to prepare one table to determine which league is suitable for “Over” or “Under” betting. For example: Greece first league, Greece second league, Portugal second league, Spain second league are not suitable for “Over” predictions. Do not bet on.\n\n We tried to explain how you are going to use this application, we hope that we succeeded. If you are good at logic and mathematics, than you will use this application more effective and successful. You will use this application more effective day by day. You will even create black list for teams and leagues by time pasing.\n\n Good luck !"

It doesn’t require any connection to your car. Results are provided as detailed reports featuring interactive charts.\n\nHow does PerfExpert dyno works ? It's simple :\n1. Create your car profile => Describe your car to PerfExpert by providing information such as curb weight, tire sizes or engine displacement. If you don't know how to find your car's specifications, we help you to do so.\n2. Mount your phone in your car => No need to connect your phone to your car. With your phone firmly mounted inside your car, PerfExpert can rely on its internal sensors to measure the real acceleration of your car.\n3. Accelerate through the entire engine rev range => On a flat, straight and horizontal road, perform an acceleration from low rev to the maximum rev, keeping the same gear : that's it!\n\nIMPORTANT : dyno test is not compatible with automatic gearboxes that doesn't have a manual mode.\n\nWith such a tool, you can check the efficiency of your various tunings, ECU mapping, chiptuning, and even your chassis settings.\n\nUsing the specification of the tested car and your device’s accelerometer, the application runs our algorithms and dynamic power loss calculations to provide the performances of your car with high accuracy.\n\nSkeptical? Here is a selection of comparison tests between “PerfExpert - Car Onboard Dyno” and real chassis dynos, performed by some of our users : http://bit.ly/perfexpert_vs_chassis_dyno\n\nFor further information, you can find our FAQ at https://www.perfexpert-app.com/faq\n\nHere are sample dyno and timed run reports created using the application :\nhttps://network.perfexpert-app.com/results/featured\n\nJoin now the growing PerfExpert community:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PerfExpert\n- Support : https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfexpert/\n\nFeatures:\n- Dyno test : measure the power and torque of your engine with advanced loss calculation model. Detection of the engine rev limiter. Detailed reports featuring interactive charts of wheel and engine horsepower and torque / engine speed, just like a regular chassis dynamometer.\n\n- Compute corrected power and torque using the correction norm of your choice (atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature and air humidity are taken into account). Available standards: DIN (Europe), SAE (America), JIS (Japan), CEE (Europe) and ISO (International).\n\n- Timed Run test to measure your 0-60mph, 0-60ft, 0-1/8mi, 0-1/4mi, 0-100km/h, 0-20m, 0-200m, 0-400m,  and much more.\n\n- Use of your phone accelerometer at its maximum frequency and advanced signal processing for smoothed curves.\n\n- Custom choice of units from a large choice: Hp, Ch, Cv, Kw, Nm, Ft.Lb, mKg, Mph, Km/h, m, ft, G, m/s², psi, inHg, mBar, °C, °F\n\n- Export reports in Tab Separated Value format and PNG"

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next.\n\n- Results: In this tab, a recommended jetting and exhaust length setup are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine and track configuration given in the following tabs. The following values are given: high needle, low needle, pop-off pressure and exhaust length. Besides this information, the air density and density altitude are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tunning adjustment for the high and low needles to adapt to the concrete engine. \n\n- Weather: In the second tab, called Weather, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: You must set in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the engine type (Leopard, X30 Senior, X30 Junior X30 Super), carburetor, exhaust restrictions (for Junior engines), the oil mix ratio and the type of the circuit (short or long tracks). Depending of the track type, the jetting setups will be adapted.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity). \n\nThe application works with different measure units: inHg, mb, mmHg, hPa, atm for pressure, ºC and ºF for temperature."

Using all the data the application will give you some recommendations about how to adjust your chassis in order to resolve any set up problem that you're suffering. For each advice, you'll find an explanation about the adjustment. The explanation usually contains pictures to be more understandable.\n\nThe application is valid for sprint (road) karts and for all classes (adult or senior, cadet, junior). It's usefull for both experienced or novice drivers. For the former, it'll be a second opinion about what's wrong with the chassis setup, and for novices it will teach them the secrets of the chassis adjustments and chassis setup.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Driving: in this tab you'll have to inform about how the driver feels the behaviour of the kart in corners. In the first fields, \"Behaviour in corners\" you'll have to enter the information about what the driver is feeling and in which grade, that is, if it's very noticeable or not. These are the most important information used by the application to calculate the advices. You can enter, in this tab, if the track is clockwise or anti-clockwise, and the current temperature. Both elements are taking into consideration for calculations.\nBesides, you can indicate some information about the driver in order to adjust the calculations for his weight and chassis special features. \n\n- Pressure: in this tab you can inform about the hot and cold pressures of each tyre. \n\n- Temperature: you can set in this screen the information about hot tyre temperatures in the inside, middle and outside of the patch.\n\n- Results: this tab will show you some recommendations related on which adjustments you can do to solve any problem in the chassis setup that you can be suffering. A screen with detailed information about the adjustment will be shown. This explanation is very important in the \"Modify pressures\" advice, because it will show how much you should adjust your pressures.\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, PSI and BAR for pressures, lb and kg for weights."

      "label": "CrewNerd turns your cell phone into an on-the-water training tool in any rowing shell, canoe, kayak or dragon boat - with no wiring! With a waterproof case, you can get real-time data during your workout and even relay it to your coach.\n\nUsing the accelerometer in your device, CrewNerd is able to accurately calculate your stroke rate as well as how much bounce (vertical movement) and stern check you are producing.  Speed, pace and distance are calculated via GPS.\n\n• Configurable display\n\nIn landscape mode there are up to six configurable data fields, and in portrait mode there are up to ten. Choose from the following:\n  • Stroke rate\n  • Elapsed time\n  • Distance\n  • Speed or pace\n  • Average speed or pace\n  • Heart rate\n  • Stroke count\n  • Interval count\n  • Meters per stroke\n  • Total distance\n  • Projected time and distance\n  • Check\n  • Bounce\n  • Course (direction)\n  • Time of day\n\nSet the top line to be double-height to make the most important data stand out. In portrait mode, the top two lines can both be made double-height.\n\n• Custom workouts\n\nSelect from one of the provided workouts, or create your own based on distance, time or strokes.  An auto-start feature starts the timer when the first stroke is taken, or you can set a “countdown” of 15 or 30 seconds before the timer starts to allow you to build up speed before starting a piece.\n\n• Custom courses\n\nCreate custom by plotting your start and finish lines on a map. The application will start the timer automatically when you cross the start line and stop when you reach the finish. This is great for hands free operation in long distance races or for set routes you routinely use.\n\n• Review your data\n\nAll workout data is recorded and can be reviewed on the device or uploaded directly to Strava, Concept2, TrainingPeaks, Sportlyzer, or the Apple Health app. On the history page for your practice, press \"Select export type\" to choose one of these options.\n\nYou can also export data as GPX, KML, TCX, or CSV. You can view a map of your workout or view an interval data chart with configurable distance markers showing split times on your phone.\n\n• Heart rate\n\nCrewNerd supports all Bluetooth Smart heart rate monitors.\n\n• Live position tracking\n\nStream your workout data as it happens to any web browser via CrewNerd.com.\n\n• VoiceOver support\n\nFor blind and vision-impaired athletes, CrewNerd provides audible feedback during your workouts. Configure the content and timing of the announcements to meet your needs.\n\n• For coaches\n\nUse custom workouts to keep your practices on target. In coach mode, you can tap anywhere on the screen to check stroke rate. CrewNerd can also be used on the iPad for a larger display.\n\nWaterproof cases are available to protect your iPhone on the water. See our web site for more information."

      "label": "****Designed by sport scientists, trusted by elite athletes****\n****Validated in the prestigious Journal of Sports Sciences****\n\nWhat is your maximal strength? Which weight should you use in your next training session to optimize results? My Lift is the first scientifically designed app to measure your 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM) in the most accurate way possible. \n\nKnowing your 1-RM in every single training session is essential to adjust your training intensity and get the best adaptations. However, performing an actual 1-RM test could be dangerous and fatiguing and, if performed every day, it will most likely lead to overtraining or injuries. \n\nTo solve this problem, My Lift uses scientifically validated algorithms that can estimate your 1-RM with high precision by simply recording your exercise. To do this, My Lift uses the high-speed video recording available on most iPhone and iPad devices to measure the velocity at which you are performing the exercise, which is highly correlated with your maximal strength capabilities. This novel approach is used by sport scientists and top-level coaches thanks to advanced instrumental like linear transducers or force platforms, but now you can measure your 1-RM like a pro just with your iPhone or iPad!\n\nMy Lift is very intuitive and easy to use: you just need to record one repetition of the desired exercise with 1 to 4 different submaximal loads and select its start and beginning in the app with its accurate frame-by-frame navigation. After that, My Lift will show you your 1-RM! \n\nLet's say you got a workout which includes 4x5 repetitions at your 80%1-RM. Well, you just need to pick a load and record one repetition with My Lift. It will tell if that load really corresponds to your 80% or not, so you can increase or decrease the weight to train in the right zone!\n\nMy Lift has a lot of great features that will help you measure your 1-RM in a very simple, yet powerful way:\n\n-Estimates your 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM) in a very simple way by measuring your movement velocity, a novel approach used by top sport scientists and elite coaches\n-Measures what %1-RM corresponds to a specific load so you can adjust your training and get the best results\n-Calculate your movement velocity to monitor your performance!\n-Analysis of velocity loss to monitor fatigue.\n-Track the trajectory of your lift and measure instantaneous position and velocity\n-Works with some of the most widely-used upper and lower body exercises by default: bench-press, deadlift, pull-up, military press, back squat & hip thrust. You can even create your own exercises!\n-Multi-team and multi-user: create as many teams and users as you want\n-Progress analysis: save as many tests as you want and see your progress through time to check if you have improved or worsened your performance. You can even see the percent of change from one test to another!\n-Data export: export your whole database to a csv file and play with your data in Excel!\n-iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n-Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n\nMy Lift, train smarter and get the best results!"

Using scientifically validation equations, Runmatic calculates the contact-flight times, force, efficiency, frequency and even the asymmetry of your legs in a simple, accurate way. Runmatic can also analyze your stride informing about relevant variables such as pronation, pelvic drop or strike pattern, which could help you prevent injuries. \n\nRunmatic is an extraordinary tool for sprint analysis as well. It can measure total time, splits and contact/flight times with a precision comparable to professional timing gates. Moreover, it can create Kinograms (following the methodology by ALTIS) to analyze the quality of motion of each phase of the sprint. You can even calculate the most relevant angles of your body!\n\n\n****Pr. Jean-Benoit Morin, PhD, Expert in running biomechanics: \"This is a very useful app to evaluate and monitor the mechanics of the runners' strides. It's accurate, it's scientifically validated and it uses equations derived from our research (Morin et al., 2005). The tools often used to perform this kind of analyses are much more expensive and generally less practical for the general population. Runmatic solves this problem and allows runners to analyze and monitor their running mechanics in an easy way\"\n\n****Arturo Casado, Olympic runner, 2010 European 1500m Champion: \"Runmatic is very helpful for my training. It let me better understand how do I run, which is critical to improve my running economy and, therefore, my performance. Is like a lab in my pocket!\"\n\nRunmatic has a lot of great features that will help you monitor your running and sprinting performance in a very simple, yet powerful way:\n\n-Calculate contact time, flight time, frequency, max force, displacement of the center of mass and leg stiffness with scientific accuracy\n-Analyze your stride to calculate your pelvic drop, pronation and strike patter, which could help you prevent injuries.\n-Measure total time, splits and contact and flight times of your sprints.\n-Analyze the quality of the sprint by creating Kinograms (ALTIS methodology).\n-Multi-user: create as many users as you want\n-iCloud sync (iOS13 only)\n-Progress analysis: save as many runs as you want and see your progress through time to check if you have improved or worsened your performance.

      "label": "A tool designed for youth baseball coaches, to save you tons of time and keep you organized and informed. Also works great for softball, kickball, etc. or just tracking your personal stats. Syncs with iCloud to all your devices, and you can share with others, too.\n\nI've been coaching little league baseball for over 6 years. I've tried paper scorebooks, spreadsheets, and  smartphone apps but nothing worked quite the way I wanted. I created something that will save you HOURS of time, year after year - isn't that worth a few dollars to you?\n\nThe season starts with practices. Pocket Coach provides an attendance keeper for practices. I don't know about you, but I reward players who show up for practices. Simply check off who is present, and now you have that information for later when you are planning your lineup.\n\nIn baseball, rain happens. You probably need to send out a quick notice to parents and players when an event gets canceled or delayed, when you're at the field away from your computer. You can store 2 emails and 2 mobile phone numbers for each player, and in seconds blast out a team email or text message. Parents appreciate that!\n\nPlanning the lineup for games is what I used to spend alot of time on. In little league, players will often play different positions throughout a game. A good coach will think this through carefully ahead of time, and lay out each position for each inning, including bench time. (Of course, changes may occur based on game situations, and being able to quickly change this on the fly is a great feature of this app.) How often did your lineup accidentally include two left fielders and no center fielder? Doh! Pocket Coach will clearly highlight positions in red when you mess up.\n\nI also like to consider how often each player has played in the infield, in the outfield, sat on the bench, etc. when planning the lineup. You have all of this information at your fingertips now! When you're done, you can print a lineup sheet directly from your phone or email it to another coach.\n\nFor younger leagues, you may just want to randomize the fielding positions, and you can do that too.\n\nI've long ago given up trying to decypher scorebooks when tracking batting averages etc., so I would always write my own notes on an index card, and plug that into a spreadsheet later. As a coach, you care about batting RESULTS. With a couple screen taps, you can quickly and easily record a batting result: single, strikeout, fielders choice, whatever. Very simple, anyone can do it with no training. Later, you can pull up all the important batting statistics.\n\nIt's very important to keep track of how many pitches each pitcher has thrown, and there is a pitch counter built in. It also tracks balls and strikes, walks and strikeouts, hits and outs, and runs. \n\nOf course, a baseball coach usually coaches multiple teams over the years, and Baseball Pocket Coach supports as many teams as you want. You might play softball yourself and want to track your own batting stats but not the entire team, you can do that! Some parents might want to use Pocket Baseball Coach to track their own child's stats, and use the group email and texting features. Trust me, it's way easier to use than the \"free\" apps out there! (Nothing is free if it gives you a headache to try to use it : )\n\nWith Pocket Coach you can print or email a ton of reports directly from your iPhone, iPad, or M1 Mac. Geek out all the way and use an iPad in the dugout for your players to see, while you make changes on your iPhone.\n\nRuns great on a Mac with Apple Silicon."

      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

You can time relay teams with a single button, recording individual splits along with total individual and teams times.\n\nIt includes support for 3 type of courses: SCY (25y), SCM (25m) y LCM (50m). Also it has 26 predefined events (21 individual and 5 relays). \n\nThe application can be used to time one or multiple swimmers in the same race. Also it includes a module which allows you to time relay events. \n\nKeeps all your events history for later review and analysis. Each performance can be shared by email. \n\nIt allows you to Import/Export swimmers. This is useful when you have a big roaster and needs to be imported to the app. Also if you have the app installed in different devices (iPad and iPhone), it facilitates the process of keeping on sync the roaster. \n\nIt allows to predefine Teams of swimmers (before the meet). These teams, along with individual swimmers, are available to pick from when using the app during meets; these expedite you the process of timing events during the meet. \n\nSmart Stop feature: because this app has preloaded the events, it knows exactly when the final lap is, so it will stop the stopwatch at the end of the final lap, regardless of the button you use (lap or stop). \n\nLaps can be set at one length of the course or two lengths of the course based on your preferences.\n\nBecause StopWatch for Track and Field knows the event characteristics, you can record: \n\n-The distance for each lap \n-The swimmer estimated time during each lap\n-The estimated time of your relay team\n-The individual lap times and total time per leg in relay events \n\nIf you have questions, suggestions, issues, before writing it in a review, first don't hesitate to contact us to stopwatchsm@gmail.com"

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle type and clip position, pilot jet and air screw position are shown (screw position is expressed in turns from fully tightened). These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration introduced in the next tabs. Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. The air density and density altitude are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine (you know that each engine has its own personality). \n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the model year, model and carburetor, and the oil mix ratio that you\\'re using.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures.\n\nValid for the following models from 2005 to 2021:\n- 50 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 50 SX Factory Edition: 2021.\n- 50 SX Mini: 2017-2021.\n- 65 SX: 2017-2021.\n- 85 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 105 SX: 2006-2012.\n- 125 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 125 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 125 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 125 XC: 2017-2018.\n- 144 SX: 2007-2008.\n- 150 SX: 2009-2021.\n- 150 XC: 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019.\n- 200 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 200 XC: 2005-2012.\n- 250 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 250 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 250 XC: 2007-2019.\n- 250 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 XC: 2009-2018.\n- 300 MXC: 2005.\n* Please note that the application is valid only for engines that use carburetor.

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, four different jetting setups are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine and track configuration given in the next tabs. For each jetting setup, the following values are given: main jet, emulsion tube, needle type and clip position, inner pilot jet (iddle diffuser) and outer pilot jet (iddle jet). Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude and relative horsepower are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tunning adjustment for the main (high), needle (mid) and pilot (low) circuits for each jetting setup to adapt to the concrete engine. \n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the engine model (K9, K9B, K9C, KZ10, KZ10B, KZ10C, KZ-R1), the float type and height, the oil mix ratio and the type of the circuit (spring or road racing, short or long). Depending of the track type, the jetting setups will be adapted.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures."

If you search in the internet, you will see that other applications are more expensive than us.\n* We are showing all matches. Others show only some matches.\n* Others are sending the predictions 12-24 hours before the current day, only by email, but we are providing all predictions online in our application.\n\nIf you have any idea or question, please feel free to contact with us.\ninfo@north-software.com\n\nSome additional descriptions:\n\nSome people prefer to bet on some specific leagues but some other people prefer to bet on different leagues. For this reason, even if it is reducing our success percentage, we wanted to show you almost every league. You can decide which league or which team that you want to bet on.\n\nFor “1” and “2” predictions, we suggest you to use only first leagues. For second and third leagues, it is more common to see that strong teams loose the match or the match ends in draw. We do not want to hide some matches in our application because we want to show you every single match.\n\nWe hope you will like this application.\n\nGood luck!"

Star your favorite players. Find out when the players you want are getting drafted. Tap Refresh for up-to-date players and rankings.\n\n- Keep Up With Picks\nSelect a player and tap the Draft button. Choose if the player is going to be on Your Team or Other Team. Finally, a fantasy draft app designed for ease of use! \n\n- Need for Speed\nDrafts move quickly, so you need an app that can keep up. You don’t have time to flip through pages, point and click around the Internet, or stare at a “Loading” message as the clock winds down when it’s your turn to pick. \n\n- Ranking Players\nDraft Champ provides average draft position (ADP) player rankings for hundreds of players. No more printing cheat sheets. \n\n- Average Round\nFind out when a player usually gets drafted using your custom League Size setting and a player's average draft position ranking. \n\n- Player Status\nEasily see which players are injured, suspended, or rookies.\n * O = out for the season\n * I = sidelined due to injury\n * S = suspended\n * R = rookie\n\n- Results View\nKeep track of the draft picks and your players by tapping the Results button. Use context menus to make changes to picks.\n\n- Simple and Elegant\nDesigned by a fantasy football player who understands the importance of Draft day. Spend the small price now to dominate your opponents from September to January. While they’re fumbling around with a laptop, you’re staying one step ahead with a few taps of the finger.\n\n- Finding Players\nQuickly and easily view all players, sort by position, or search by name. No more skimming over printed draft sheets trying to find a player, pick after pick. Never heard of the guy? No clue what position he plays? Then just tap All and then Search by the first few letters of his name.\n\n- Go Green\nDon’t print up sheets of paper and waste expensive ink when you can complete your entire draft anytime, anywhere, with the tap of a finger.\n\n- View Players\nThe Settings allow you to view All Players, Only Available Players (my favorite), and Only Drafted Players. \n\n- Search\nCan’t find a player? Don’t like scrolling? Just tap the Search bar and enter the first 1 or two letters of the players name and you’ll find them no problem. If you have trouble finding a player, select All positions and make sure you are not filtering by position.\n\n- Whoops!\nDid you mark the wrong guy as Drafted? Then just tap the Undraft button and keep going.\n\n- Reset\nDo you have multiple drafts? You can use Draft Champ over and over again by tapping the Reset button. Reset everything to defaults or just your draft picks, keeping the favorites for next time. \n\n- Refresh\nGet the latest player rankings by tapping the Refresh button. Did you print up your draft sheets last week? They’re out of date already.\n\nBuy the app for a small price and increase your chances of becoming your Fantasy Football League Champ!"

The list with the kata forms is build as a to-do-list. Depending on your progress, you can hook a kata off to change its order for a better overview.\n•The portrait mode allows you to recognize and study important details, since illustrations are bigger.\n• Illustrations can be zoomed in.\n• Two final techniques are always bound with three movements inbetween. Thus you can exactly follow how to get from one technique to another.\n• 3 different animation speeds and free scrolling allow you to adjust the app to the individual learning progress.\n• Landscape mode offers you a view of multiple graphics at one time to be able to better follow the sequences.\n• Six freely eligible backgrounds put you in the right training mood.\n• Always available legend allows you to look up the symbols really fast.\n\nThis App contains all 27 Shôtôkan-Kata:\n\nTaikyoku shodan\nHeian shodan\nHeian nidan\nHeian sandan\nHeian yondan\nHeian godan\nTekki shodan\nTekki nidan\nTekki sandan\nBassai dai\nBassai shô\nKankû dai\nKankû shô\nEmpi\nHangetsu\nJion\nJitte\nJi’in\nChinte\nGankaku\nNijû shi ho\nSôchin\nWankan\nMeikyô\nGojû shi ho dai\nGojû shi ho shô\nUnsu\n\nWe wish you a lot of fun at practicing and hope that we could support you a little bit !"

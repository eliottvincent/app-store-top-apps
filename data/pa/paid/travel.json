The customization is amazing.\"\n\nHere's a brief overview of special aspects of News Clocks you won't find elsewhere:\n\nAdd, delete, and rearrange your clocks with ease. No internet connection is required to search for cities. Use the built-in help feature to learn more. \n\nAnalog clock styles include modern, gold luxury, aviation, simple, and Chinese numerals. Digital style also included.\n\nWith Nightstand Mode, let the app run while you sleep. Enjoy four brightness settings and an integrated alarm. The auto lock feature keeps the screen turned on if your device is plugged in to power.\n\nNew, customizable double line labels now show even more city information! Show the time, date, 24 hour (\"military\") time, day of week, or even relative dates like \"Today\" and \"Tomorrow\".\n\nThe date calculator computes zone changes, date addition and subtraction, can plan and project meeting times for locations around the world, and even distances between cities.\n\nLunar phase (on the polar mapped globe view) is shown in real time."

It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button. You can swipe through all your favorites on the main calculation interface just as you swipe the pages on the iPhone’s home screen.\n\n== Charts and Historic Rates==\neCurrency provides detailed historical charts for all exchange rates.

The application obtains its exchange rates from our self-developed Currency-Provider-engine that aggregates rates data from multiple sources to secure the reliability of exchange rate updates.\n\n== Tutorial & Support==\nOn the first startup a short self-running demo is displayed to introduce you to the app. We appreciate any reviews or comments you may have on eCurrency in iTunes. If you have any questions please contact us directly, as we are unable to respond to your enquiries via iTunes."

Experience complete freedom and get value for your money! Use Cuba-Junky’s Casa Particular Directory app as your simple and user friendly ‘Yellow Pages’ while planning, traveling and exploring!\n\nWhy you need this app when you plan to visit Cuba \n- Cuba friendly and explorer friendly (simple, practical and cheap!)\n- Several updates a week with new casas and features \n- Even more casas in the app than on our website\n - Direct contact with the casa through the app\n - Save yourself  $5 per night by using the app to contact the owners directly  \n\nWhat are casas particulares? \nCuba’s version of B&Bs offer the island’s best lodging values for anyone who likes doing things authentically, or in this case: the Cuban way. You can find hundreds of casas in this app. They are rooms, suites, or sometimes entire apartments. The Cuba-Junky casa directory app is current, convenient, and easy to use. It provides casa photos, phone numbers, email addresses, Facebook and website links—all for about US $5!  \n\nOnline, offline and more \nBut there is more. The casa particular directory app is very frequently updated at no extra charge. And you can access other types of info through the app, such as the weather forecast, or use it to contact your casa.\n\n  No commission: save $5 per night! \nBy using this app and contacting a casa directly, you often save the $5 per night commission that the owner normally charges for bookings made through a third party. Casa owners pay no commission or other costs to Cuba Junky. Say this to the casa owner and get that discount!\n\n  Some free Cuba advice?\n Cuba-Junky’s advice is: make a reservation for your first night in Cuba and after that just “go with the flow.” Using your Cuba-Junky casa particular app, it will be easy to find casas while in Cuba, or to call ahead to a casa in the next town you plan to visit. You can talk to the owner directly, find out what’s available, and at what price.   \n\nWhy does this app cost about $5?  \nJust because Cuba Junky have to keep it running. We charge no hidden $5 per night commission. We just love Cuba. If you do too, go and enjoy it, and while you’ re at it, help us keep Cuban locals in the lead! ¡Gracias amigos!"

If you ever wonder where you are, your altitude, ground speed, direct distance to your destination in Miles, Nautical Miles and Kilometers, and how many hours you still have to get there, this app will help you!  \n\n Flight Nav uses GPS signals while in Airplane Mode to display your position, estimated distance, and time to your destination.\n\nYou can record your flight and later share it as a GPX file. This option will consume more battery as it will operate even while you are not using your device.\n\nOther features include a \"Don't sleep\" feature to keep the screen on.\n\n  GPS reception from within an aircraft can sometimes be poor. Best results are with window seats, or close to them, and you might have to wait longer to get results than you would while on the ground. What this means is that you might not get any signal at all, and the app might not work as expected every time, especially if you're sitting in the middle seats of a wide body airplane.\n\nMap detail will not be available at every zoom level - since you will be running offline - and you should use the app before flying, while still connected, in order to cache map information.\n\n  You should only use your device when allowed by the cabin crew - Please, pay attention to the specific instructions regarding mobile devices. If you have doubts about using your device, even with Airplane Mode enabled, please consult the cabin crew.  \n\nYou can add your own destinations by long pressing the map on the location you want.\n\nContinued use of GPS can dramatically decrease battery life."

This is a lot of fun and would be virtually impossible during a real roller coaster ride.\nAnd it is totally cool that you can take the ride as often as you want to - again and again! No additional costs \n\nOther than the Olympia roller coaster there are more rides included!: The Wilde Maus (Wild Mouse), that is famous for its sudden changes of direction and the Alpina roller coaster, another fast ride in virtual reality.\n\nStart the app and slip your iPhone into one of the many available Goggle VR glasses. With the help of the split screen each eye is assigned its own view.  The gyro-sensor in the iPhone, and that is special, moves the picture in front of your eyes according to how you move an bow your head. \nThis gives the impression of having a look around in a real room or environment. \n\nMany VR goggles you can use, for example ($2-$200),\n\n- Google Cardboard\n- ZEISS VR ONE\n- Homido\n- Durovis Dive\n- DODOcase\n- Andoer\n- Stooksy\n- VRB60.3D\n- Archos\n- visusVR\n- Refugio 3D\n- ColorCross VR\n- VIGICA Virtual Reality Headset\n- SUNNYPEAK®\n- SimpleVR®\n- A24 Colorcross\n- JoyGeek Google Cardboard\n- TechIntheBox ColorCross\n- EightOnes VR Kit\n- AGPtek®\n- Soyan 2015\n- NewSilkRoad Google Cardboard\n- KKmoon CST-01\n- Konsait Google Cardboard\n- FIVESUNG®\n- DESTEK®\n- Ematic EVR410\n- JoyGeek Google Cardboard\n- Neomark®\n- AFUNTA Universal VR\n- RiTech Virtual Reality\n- Yosoo®\n- ZwTech Google Cardboard\n- Google Cardboard Valencia\n- Virtual Reality VR TRID Screen Headset D601\n- Angelia DIY Google Cardboard\n- HLPB Google Cardboard\n- EUG Google Cardboard\n- KKmoon New Arrival DIY\n- FAVOLCANO®\n- Mi3D Virtual Reality\n- VR Envy Velocity\n- Kollea Version Google 3D\n- Valuetom®\n\n... and so much more.\n\n\nVR setup: With VR cardboard scan you can scan the QR code for your vr headset for right settings.\n\n\niPhone 4s, 5C, 5, 5S, 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, iPod touch\n\nSystem requirements:  iOS 8.1, iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.\nImportant: Please make sure that you have a VR glass for iPhone and/or iPad in order to see the app in VR View."

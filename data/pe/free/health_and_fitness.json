      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier.

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

You might feel anxious, constantly irritated, or even depressed. There is no shame in getting help while you get back on your feet. \n\nSensa is here to guide you through the entire journey to self-care, unlocking scientifically backed information to help you understand yourself better on your own terms.\n\nJust in 1–3 months, you will start your day with a new outlook on life.\n\nMeet your calm mind assistant:\n\n\nSelf-paced lessons\n\nHeal at your own pace and learn all about calming your mind with daily lessons about mental health. Understand how your thoughts, emotions, and behaviour are tightly interconnected, and start to untangle negative patterns using proven techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) experts.\n\n\nEasy daily tasks\n\nTry out quick yet effective 10–30-minute activities that help you create healthy lifelong habits. Find out which new habits are perfect for you and create a daily routine that puts you at ease. Build up your resilience to stress as you set up your morning, evening, and wind-down routines that bring peace to your day.\n\n\nMood journal\n\nDeep dive into your subconsciousness as you explore how you tend to react to challenges and victories. Track your mood in a mood journal, analyse the patterns that emerge, identify emotional triggers, and understand yourself better with every passing day. To feel better, you might need to eliminate certain stressors – but first, you must learn to identify them.\n\n\nHabit-building tips and strategies\n\nSmall changes repeated daily are more effective than massive changes repeated once. Implement new habits with surgical precision , and find out the easiest way to get better for years to come. Understand and manage your anxiety triggers at your own pace to always feel in control with tips and strategies that have helped thousands before you.\n\n\nWeekly assessments\n\nComplete the DASS-21 depression, anxiety, and stress self-evaluation surveys to track how your outlook changes over time.

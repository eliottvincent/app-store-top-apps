      "label": "iCurrencyPad is not just a simple and elegant currency convertor and calculator. \n\niCurrencyPad also offers an up-to-the-minute exchange rates \"electronic board\", detailed charts of historical price trends, and more:\n\n √  a polished, easy-to-use interface \n √  160+ currencies from around the world \n √  favorite currencies to reduce clutter \n √  charts for all exchange rates \n √  multiple data sources\n \n √   iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch resolutions\n √  HD Retina graphics optimized for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Excellent! Professional! Highly Recommended... finally the currency application I have been waiting for so long...\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"...I tried all other similar apps, and I am proud to announce that this app is simply the best of them all..\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Smart, intuitive and flexible!... slick interface with great functionality which further impresses with its great selection of currencies and immediate updates. Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "Account Book is an app which helps you to control your finances. Who doesn't know that feeling of having less and less money in your account at the end of the month eventhough you haven't bought anything special? This is where keeping a household account book comes in handy. But how many actually do this? Sitting down every day and detailing your exact spending only to find that at the end of the month your bank account still shows the same deficit as before. \n\nThis app will help you to order your finances in an easy way. Due to the clear and simple layout, you can enter your daily expenses and incomes in only a few seconds. \n\nInitially, it is advisable to enter your monthly fixed costs (e.g. rent) and income (e.g. salary) to have them calculated as a flat rate by this clever app. This way you don't have to deduct your rent every month or add your salary...but rather this is done for you automatically. This app can automatically deduct or add a fixed amount monthly or annually, so you are spared a lot of work. \n\nSimply enter your flexible expenses each time and add a short commentary if you like. So if, for example, you go shopping simply enter that you spent € 20 at the shops. The date is then automatically added and your expense is booked. \n\nNext time you go shopping, you don't have to type in \"Shopping\" as this item will be suggested to you automatically. Simply add the amount you spent. \n\nOf course, this system works the other way round as well. When you have income, for example you sell your old television on Ebay and earn € 50, you can book that amount in just a few seconds and this way never lose overview of your finances. \n\nSo you don't lose the complete overview however, you can also have graphically displayed in which month you had a positive or negative balance. This way you can oversee the whole year and determine when you spent a lot and on what you spent your money on.  \n\nTo recognize in advance when it could become difficult at the end of a month again, it is displayed to you what percentage of the month still remains and how much money you have at your disposal. This way you know in advance, for example, that you still have half the month to go but only have € 200 to spend. Therefore, start saving! \n\nThis app is an investment which pays for itself on day one and turns into profit after that. \n\nAdditionally, it should be mentioned that studies have proven that people who use (household) account books handle their money more consciously and end up with more money at the end of the month than people who do not. This is mainly explained by those people asking themselves if they really need that € 2 packet of chewing gum or if it is simply a pointless expense which will haunt them at the end of the month."

      "label": "More than 30 years ago we saw the birth of the most popular financial calculator ever created--you probably had one (and probably still do!).\n\nCalculator12 puts a rock solid emulation of that calculator on your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, whether you need it for school or are looking to retire old faithful. What you get is true (albeit non-programmable) emulation with 100% compatible operation keystroke for screentap and computational and operational reliability every bit as good as the original.\n\nBut wait, there's more! (sorry about that). Calculator12 is not stuck in the 80s. You have the option to work with cash flows in the cash flow diagram format, changing values or inserting/deleting cash flows with just a tap. Three independent cash flow scenarios can be evaluated side-by-side, and with capital multiplication you can evaluate an exit strategy for outside investors. Results can be emailed from Calculator12 so you don't have to redo things like an amortization schedule or comparative investment report at your lap or desktop. \n\nAnd you can see what was once hidden... the contents of the financial registers or optionally the stack are always displayed. For me at least confirming the accuracy of my entries relieves a lot of anxiety and prevents confusion when the results don't stack up. It's not programmable, but advance payment leasing functions have been pre-programmed in as well as conversions to APR and Effective Rate to fill some of the gaps. And it is blisteringly fast--what used to take 30 seconds now is done almost before your finger leaves the touchscreen. \n\nCalculator12 was the very first emulator of that physical machine on the App Store, v1.0 released July 30th of 2008, introducing features (now almost universally copied) that take advantage of the unique features of iOS to improve your ability to deal with financial problem solving. There are lots of emulators now, but only one that has moved out of the 80s. (this one!)\n\n*** This application listing provides an upgrade path for early adopters to the redesigned and renamed Calc-12E. It is identical to Calc-12E and is maintained on the App Store to provide a way for existing customers to upgrade their original purchase to Calc-12E free-of-charge... It will appear on your home screen as Calc12E***"

Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

Non financial data, such as the change in mileage and average fuel consumption can also be calculated, and displayed in brief or in detail. \n\nA carbon footprint can also be calculated, depending on the consumption of the vehicle, as well as the mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) it produces (total and average per day and per mile traveled). \n\nCar Manager also allows all these data (costs, fill-ups, vehicle information) to be exported and sent by e-mail directly from your iPhone as a CSV file (comma separated values, which can opened and processed by Excel or any other spreadsheet program), should you feel the need to create your own personalized statistics. \n\nThe application also enables you to manage a directory containing all the information about the service providers for your vehicles: insurance companies, garages, stores, clubs, associations, etc. You can then easily locate them thanks to the Maps interface. \n\nCar Manager also provides you with a Tools section, which allows you to geolocate your current position or your parking spot in a single click, so you can easily go back there later with the integrated GPS visual guiding function (or with Maps directions). This tools section can also help you find various services around your location: gas stations, garages, restaurants, hotels and others. \n\nCar Manager also gives you the opportunity to stay tuned to car news: it comes with a number of RSS feeds (internet information channels) allowing you to be informed of anything related to cars and motorsports. You can of course add any RSS feed you want. \n\nThe application automatically adapts itself to the units of measurement effective in your country: kilometers or miles for distances, liters or gallons for fuel. \n\niOS 7.1 or higher. \nUniversal application with full resolution support for iPad"

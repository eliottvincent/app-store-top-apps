      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

Under the watchful eye of the documentary crew, you'll be brewing espresso, steaming and frothing milk, and crafting eye-catching layered drinks for your picky customers.  Work your way through the holidays as you serve seasonal coffee and cannoli, unlock new ingredients, and earn Daily Specials with delicious latte and macchiato recipes.\n\n-- GAME FEATURES --\n\nBREW ESPRESSO AND LAYER DRINKS - Use the Brew Machines to make freshly-brewed shots of espresso, and to steam and froth milk for the customers' drinks.

Complete the drink with toppings, whips, and drizzles for that finishing touch.\n\nCRAFTING CANNOLI - Customers will order a custom-made cannoli along with their Papaccino drinks.

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

This is Street Kart Racing.\n\nThe road to f1 / nascar / indycar /  all starts in a kart. \n\nBRING IT ON\nOriginal and ultra competitive, real racing game, SK is it. \n\n\t⁃\tThe No.1 go kart game on mobile\n        -       Awesome physics.\n\t⁃\tChallenging, fun, rewarding.\n\t⁃\tNo Assists. No Excuses. Real racing tiers up to 80 mph.\n\t⁃\tTested for authenticity by hundreds of go kart - rally - stock car racing drivers including world champions. \n\n- YOUR GOAL -\nGo Karts: All F1, nascar, indycar, rally drivers start in cadet Karts - and so do you:\n\n\t⁃\tRace Real People on Real Tracks\n\t⁃\tBeat EVERYONE to become world go kart champion\n\t⁃\tSingle & multiplayer competition\n\n- SK FACEBOOK KARTING COMMUNITY -\nSure we’re on the grid to win.

Assoluto racing to go cart racers. Even F1 racing drivers play SK. \n\nwww.facebook.com/groups/streetkartracing\n\n- GO KARTING STRATEGY -\n- WEATHER: If it is raining at the track in real life it is raining in the game. We simulate everything. Rain, drizzle, hot and cold temperatures affect tire choice and grip. Air pressure affects the power delivered by the engine, speed and your lap time. More thought than your average racing game.\n- CHOICE: Like F1, Indycar, Gear Club or Nascar games - a range of tire compounds from different brands.\n- RIVALRIES:  Win personal battles and earn sponsorship.\n- UPGRADES: Make complex kart choices: exhaust, seats, brakes, fuel, engines, tyre pressures and setup.. \n\n-----  KEY FEATURES -----\nWe’re the no.1 go kart game. Here’s why:\n- Street Kart Racing is about epic rivalries against real people.\n- Close: Race in closely matched go karts - none of this massive upgrade, automatic win! We race in tenths!\n- Compete against pro racing drivers! Yes they play Street Kart Racing Game.\n- Real Tracks. Our grid: PFI, Adria, Wackersdorf, Mariembourg, Las Vegas Todd Road, and many more. No F1 tracks here.\n\n- KART RACING  -\nLike Assoluto Racing - practice in solo mode with the 2018 World Champions Rosberg Racing Academy. Improve set ups and racing skills with test real racing lines. Test out different physics setups. \n\n- SOCIAL -\nwww.instagram.com/streetkart\nwww.youtube.com/streetkart\n\nRACE PASS SUBSCRIPTION - SUPPORT THE DEVS\nBy joining as an SK Race Pass Member, you are agreeing to an auto-renewing monthly subscription plan (unless auto-renew is turned off) that will automatically be charged every month through your iTunes account for $4.99 within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.

Hungry predators and sub-human creatures, they all want a piece of you. The elements, combined with radiation and unexplained phenomenon, make the lovely looking environment a place where you shouldn’t be.  Yet, here you are.\n \nScavenge for resources inside any building and especially the landmarks of Pripyat: hotel Polissya, the cultural center, cinema Prometheus, the swimming pool and all the abandoned flat buildings. Craft and choose your gear wisely. Discover and use the campsites for safely passing the nights.  Equipment, weapons and the vehicles you may find and use are your only friends.\n \nGood luck!"

For example using the Modifier 'Massive' will increases the item's size by 18%, while Legendary adds 5-15% to every trait!\n\nNow you can get any item in Terraria and use it in your own worlds or any multiplayer worlds.  Need more items? No problem, open the app and get some more!\n\nThere's no extra charges or in app purchases, you can really get as many items as you like forever!\n\nAnother world first in the Plug series of apps - we've been bringing you commands, inventory add ons and mods in the Minecraft world for years, now it's time for something amazing for Terraria :). Be sure to check out our developer page to see our other apps in case you missed them.\n\nDisclaimer – This is a third party App, it is not the game Terraria or Minecraft and is not affiliated with the game, or its creators in any way."

      "label": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!"

      "label": "---\nJuly 18, 2014\nGamepad support has been added.\n---\nInitially released in Japan in 1993, Secret of Mana took the world by storm with its innovative real-time battle system and gorgeously rendered world. It continues to stand out among other action RPGs for its seamless gameplay that anyone from beginner to veteran can enjoy.\nOne of the most memorable elements of the Mana series is the Ring Command menu system. With the single press of a button, a ring-shaped menu appears on the screen, where players can use items, change weapons, and do a variety of other actions without needing to switch screens. This Ring Command menu system for which the Mana series is so well known was first introduced in Secret of Mana and has since appeared in most games in the series.\nPlay as Randi and his two companions, Primm and Popoi, as they adventure all around the world. At the center of our epic story is the mystical power of Mana. Battle the empire in its quest for control of Mana. Befriend the eight elementals who wield the forces of nature itself. Numerous encounters await at every turn.\n\nAdditional Information (reference only):\nESRB Rating: E10+ with Mild Fantasy Violence and Mild Suggestive Themes\n\n------------\n1993年8月6日,《聖劍傳說2》在超級任天堂上發售,以當時的新概念系統“動作戰鬥”博得了相當的人氣。這是一款將指令戰鬥的戰略性融入到即時、無縫戰鬥中的角色扮演遊戲,無論新手還是老玩家都能從中體驗到充分的爽快感。\n\n“指令環”是《聖劍》系列的特色系統之一。按鍵後畫面上會出現環形的選單,不需要切換畫面就可以使用道具、更換武器,是一種非常方便的系統。這一系統在《聖劍傳說2》裏首次登場,之後為整個系列所傳承。\n\n玩家將操作主人公Randi,以及他的夥伴Primm和Popoi行動,隨著劇情的展開而前往世界各地冒險。本作劇情的關鍵,是肉眼無法看見的強大力量“瑪娜”。與覬覦瑪娜之力的帝國軍隊作戰、邂逅掌管自然之力的精靈們……在他們冒險的旅途中,將會有諸多有趣的故事在前方等待著。"

      "label": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens."

Whether it’s decorating cupcakes or creating a piñata for her friends, each experience is unique and pinkatastic in its own way!\n\n\nDESIGN A PARTY\n• Locations – Choose from four unique locations: Peter’s bedroom, Pinkalicious’ bedroom, the Pinkerton’s backyard, the zoo, Pinkville Green, or the beach! \n• Invitations – Customize an invitation using stationery, paints, and stickers, and then save it to your device.\n• Cupcakes – Decorate some tasty treats with pinkerrific frosting, sprinkles, and colorful wrappers. Then, serve the cupcakes to Pinkalicious, Peter, and all of their friends!\n• Music Maker – Experiment with music and try all the party horns, listening to their different sounds and notes as you pass them out to characters and make your own songs.\n• Photobooth – Take a photo, pick a photo from your device, or use a character's photo to decorate and frame at the party. The decorated photo will be saved to the device to view and share with family and friends!\n• Piñata – Choose your favorite shape and dunk it in paint and decorations, then break open the piñata to see the treats inside!\n \n\nCREATIVITY & ARTS \n• Every activity was designed for kids to use art, music and imagination to create a party that is uniquely their own!   \n• Each location is filled with interactions your child can explore: tapping decorations to change them, moving the characters, and finding little surprises hidden in each party.\n\n\nABOUT PINKALICIOUS & PETERRIFIC™\nBased on the best-selling books by Victoria Kann, Pinkalicious & Peterrific™ is a PBS KIDS series produced by WGBH and Sixteen South that explores the arts, creativity, and self-expression.

      "label": "The acclaimed F/A-18 Hornet combat flight simulation by Graphsim Entertainment comes to iPhone and iPad in it's best incarnation to date. With unmatched depth and realism, there's nothing else like it on mobile devices!\n\nFEATURES\n• High-fidelity physics-based aircraft flight dynamics.\n• Realistic HUD, cockpit and weapon systems.\n• Intense, white-knuckle aerial combat.\n• Innovative control overlay system for pilot input.\n• Ruthless AI means skilled enemies and wingmen.\n• Scoring system with awards and rank promotions.\n• Full support for your GAME CONTROLLER.*\n• Complete step-by-step guided FLIGHT SCHOOL tutorials.\n• Create your own mission with the SORTIE editor.\n• Quickly enter combat with the DOGFIGHT generator.\n• Fly 50 challenging CAMPAIGN missions.\n• LAN MULTIPLAYER mode for up to four nearby players.\n• Watch a REPLAY of your campaign mission.\n\nPilot the awesome F/A-18 Hornet in this highly realistic fighter jet simulation. Using physical properties of the actual aircraft, the simulation flies just like the real thing.\n\nInteractive control overlays make it easy to use the extensive cockpit systems. It not only allows for input, but also provides feedback for aircraft systems such as radar mode or landing gear status. You control the aircraft's flight stick by rotating and tilting your device, or optionally using a compatible game controller.\n\nAcquire a target on the realistically simulated AN/APG-65 radar. Then launch an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile and watch it track its target with its realistically simulated guidance system.\n\nBecause the game captures performance differences between aircraft, aerial combat is highly realistic. So when you tangle with an enemy MiG-27, real-world tactics can save your day.\n\nEnemy pilots are skilled adversaries, proficient in dogfighting as well as ground attack. You may find yourself in a turning battle with a MiG-21 while simultaneously evading a SAM missile. If you can survive, you've earned bragging rights.\n\nConnect up to four nearby players (within Bluetooth range or connected to the same Wi-Fi access point) for exciting real-time air-to-air combat.\n\nDirect your wingman to fly in formation or to come to your aid. Request landing clearance from the control tower or get guidance from the Landing Signal Officer on final approach to a carrier landing.\n\nThe game includes 16 practice missions and 50 campaign missions. Increase your score with each mission and with every downed enemy aircraft. Earn awards and promotions as your career advances. Hours of gameplay wait.\n\nYou'll get a taste of what it's like to be fighter pilot. If you're interested in aviation, or military history, then FA-18 Hornet is for you. \n\n*iOS 13 now allows you to connect your Bluetooth PS-4 or XBOX ONE game controller."

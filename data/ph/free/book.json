Kindle books you have purchased on Amazon will automatically appear in your app. Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime members can select and download Kindle books directly in the app.\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT GREAT READ\n• Read the books you buy on Amazon in the Kindle app. Choose from over six million Kindle books (including those with Audible narration), magazines, and comics and start reading in seconds. Explore Amazon Charts best sellers and titles across genres like romance, science fiction, children’s books, self-help, religion, nonfiction, and more—and try any book with a free sample straight from the Kindle app.\n\n• Kindle Unlimited members can enjoy unlimited reading and listening, with the freedom to explore over 1 million titles, thousands of audiobooks, and current magazines. \n\n• Over 1,000 books, magazines, comics, and more included with Amazon Prime.\n\n• Kindle Vella brings you stories released one short episode at a time. The first three episodes of every story are always free--after that, purchase Tokens and redeem them to unlock episodes. Tokens may only be used to unlock Kindle Vella story episodes and are available for In-App purchase. Kindle Vella and In-App purchase of Tokens are currently only available in the US. \n\nGO BEYOND PAPER\nTurn your iPhone or iPad into a book with the free Kindle app—so you can read anytime, anywhere. Explore these reading features in the Kindle app:\n\n• Read your way. Customize your text size, font type, margins, text alignment, and orientation (portrait or landscape)—and choose whether to turn pages from left to right or continuously scroll. Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

You are then given the opportunity to purchase the physical, digital or audio version of the book.\n\nEnable your notifications and receive custom \"Booky Calls\" twice a week with up to three hand-selected books looking for a \"book-up\" based on your personal profile preferences."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "The “Little Stories” series is a collection of fairy tales in which your kid plays the main role. It's quite simple – just enter your kid's name and gender into the settings window and enjoy reading fairy tales about your son or daughter.\n\nTo make it even cooler, we've added beautiful melodies and wonderful pictures to help you raise your child by giving him or her only positive examples. Moreover, you can also make your own audiobooks! Just spend a few minutes to voice-over the story.\n\nLet love and kindness fill your family’s leisure time to make your life and the world around you happier!\n\nWhy “Little Stories”?\n• 1800+ pictures\n• Gender determines the choice of illustrations\n• 45 exciting fairy tales so far and more to come\n• Enchanting music accompanies each story\n• You can create audiobooks by recording your own voice!\n• 1st place in the “Entertainment” category of Rating Runet in 2018!\n• 1st place in the “App For Kids” category of Golden App in 2016!\n• 3rd place in the “Entertainment” category of Golden App in 2017!\n\nWe’d like to tell you more about the process behind creating stories for kids so that you have a better idea about the hard work we put into “Little Stories”.\n\n1) It all begins with searching for an author. He/she can live in any country of the world, but the important thing is that he/she is able to create an interesting and insightful story. Before writing a bedtime story, the author has to read the conditions first. For example, the story may not contain more than 50 scenes (each of which can consist of 146 symbols max.) otherwise the text won’t fit into the app. Once the story has been completed, the next stage can begin.\n\n2) It is now  time to create the storyboard. A storyboard is a selection of simple sketches for each of the illustrations of the story. It gives us a better idea about the visual images of the children’s story.\n\n3) Once the storyboard has been approved, we move on to searching for an illustrator. It should be noted that not all styles might be appropriate for a certain bedtime story and, therefore, it’s important to achieve a perfect fit between the story and the illustration style.\n\n4) Meanwhile, the composer creates the melody. Both the story itself and the artist’s illustrations serve as inspiration for the creation of music. The composer also has conditions to meet: the melody must be soothing and prepare children for a good night’s sleep since most often stories are read for bedtime.\n\n5) What’s more, we also translate our stories for kids into other languages.\n\n6) But that’s not the end! It’s important to see how the book for kids looks inside the app. Line breaks should be checked to make sure the text looks nice and neat. This is done by two professionals: the programmer and the tester.\n\n7) Only after this final step do we release the story for kids. This entire process might take anywhere from two to nine months. So, it’s a hard, but interesting, journey!\n\nWe continuously add new fairy tales to our collection! \nFairy tales are designed for kids aged 3+.\n\nFollow us on: facebook.com/diveomedia"

Kabilang sa tipáng ito ang pagmamana ng Israel ng Canaan o \"Lupang Pangako\" at ang proteksiyón at pagpapalà ni YHWH kapalít ng pagsunód ng Israel sa kaniyang mga utos (Exodo 6:4).\nBagong Tipán\nAng Bagong Tipán ay naglalaman ng mga salaysay tungkol sa karakter na si Hesús at ang kanyang mensahe ng kaligtasan sa kanyang mga alagád. Si Hesús ay nagpakakilala na tagapágligtás sa pagwawakás ng mundó na magaganáp noong unang siglo CE (Mateo 24:34, Marcos 13:30, Marcos 8:12, Marcos 8:38, Marcos 9:19, Lukas 21:32, Mateo 10:23). Ayon kay Hesús, siya ay maghaharì mulâ sa kaniyang trono ng kaluwalhatian kasama ang kaniyang mga Apostól upang humatol sa 12 lipì ng Israel (Mateo 19:28). Bukód dito, si Hesús ay nag-angkín rin na isang diyós, at Mesiyas na naging sanhi ng pagkakahatol sa kanya ng sanhedrin ng parusang kamatayan (Lukas 22:66-71, Juan 10:33).[\nNagmula ang salitang Bibliya ng Tagalog at ang Bible ng Ingles mula sa Griyegong biblia na nangangahulugang \"mga aklat\" o \"mga maliliit na aklat.\" Hinango naman ang Griyegong biblia mula sa isa pa nilang salita: ang biblos, na lumalarawan sa panloob na bahagi ng halamang papirus, isang sangkap sa paggawa ng sinaunang mga papel. May isang lugar sa Phoenicia, ang lungsod ng Gebal, na tinaguriang \"Byblos\" ng mga Griyego dahil kilala ang pook sa paggawa ng papel na papirus.\nTanakh o Lumang Tipan\nAng mga aklat ng Tanakh o Lumang Tipan ay orihinal na isinulat sa alpabetong Paleo-Hebreo. Bago matuklasan ang Dead Sea Scrolls sa kweba ng Qumran noong 1947 hanggang 1956, ang pinakamatandang pragmentaryong (hindi kumpleto) manuskrito ng Hebreo ang Nash Papyrus na isinulat mula 150 hanggang 110 BCE. Ang pinakamatandang kumpletong manuskrito ng Lumang Tipan (Tanakh) ay Codex Sinaiticus (ika apat na siglo CE) na kinopya mula sa Griyegong Salin na Septuagint. Ang Septuagint ay isinalin sa Griyego mula Hebreo noong ikatlo hanggang ika isang siglo BCE. Sa mga panahong ito ang Israel ay nasa ilalim ng imperyong Griyego. Ang Septuagint ang pinagkuhanan ng sipi (quotes) ng Lumang Tipan ng mga may akda ng Bagong Tipan at ng mga \"ama ng simbahan\".\nBagong Tipan\nAng mga aklat ng Bagong Tipan ay orihinal na isinulat sa Griego. Ang mga kauna unahang salin ng Bagong Tipan sa ibang lenggwahe ay kinabibilangan ng lumang Latin (ika 2 siglo CE), lumang Syriac (ika 4 hanggang ika 5 siglo CE), at Coptic (ikaapat na siglo CE). Isa pang salin sa Latin bukod sa \"lumang Latin\" ang Vulgata na isinalin ni Jerome (342–420 CE). Ang Peshitta na isinalin sa lenggwaheng Syriac ang bibliang ginagamit sa iglesiang Syriac."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

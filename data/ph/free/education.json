Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words.

Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises.

They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

ABC Puzzles are the perfect gentle introduction to LETTER NAMES, SHAPES, and SPELLING.====\n\nLearning ABCs has never been simpler! In this fun educational puzzle game, toddlers and preschoolers learn to recognize letter names, build familiarity with shapes of uppercase and lowercase letters, associate each letter with a variety of objects whose name begins with that letter, and spell basic words. By acquiring familiarity with letter names and shapes in this way, children develop a solid foundation for success on their early reading journey.\n\nRecommended age range: 2-4 years.\n\nLet your children explore the shapes and names of letters with this new fun app developed by an award-winning educational publisher, 22learn, the creator of the best-selling Abby Basic Skills app.\n\nVARIETY OF FUN LEARNING INTERACTIONS\n* 5 simple games for each letter (letter puzzle mode) and one game for spelling (word puzzle mode) provide a variety of learning interactions that children enjoy.\n* For example, children love to pop balloons with a letter they are learning – as they progress in the game, the weather changes in the background and reveals a beautiful rainbow once children master the letter!\n* In the letter puzzle mode, children 1) drag uppercase and lowercase letters to their matching shades, 2) associate the letters with pictures of words whose name begins with those letters, 3) tap on fun letter balloons to hear letter names as they pop the balloons, and 4) compose shapes of each individual letter.\n* In the word puzzle mode, children match letters with their shapes to spell a word.\n\nBUILD FOR INDEPENDENT EXPLORATION\n* ABC Puzzles is designed from the ground up to enable young children’s independent play and foster their sense of competence as they independently navigate the game environment to select which letters or words they wish to practice.\n* All the items to be moved are large enough to be easily grasped by children’s fingers.\n* No complicated menus have to be accessed by a child in order to play the game on his or her own.\n\nPOSITIVE, ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENT\n* Only positive reinforcement is provided to engage children.\n* Full of colorful illustrations that children love.\n\nABC Puzzles feature a beautiful, bright, colorful design and simple interface that children love. We hope your children enjoy this gentle introduction to the world of letters the same way that our little beta-testers did!"

      "label": "Archer NCLEX – with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!\n\nOver the past decade, Archer Review has provided \"extremely affordable and highly successful\" courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.\n\nArcher NCLEX Question banks include:\n\n- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.\n\n- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.\n\n- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.\n\n- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.\n\n- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress – we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the \"previous tests\" button\n\n- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev\n\n- \"Peer Stats\" gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.\n\n- Video Rationales: Our unique \"Video rationales\" accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer's master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through \"audio-visual reinforcement\" while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.\n\n- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.\n\n- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented."

In addition to the basic operations, take advantage of a variety of built-in functions for exploring trigonometry, statistics, combinatorics, and more. Or, define and evaluate your own functions -- all for free.\n\nAt Desmos, we imagine a world of universal math literacy where math is accessible and enjoyable for all students. To that end, we’ve built a simple yet powerful scientific calculator that runs on the same blazingly fast math engine as our next-generation graphing calculator, but with a more streamlined set of features, for those times when you just don’t need a graph. It’s intuitive, beautiful, and completely free.\n\nFeatures:\n\nArithmetic: In addition to the basic operations, the scientific calculator also supports exponentiation, radicals, absolute value, logarithms, rounding, and percentages.\n\nTrigonometry: Evaluate the fundamental trigonometric functions and their inverses, using either radians or degrees for angle measure.\n\nStatistics: Compute the mean and standard deviation (sample or population) of a list of data.\n\nCombinatorics: Count combinations and permutations and calculate factorials.\n\nOther features:\n- Works offline, no internet connection required.\n- Create and evaluate your own functions using familiar function notation.\n- Assign values to variables for later use.\n- View multiple expressions at once. Unlike many scientific calculators, all of your previous work remains visible on the screen.\n- The “ans” key always holds the value of your last computation so that you never have to remember or copy a result. If you change an earlier expression, the “ans” value updates automatically.\n- Did we mention it’s free?"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

RANKED #1 APP FOR KIDS on APP Store in many countries. \n\nLet's come and play with me! \nThis new user-friendly wonderful Abby's Magic Laptop for Preschool and Toddlers welcomes you to the colorful world of exploration and learning! This adorable learn and play laptop teaches children letters, numbers, colors, shapes, animals, toys, fruits, musical instruments, and more. Kids will love switching between categories. Actions lead to learning!\n\nThe application offers you in total the possibility of choosing from 12(!) thematic categories. Children will be thrilled to play with this laptop and learn new things.  The numerous buttons the laptop offers invite exploration and enable children to determine their own pace of learning according to their individual needs.\n\nThe laptop includes two game modes: 'Let's Play!' and 'Let's Learn!' The switching between the modes is made easy by two large red buttons. Children typically do not experience problems learning to activate these two modes, but in case they do, we encourage parents to switch the mode\nfor their children.\n\n*Let's Play!*\nThe 'Let's Play!' mode is designed primarily for children unfamiliar with the objects included, or those who want to refresh and enhance their knowledge of the already acquired vocabulary. To activate the mode, simply press the 'Let's play!' button,  and choose a desired thematic category from one of the blue buttons in the upper half of the gaming space. For instance, after pressing a blue button with a picture of a ball, there are going to appear buttons with toys theme on the lower half of the gaming screen. When pressing the individual picture buttons then, the pictures are going to appear enlarged on the laptop monitor, the pronounced name and the written form of the word as well as its authentic sound and small animation follows afterwards.\n\n*Let's Learn!*\nDo you want some practice too? Don't forget to try the 'Let's Learn!' mode! To activate this mode, tap on the 'Let's Learn' button. Afterwards, choose one of the twelve thematic categories and let the challenge begin! When the category has been selected, an enthusiastic monkey Abby appears on the laptop monitor and gives tasks to a child. The task is always to select the picture of the correct item that she pronounced. Of course, after each correct answer, the cute monkey provides words of praise and\nencouragement.\n\nTo make the laptop more engaging, we also included four colorful buttons in the lower half of the game screen. These simulate the functions of a videophone and include such funny effects such as entertaining sound effects and melodies.\n\nThank you for selecting our app! We sincerely hope your children will enjoy it!\n\nYour 22learn team!"

      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

Today, this decorative type of writing is still popular. It is used to decorate texts, logo’s, menus, postcards, wedding stationery and documents by forming, arranging and decorating the shapes and symbols of words. Calligraphy is a great way to relax and let your creativity flow.\n\nExplore both traditional and modern calligraphy examples in the app. Traditional calligraphy involves the practice of certain script styles and aims for a uniform shape of letters with fixed proportions. Modern calligraphy, sometimes called ‘faux calligraphy’ or ‘hand lettering’, is a big trend over the last few years. It relies on the fundamentals of traditional calligraphy, but doesn’t follow its strict rules, allowing for more freedom to play around and create unique pieces of art. In modern calligraphy, often different lettering styles are combined in one composition.\n\nOnly a few tools are needed to start working on your calligraphy design ideas. It is traditionally practiced with dip pens, but brush pens are also popular today. Furthermore, you’ll need some paper and possibly also a pencil to sketch out the design idea concept. A ruler can be used to create straight lines or accurate grids. In calligraphy, the thickness of pen strokes is controlled by pressure with the general rule that strokes going down are thick and strokes going up are thin. Practice different amounts of pressure and angles of your hand to create smooth lines and fluid strokes.\n\nWhether you're new to calligraphy or a master calligrapher, boost your creativity with this calligraphy design ideas app!\n\nIf you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please contact calligraphy@wienelware.nl"

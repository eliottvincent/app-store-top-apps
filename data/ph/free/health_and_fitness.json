Visit records will be automatically removed after 31 days.\n\nIf there is confirmed case in a venue located in Hong Kong, the mobile app will notify those users who have visited the same venue at the same time with the infected person(s), thus increasing vigilance and self-protection awareness of citizens as well as enhancing public confidence in visiting different venues.\n\nUpon confirmation by Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, app users who are confirmed positive or preliminary positive of COVID-19 infection can share their visit history with the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health to help trace the relevant contacts.\n\nThe mobile app allows the app users to store their Vaccine Pass records (e.g. COVID-19 vaccination records, vaccination medical exemption certificate and recovery record, provisional vaccine pass) and testing record. The mobile app automatic displays the app users selected Vaccine Pass QR code after scanning a venue QR code to facilitate the compliance with the “Vaccine Pass” measure. The Vaccine Pass QR code stored in the mobile app will be changed to red color if it is belonged to a COVID-19 infected person, and to amber code if it is belonged to a person under medical surveillance according to Department of Health’s records for the purpose of fighting the pandemic.\n\nThe mobile app also provides a Testing Registration Code function to enable app users to voluntarily store their personal information in advance. This function aims to reduce the time spent on queuing on-site and registration at testing points through a simplified registration process for app users to conduct COVID-19 nucleic acid testing if needed.\n\nThe LeaveHomeSafe mobile app is developed under the supervision by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/privacy \nPersonal Information Collection Statement: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/personal-information-collection-statement"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Games that move you.\n\nActive Arcade is a fresh take on how to get active while having fun, just by playing a few simple games. It puts you inside the game and uses your natural body movement as the game controller. Interactive elements will make you feel like you're immersed in an entirely new type of arcade game. It's a whole new world of play.\n\n__\n\nWhile we all want to be healthy, fitness today is expensive, rigorous, time-consuming, and intimidating. In short, “fitness” today is just too hard for many.\n\nActive Arcade is an entirely different approach. It’s a simple, natural way to get active just by playing fun games that use your body movement. Like the casual sports games that we play on the playground as kids, there is no better way to have fun and get your body moving than by playing and competing in physical games. Active Arcade is built for anyone to get moving with only their mobile device—no expensive equipment, no hardcore routines, no wearables.\n\nEven if just for a few minutes a day, moving through Active Arcade is both fun and good for you. Simply use your body to play fun physical games and activities, and get immersed in the gameplay. You won't even know you’re working up a sweat!\n\nDon't exercise. Just play.\n\n__\n\nA NEW TYPE OF GAMEPLAY\n\nYour body is now a video game controller! Active Arcade uses advanced full-body motion tracking powered by AI, combined with gamification and augmented reality (AR) to make the experience fun for everyone. The camera will digitize your movement and power the gameplay in real-time. \n\nSIMPLE SETUP, PLAY ANYWHERE\n\nActive Arcade requires no special setup, wearables, or extra equipment. Just lean your iPhone or iPad against a stationary object like a chair, water bottle, or wall, and ensure the front-facing camera can see your full body.  For an even more immersive living room experience, connect your device to a TV through AirPlay or HDMI connection.\n\nSOMETHING FOR EVERYONE\n\nActive Arcade is simple and accessible so that people of all ages and every ability level can engage. The games are easy to play and don't require advanced athletic skills. There are more casual games like Reaction that focus on hand-eye coordination, and more full-body games like Box Attack that use your athleticism. A wide variety of games are available for every player, with new games added regularly.\n\nFUN WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY\n\nLike real sports activities, Active Arcade games are about playing and moving with friends and family members. But unlike many connected fitness solutions, Active Arcade makes engaging with friends and family a quick and simple activity that can happen anytime, anyplace. 2-Player game modes get you and your friends playing side-by-side.\n\nCAPTURE AND SHARE YOUR BEST MOVES\n\nLike a built-in photo booth, you’ll get instant highlights from your time in Active Arcade that shows off your best moves and are fun to post on social media—complete with all the interactive elements included. Post your highlights on social media and challenge your friends to get active too!\n\nENTIRELY FREE TO PLAY\n\nActive Arcade is free to play and contains no advertising, in-app purchases, or subscription model. It's an entirely free resource for the community and for everyone anywhere to play and engage. Share it with all your friends, family members, or anyone.\n\nGot any questions or feedback?\nPlease shoot us an email at ios-support@activearcade.ai. We'd love to hear from you."

When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility.

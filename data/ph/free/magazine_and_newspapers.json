Earful is free and it always will be.\n\nEVERYONE GETS AN EARFUL\nThe current market is saturated with text-to-speech apps that cost upwards of $150/year to use, are plastered with ads, or have time limits. We created Earful as a free alternative for anyone to use text-to-speech to listen to articles right within their browser. Whether you’re a student that processes better with auditory senses, a mom trying to “read” the latest article on the New York Times in the middle of the night while rocking a baby to sleep, or a business person keeping an eye on the latest trends - Earful is here to help.\n\nEarful works best with articles, and it's not optimized for reading other websites like stores, search engines, etc. On-device accessibility features are best suited for those purposes."

      "label": "Founded in Edinburgh in 1979, Literary Review attracts contributors who are irreverent, accomplished and amusing. It is a trusted independent source for reviews of new books in history, biography, politics, travel and fiction. It also has a monthly poetry competition with generous cash prizes.\n\nMartin Amis said: \"In Literary Review you find something that has almost vanished from the book pages: its contributors are actually interested in Literature.\"\n\nThe iPad/iPhone edition brings you selected pages from the latest issue as soon as it is published. Within the application you can upgrade to full access, which brings you every page of the issue and a searchable archive of back issues to August 2005. Issues are not sold individually - for the duration of your subscription you have access to every issue in this archive.\n\nDuring your subscription you can sync back issues to your device. These will remain in place if your subscription expires, unless your device removes them (for example when running low on disk space). Re-downloading issues requires a current subscription.\n\n• Swipe or tap the page edges to flip to next/previous page. \n• Use the animated thumbnail view to flick through the pages. \n• Pinch or double-tap pages to zoom. \n• Switch between single or double-page view. \n• Search the current issue or the archive. \n• Tap any page links to web sites, email addresses, phone numbers or maps. \n• Tap contents-page links to jump to a particular article. \n• Sync the latest issue to your device for offline reading (requires wi-fi). \n• Sync additional back issues by tapping the stars beside their names (requires wi-fi). \n• Network connection required otherwise. \n\nWe recommend first running the app within a wi-fi area so it can sync the latest issue to your device - after that you can use it anywhere. Subscribers will receive new issues automatically via Newsstand.\n\nSubscriptions are available within the app at the following prices:\n\n£3.99 per month\n£27.99 per year\n\nIn addition, please note the following standard features of auto-renewable iTunes subscriptions:\n\n• Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscriptions will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in iTunes after purchase.\n• No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nYou can find our privacy policy here:\n\nhttp://www.exacteditions.com/about/privacy\n\nand our terms of service here:\n\nhttp://www.exacteditions.com/about/tos"

We aim to provide multiple perspectives on trending news topics, through a highly involved curation process where Noa’s editors hand-pick the very best articles from the world's best publishers.\n\nIn a world with polarised opinions and ideology-driven media coverage, are you seeking multiple viewpoints? Start listening to Noa to save you time in exploring varying perspectives and to help you stay informed on the topics everyone is talking about.\n\nIt integrates easily into your daily or weekly routine. Listen while exercising, driving, cooking, or walking.\n\nTOP PUBLISHERS. ONE APP\nOur partnering publishers include\n\n• The Economist\n• Harvard Business Review\n• The Washington Post\n• The Telegraph\n• Bloomberg\n• The New York Times\n• Fast Company\n• Insider\n• MIT Technology Review\n• Foreign Affairs\n• The Independent\n• The Conversation\n• And more.\n\nOUR EDITORIAL PRINCIPLES\t\n1. Multiple Perspectives: Offer multiple perspectives from trusted sources and empower listeners to make up their own minds on where they stand on a topic.\n2. Thought-provoking: Present audio articles that inform, inspire, and offer fresh insights, through both a global and a national lens. Focus on opinion, feature, and analysis articles.\n3. Storytellers: Be storytellers and educators. Help our listeners understand global topics, and perspectives, while also telling the stories of the people behind the headlines.\n4. Global Impact: Ensure coverage and raise awareness of important topics, regardless of a topics popularity or ability to drive “clicks”. \n5. Fourth Estate: Uphold journalism’s values as a democratic check on power. And always celebrate great journalism.\n6. Embrace Complexity: Encourage thought and avoid black and white explanations that aren't followed with depth. The world is complicated and can seldom be explained in minutes. Our goal is to help listeners navigate it. \n\nAUDIO STORIES\nListening to the best journalism is a great way to learn and grow, especially when you don’t have time to read. Audio articles are produced and recorded daily by Noa’s talented voice actors – Sam Scholl, Adrienne Walker, Peter Hanly, Martin Buchanan, Les Smith, Grainne Brookfield and Jessie McGee. They’re probably in the booth recording as you read this!\n\nAUDIO SERIES\nEach day, Noa’s editor’s select the very best audio articles and add them to topic-specific playlists. Every Series begins with a short explainer – written by a Noa editor – that provides valuable context on the subject at hand before you dive in.

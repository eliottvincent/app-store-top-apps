We hope it helps our students and citizens better interpret media and information. We hope it gives small local businesses a way to grow. Most of all, we hope this brings us all together around a common bond – the community we all live in.\n\nOur app will ask you for access to your camera and microphone. This is so that you can use the app to gather photos and videos and submit them to Citizen One for publishing . It will also ask you for permission to use your location. This is so we can send you messages based on where you are in the community. This could be anything from interesting content about where you are, special offers from partners and businesses you're nearby, or other useful information based on your location. Apple wants you to know that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. The app will still work without access to your location, but you may miss out on a lot of really cool, helpful, and valuable information."

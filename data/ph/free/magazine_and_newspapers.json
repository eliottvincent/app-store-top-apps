      "label": "No matter when or where, Portals of Prayer inspires you to live each day as a disciple of Christ. Through each daily audio-and-textual devotion, you meditate on God’s Word and see it working through you in your life. New updates allow for a seamless and easy-to-use interface, keeping you focused on your devotional time.\n\n\nWhat’s New?\r\n\nWelcome to the NEW Portals of Prayer App. There have been many updates to help make your experience seamless, from the subscription feature to how the devotions are displayed. Here’s a list of all the new features: \r\n\nNavigation Bar\r\n\nTwo features from the original navigation bar have now moved. The bottom still contains “Devotions” and “Favorites.” “Prayers” has now been renamed “Resources” to better represent its offerings. This tab will still be located on the bottom navigation bar. “Search” and “Settings” have been relocated to the top navigation bar. \r\n\nDevotions \r\n\nAn updated design allows for a sleek and modern devotions screen. Press the Play button in the middle of the image to hear your audio devotion. Swipe right or left to see previous or future devotions. \r\n\nArchives\r\n\nNot only can you search based on topic or month, but devotions are now also categorized based on year and quarter to make finding a devotion from the print version that much easier. \r\n\nResources\r\n\nThe “Prayers” tab is now called “Resources” and includes daily prayers, prayers for special occasions, and author biographies. \r\n\nSettings\r\n\nThe app now offers a dark mode for your reading convenience. \r\n\nFavorites\r\n\nThe app now syncs your favorites across all your devices so long as you use the same Concordia Publishing House account. \r\n\r\nAbout Portals of Prayer\r\n\nPortals of Prayer is a quarterly print devotional that has been a favorite for generations of readers. Since 1937, the meaningful daily devotions and ending prayers have offered a daily moment of time with God, comforting believers through their lives. \r\n\nConcordia Publishing House Portals of Prayer App Subscription\r\n\nWhile the Portals of Prayer App is free to download, you need a subscription to access all the amazing features. A new subscription is $9.99 per year and can be purchased through the app. Here’s what each subscription includes:\r\n-\tOver 10 years of Portals of Prayer content\r\n-\tDaily audio and textual devotions\r\n-\tMeaningful daily prayers\r\n-\tThe ability to mark the devotions you like best as “Favorite”\r\n\nYour yearly subscription will auto-renew unless the auto-renew feature is turned off. To avoid being charged with the auto-renewal, it must be turned off at least 24-hours prior to the renewal date. You can see the end date of your subscription in the app’s “Settings” tab.\r\n\nA subscription to the Portals of Prayer App does not, and is not, included in the print subscription to Portals of Prayer. These subscriptions are separate entities. \r\n\nPrivacy Policy and Terms of Service\r\n\nPlease visit https://www1.cph.org/portals/terms.aspx to view the terms and conditions of the Portals of Prayer App."

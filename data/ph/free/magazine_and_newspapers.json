      "label": "LISTEN TO THE TEXT ANYWHERE:  Musical Reader:Text-to-Speech is an app that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to customise your narration. Modify the voices of Amy, Joanna, and Mathew to best suit your needs. You may control aspects of speech, such as pronunciation, volume, pitch, speed rate, speaking mode, casual or formal, etc. \n \nTEXT WITH MUSIC: With neural AI narration, you can convert text to music. With this premium, high-fidelity voice, you may listen to news, stories, analyses, articles, reports, verses, quotes, poems, and much more. Select a different reading style. Discover a unique way to listen to text by combining several musical genres, including Lo-Fi, Summer, Movie, Natural, Atmospheric, and more.\n\nNARRATE OVER A VARIETY OF BACKGROUND MUSIC: Listen to the text while listening to popular music in the background. You can use your favourite music as a background and overlay it on the reader's screen. For your Instagram reel or Tiktok, create a popular voiceover.\n\nCONVERT TEXT INTO MP3 TO GET AUDIO FILES: With our advanced sound filters, you can tickle your musical senses, making it more fun! Pitch, music rollover time, pitch, and speaking mode can all be changed.Share your text-converted musical file with your friends and family. Listen to your creation in the history section. Export and share high-quality audio files. For Instagram reel voiceovers, use audio files.\n\nCHOOSE A VOICE AGE AND SPEAKING MODE:  Listen to voices that make you feel close to someone you know and read aloud like a toddler or a man reading in a baritone voice.\n\nUSEFUL FOR ALL TYPE OF DOCUMENTS: Make it a PDF reader by capturing a PDF, taking a screenshot, documenting, or importing a picture. Unlike most text-to-speech (TTS) voice aloud readers, this one is powered by powerful neural voices with great fidelity.\n\nSHARE YOUR CREATION AND LISTEN TO IT IN THE HISTORY SECTION: Musical Reader text-to-speech can read books, documents, and articles to you as you cook, work, commute, or do other things. All of this can be listened to by going to the history section where it is saved.\n\nWe're more than simply a text-to-speech app; we include original neural voices and music. Our text-to-voice technology gives customers complete control, which is a key differentiator for us.\nProfessionals, students, and persons with dyslexia, ADHD, A.D.D, low vision acuity, concussions, and other reading difficulties can benefit greatly from this app.\n\n\n\nWe used Amazon's POLLY voice library to build our neural engine.\n\n\"Musical Reader\" plan:\n* Monthly: $0.99 per month\n \nThese are the prices for customers in the United States.Pricing in other countries may vary, and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on the country of residence.\n \nPayments and Renewal:\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes Account upon purchase confirmation. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n* After purchasing, you can manage or disable auto-renewal in your account settings at any time.\n* No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active period.\n \nRead more about our privacy policy here -\nhttps://www.trilonapps.com/musicalreader/musicalreaderprivacypolicy\n \nRead more about our terms of service here -\nhttps://www.trilonapps.com/termsofservice"

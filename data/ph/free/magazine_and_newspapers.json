Earful is free and it always will be.\n\nEVERYONE GETS AN EARFUL\nThe current market is saturated with text-to-speech apps that cost upwards of $150/year to use, are plastered with ads, or have time limits. We created Earful as a free alternative for anyone to use text-to-speech to listen to articles right within their browser. Whether you’re a student that processes better with auditory senses, a mom trying to “read” the latest article on the New York Times in the middle of the night while rocking a baby to sleep, or a business person keeping an eye on the latest trends - Earful is here to help.\n\nEarful works best with articles, and it's not optimized for reading other websites like stores, search engines, etc. On-device accessibility features are best suited for those purposes."

      "label": "Founded in Edinburgh in 1979, Literary Review attracts contributors who are irreverent, accomplished and amusing. It is a trusted independent source for reviews of new books in history, biography, politics, travel and fiction. It also has a monthly poetry competition with generous cash prizes.\n\nMartin Amis said: \"In Literary Review you find something that has almost vanished from the book pages: its contributors are actually interested in Literature.\"\n\nThe iPad/iPhone edition brings you selected pages from the latest issue as soon as it is published. Within the application you can upgrade to full access, which brings you every page of the issue and a searchable archive of back issues to August 2005. Issues are not sold individually - for the duration of your subscription you have access to every issue in this archive.\n\nDuring your subscription you can sync back issues to your device. These will remain in place if your subscription expires, unless your device removes them (for example when running low on disk space).

Nos anos 80, em uma época dominada pelas grandes gravadoras, lançamos o Rock Brasil, dando visibilidade a várias bandas que se tornaram sucesso do gênero.\nEm 2015, rompemos a barreira do som ao colocar no ar a 1ª WEB RÁDIO TV do Brasil. Já no ano de 2017, passamos a gerar conteúdo exclusivo também para a TV por assinatura. Inauguramos, assim, um novo formato de programação - uma verdadeira experiência multiplataforma - ao transmitir ao vivo conteúdo próprio e simultâneo no Rádio, TV e Internet.\nEstamos presentes em 237 cidades de Minas Gerais pela 98FM e Claro TV (NET), além de alcance mundial com a 98Live."

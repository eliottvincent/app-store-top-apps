From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams.

You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases.

Bowling Ball Arsenal\n7. Notes\n8. Score Calculator\n9. Spare Names\n\n---\n\n1. Angles & Targeting\n\nPlan & visualize a shot from the start of your approach to your target, helping you become more accurate and consistent.⁠ Add overlays, such as entry angle, focal point, distance markers, and save favorite shots.\n\nVideo mode can apply all the above to previously recorded videos, or use camera more when practicing, with up to 30sec delay, for continuous action replay of every shot.\n\n---\n\n2. Axis Tilt & Rotation\n\nTake a photo or video of your ball with a PAP (Positive Axis Point) marker and position it in the guide for your approximate axis tilt and rotation.  Great for working on control & consistency.⁠\n\n---\n\n3. Ball Speed & RPM\n\nIn simple mode use the start/stop button to calculate ball speed in real time.Advanced mode can load in a video for more accuracy, and rev-rate calculation.⁠\n\n---\n\n4. Observation Trainer\n\nWhen we let go of the ball, many of us immediately look up to see the end result at the pins. We don't see the journey the ball takes to, and through, the pins, so don’t see differences between pocket hits that do and don’t carry. ⁠\n⁠\nPractice ANYWHERE with the Observation Trainer and learn to focus on four key points of every shot that give you the info you need to make better decisions and start striking more.\n\n---\n\n5. Pattern Library\n\nInstant access to details & diagrams of hundreds of oil patterns, or enter your own custom patterns. Load any pattern into Angles & Targeting to plot your shot directly over it and plan how you'll attack the lanes.\n\n---\n\n6. Bowling Ball Arsenal\n\nSearchable library of over 1,500 balls and a way to manage your own arsenal. Organise balls into separate bags and keep track of information such as surface, layout, important dates and more. When looking for something new, use the Ball Library to find exactly what you want, with filters for brand, cover & core types, RG, Diff and more.\n\n---\n\n7. Notes\n\nKeep track of information about your game and equipment. Create general notes, or add notes from within most of the other tools, such as for oil patterns, your bowling balls, Speed & RPM readings, Observation Trainer scores and more.\n\n---\n\n8. Score Calculator\n\nWhether earning how scoring works, teaching youth bowlers how to score, or just giving your brain a rest at a Triple-X fun night, there's lots of reasons the Score Calculator can come in handy!\n\n---\n\n9. Spare Names\n\nJust for fun, tap the pins to see nicknames of common spares you probably don’t want to be leaving!\n\n---\n\n\n\"Every bowler should have Tenpin Toolkit on every device they own.  It’s an incredible information source and provides so many things to help you learn, get better and challenge yourself.\"\n\nTim Mack\nUSBC Hall of Famer & Storm Director of Global Relations\n\n---\n\n\"A brilliant app with tools to help you develop and learn different skills. The observation trainer is a great way to train your eyes to start watching your ball go down the lane\"\n\nVerity Crawley\nPWBA Professional & SCAD Team Coach\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\nPremium features can be unlocked with an in-app subscription.

      "label": "■ Introduction\nTo win races, it is absolutely essential to set up your machine to best suit both you and the track conditions.\nTo facilitate this, Yamaha Motors has developed the PowerTuner app for the Yamaha YZ series and WR series (*1).\nYou can now quickly and easily adjust engine and suspension settings using the app to best suit every rider and any conditions.\nIn PowerTuner, all features are available at no additional cost!\n\n\nWant to set up the machine to run faster?\n⇒ Intuitive and easy settings. More detailed settings are also available. Make settings as per your choice by referring to the setup guide!\n\nWant to check the recorded usage information such as speed, throttle opening, engine speed, fuel consumption?\n⇒ You can now use your smartphone as a machine information monitor!\n\nWant to check how much your lap time improves after customizing the machine settings in the app?\n⇒ Measure your times lap-by-lap with the connected button on the machine!\n\n(*1) Depending on the machine, some functions may not be available.\n\n■ Description\n･Mapping\n　There are three setting types:\n　(1) Fuel Injection (FI) and Ignition (IG)\n　　Intuitive and easy adjustment by selecting \"Smooth ⇔ Aggressive\". If you want more detailed settings, you can adjust each with 16 points (4 x 4) according to the engine speed / throttle opening.\n　(2) Traction Control\n　　Adjust the level of intervention in 3 levels.\n　(3) Launch Control\n　　Set the \"Rev limit\" for launches.\n･Monitor\n　The race log, failure diagnostics, machine status, vehicle speed, throttle opening, engine speed, fuel consumption, water temperature, intake air temperature, and battery voltage are displayed on the smartphone.\n･Lap timer (Time)\n　Measure lap times with “Multi-function Button” on the left handlebar. After, check the data recorded by the machine's CCU on your smartphone. Since lap-by-lap measurement is available, you can numerically check the settings effect and lap time discrepancies in actual races.\n･Set Up\n　A FAQ-style setup guide is available for engine and suspension settings. Since it is easy to check the setting instructions on your smartphone, anyone can easily setup the engine and suspension. \n\n■ Supported environment OS: iOS11 or higher\n･This app requires a smartphone.\n･It is not guaranteed that the app will work with all devices.\n\n■ Precautions:\n･Use this app safely in compliance with all traffic rules and regulations.\n･Only use it when the machine is parked in a safe place.\n･It is not guaranteed that this app will work with all machines. CCU installation location and installation method may affect accuracy, sensitivity, and operation of the CCU.\n･Some functions of this app require an internet connection through mobile data communication or wireless LAN.\n･It is not guaranteed that the figures displayed on this app are accurate.\n\n■ Inquiries\n･This app can be used with some Yamaha machines. For inquiries, contact Yamaha dealer."

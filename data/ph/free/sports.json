The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

      "label": "The Free Shot Timer is an extremely accurate shot timer application that anyone can use to improve their shooting skills.\n     When designing the Free Shot Timer we asked shooters of all types and experience levels what they wanted in a timer. We found that the most important features in a shot timer from the shooter’s perspective are ACCURACY and EASE OF OPERATION. The last thing people want to do at the range is mess around with their timer, but at the same time they want it to work.\n     With that in mind we engineered a shot timer app that has the precision of a high dollar stand-alone unit, with an incredibly user-friendly interface. But we didn’t stop there…\n\n\nOther Features:\n\nAdjustable Start Delay (0-4 seconds).\n\nRandom Start Delay (randomly starts the timer 2-5 seconds after the start button is pressed).\n\nAdjustable Par Time (0-99.99 seconds). \n\nExtra Loud Start Beep, designed to be heard through ear protection.\n\nLarge, easy to read numerical display.\n\nSave shot data to view later.\n\nEmail shot data.\n\nPrint shot data right from your device using AirPrint."

Like many golfers, we have been waiting for this app for a long time. We are finally fed up with waiting and decide to develop it ourselves. \n\nThis app uses your Apple Watch's accelerometer/gyroscope to measure your tempo. You can compete with others on the longest streak of golf swings with a perfect tempo. The app also offer statistics on percentage of slow, fast, or perfect tempo swings, so you know what to work on. An ideal tempo has 3:1 ratio, meaning your back swing should be 3 times as long as your down swing. \n\nIf you want to measure your swing tempos (and more) in real games, you can also use our golf GPS + Scorecard app which tracks your swing on the golf course, in addition to telling you GPS distances to 35,000+ golf courses and track your shots automatically.\n\nThis is designed for Watch OS3, with a much more robust swing detection algorithm. No more limitations on swing detection like in version 1.x. \n\nNote: If no swing is detected for any reason, right after the swing, you may be prompted to log the trace. Click log, then email us support@vimo.co with the time of logging, and we will take a look.\n\n** Watch OS3 is required for this app. If it is not showing on your watch, go to Apple Watch app on Phone, choose \"General->Software Update\" and follow instructions. **\n\nThis app integrates with Apple HealthKit. It records your golf practice session as a golf workout."

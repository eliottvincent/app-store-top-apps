From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

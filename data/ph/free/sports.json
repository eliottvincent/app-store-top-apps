From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

It’s the personal basketball trainer that’s always with you, capturing your performance, your stats, and your progress—guiding you to the next level. With HomeCourt, every rep counts. \n\nTRAIN SMARTER\nHomeCourt captures your moves and your stats as you train—so you can see your true skill level. HomeCourt uses the camera on your device to track your performance in real-time, everything from your jump shot to your crossover. In-depth data and analytics help you break down every session. HomeCourt calculates metrics like shooting percentage, accuracy, release time, dribble speed, vertical jump and more. You can even use Apple Watch to track your heart rate and save your data to HealthKit. \n\nENGAGE IN FUN, INTERACTIVE DRILLS\nUsing HomeCourt is less like training and more like a video game. The immersive live-action experience is powered by AR (augmented reality), with virtual targets, audio cues, bonus levels, points and badges—it’s like you’re inside the game.

You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad. No special basketballs, uncomfortable sensors, or expensive equipment is required. Just set up your phone with a clear view of the court and starting training and competing through HomeCourt.\n\nPRICING\n• Free: Access the full library of 100+ drills and activities. Get unlimited shot tracking.\n• HomeCourt Plus: Access your full workout history, get complete skill ratings, join the members-only training club, request feedback from HomeCourt pro trainers, participate in HomeCourt Global Camp, and create up to 4 user profiles.\n\nHomeCourt Plus is available for subscription as either monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions. Payment will be charged to your App Store account upon the expiration of the free trial period. Subscription automatically renews unless the subscription is canceled or auto-renew turned off at least 24 hours before the expiration of the free trial period or the current subscription period. Subscription may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to App Store account settings after purchase.

      "label": "Now updated for iOS 7 and 64-bit support!\n\nBasketball WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase basketball coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. \n\nSimply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the court!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the court you'd like (or leave it at a full-court display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the ice at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default \"position\" letters OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Originally released for the iPhone in the summer of 2009, it is one of the original applications of its kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  \nVisit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Basketball WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.\n\nNeed to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. \n\nWant to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the \"trailing lines\" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player \"came from\" before that player reached their current position. \n\nConfiguring Basketball WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the court (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the court (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the court, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. \n\nBasketball WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.\n\nBasketball WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the court? Use Basketball WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

We found that the most important features in a shot timer from the shooter’s perspective are ACCURACY and EASE OF OPERATION. The last thing people want to do at the range is mess around with their timer, but at the same time they want it to work.\n     With that in mind we engineered a shot timer app that has the precision of a high dollar stand-alone unit, with an incredibly user-friendly interface. But we didn’t stop there…\n\n\nOther Features:\n\nAdjustable Start Delay (0-4 seconds).\n\nRandom Start Delay (randomly starts the timer 2-5 seconds after the start button is pressed).\n\nAdjustable Par Time (0-99.99 seconds). \n\nExtra Loud Start Beep, designed to be heard through ear protection.\n\nLarge, easy to read numerical display.\n\nSave shot data to view later.\n\nEmail shot data.\n\nPrint shot data right from your device using AirPrint."

The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

HomeCourt uses the camera on your device to track your performance in real-time, everything from your jump shot to your crossover. In-depth data and analytics help you break down every session. HomeCourt calculates metrics like shooting percentage, accuracy, release time, dribble speed, vertical jump and more. You can even use Apple Watch to track your heart rate and save your data to HealthKit. \n\nENGAGE IN FUN, INTERACTIVE DRILLS\nUsing HomeCourt is less like training and more like a video game. The immersive live-action experience is powered by AR (augmented reality), with virtual targets, audio cues, bonus levels, points and badges—it’s like you’re inside the game. Now practicing skills is engaging, not boring, so you’ll stick to it and improve more. \n\nLEARN FROM THE PROS\nHomeCourt is an official partner of the NBA and provides access to the expertise of the most elite players in the game today. Train with interactive drills and instruction from NBA and WNBA athletes. Learn their moves and even compete against them in interactive challenges. \n\nCOMPETE WITH FRIENDS\nDon’t workout alone, compete virtually with your friends, family, and teammates. You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad. No special basketballs, uncomfortable sensors, or expensive equipment is required. Just set up your phone with a clear view of the court and starting training and competing through HomeCourt.\n\nPRICING\n• Free: Access the full library of 100+ drills and activities.

We found that the most important features in a shot timer from the shooter’s perspective are ACCURACY and EASE OF OPERATION. The last thing people want to do at the range is mess around with their timer, but at the same time they want it to work.\n     With that in mind we engineered a shot timer app that has the precision of a high dollar stand-alone unit, with an incredibly user-friendly interface. But we didn’t stop there…\n\n\nOther Features:\n\nAdjustable Start Delay (0-4 seconds).\n\nRandom Start Delay (randomly starts the timer 2-5 seconds after the start button is pressed).\n\nAdjustable Par Time (0-99.99 seconds). \n\nExtra Loud Start Beep, designed to be heard through ear protection.\n\nLarge, easy to read numerical display.\n\nSave shot data to view later.\n\nEmail shot data.\n\nPrint shot data right from your device using AirPrint."

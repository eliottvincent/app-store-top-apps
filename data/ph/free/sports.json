From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

      "label": "The Free Shot Timer is an extremely accurate shot timer application that anyone can use to improve their shooting skills.\n     When designing the Free Shot Timer we asked shooters of all types and experience levels what they wanted in a timer. We found that the most important features in a shot timer from the shooter’s perspective are ACCURACY and EASE OF OPERATION. The last thing people want to do at the range is mess around with their timer, but at the same time they want it to work.\n     With that in mind we engineered a shot timer app that has the precision of a high dollar stand-alone unit, with an incredibly user-friendly interface. But we didn’t stop there…\n\n\nOther Features:\n\nAdjustable Start Delay (0-4 seconds).\n\nRandom Start Delay (randomly starts the timer 2-5 seconds after the start button is pressed).\n\nAdjustable Par Time (0-99.99 seconds). \n\nExtra Loud Start Beep, designed to be heard through ear protection.\n\nLarge, easy to read numerical display.\n\nSave shot data to view later.\n\nEmail shot data.\n\nPrint shot data right from your device using AirPrint."

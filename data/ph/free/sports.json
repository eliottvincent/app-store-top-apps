It’s the personal basketball trainer that’s always with you, capturing your performance, your stats, and your progress—guiding you to the next level. With HomeCourt, every rep counts. \n\nTRAIN SMARTER\nHomeCourt captures your moves and your stats as you train—so you can see your true skill level. HomeCourt uses the camera on your device to track your performance in real-time, everything from your jump shot to your crossover. In-depth data and analytics help you break down every session. HomeCourt calculates metrics like shooting percentage, accuracy, release time, dribble speed, vertical jump and more. You can even use Apple Watch to track your heart rate and save your data to HealthKit. \n\nENGAGE IN FUN, INTERACTIVE DRILLS\nUsing HomeCourt is less like training and more like a video game. The immersive live-action experience is powered by AR (augmented reality), with virtual targets, audio cues, bonus levels, points and badges—it’s like you’re inside the game. Now practicing skills is engaging, not boring, so you’ll stick to it and improve more. \n\nLEARN FROM THE PROS\nHomeCourt is an official partner of the NBA and provides access to the expertise of the most elite players in the game today. Train with interactive drills and instruction from NBA and WNBA athletes. Learn their moves and even compete against them in interactive challenges. \n\nCOMPETE WITH FRIENDS\nDon’t workout alone, compete virtually with your friends, family, and teammates. You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad. No special basketballs, uncomfortable sensors, or expensive equipment is required. Just set up your phone with a clear view of the court and starting training and competing through HomeCourt.\n\nPRICING\n• Free: Access the full library of 100+ drills and activities. Get unlimited shot tracking.\n• HomeCourt Plus: Access your full workout history, get complete skill ratings, join the members-only training club, request feedback from HomeCourt pro trainers, participate in HomeCourt Global Camp, and create up to 4 user profiles.\n\nHomeCourt Plus is available for subscription as either monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions.

When the strings wear out, the precision and the touch of the racket get lost – just as a racing car’s wheels start spinning when its tires are worn out.\n\nPlaying your badminton racket with fresh strings has many advantages:\n\n - higher repulsion power for longer clears and faster smashes\n - better feel for the ball and more controled hits\n - better shock-damping performance for joint-protection at arm and shoulder"

The last thing people want to do at the range is mess around with their timer, but at the same time they want it to work.\n     With that in mind we engineered a shot timer app that has the precision of a high dollar stand-alone unit, with an incredibly user-friendly interface. But we didn’t stop there…\n\n\nOther Features:\n\nAdjustable Start Delay (0-4 seconds).\n\nRandom Start Delay (randomly starts the timer 2-5 seconds after the start button is pressed).\n\nAdjustable Par Time (0-99.99 seconds). \n\nExtra Loud Start Beep, designed to be heard through ear protection.\n\nLarge, easy to read numerical display.\n\nSave shot data to view later.\n\nEmail shot data.\n\nPrint shot data right from your device using AirPrint."

Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

Do you need to add some structure to your practice time?  Would you like advice and guidance from an expert who has played the game at the highest level?  Then Simon Webb's Pool Workout is for you!\n \nFeaturing 35 pro practice exercises the app shows you exactly what you need to do to improve your game.  Each exercise includes a detailed explanation with an animated demonstration.  You can play through the exercise yourself and record your score in the app.  Over time the app will track your progress so you can see how you are improving and where you need to practice more. \n \nEach exercise focuses on a specific skill - potting, breaking, doubles, cueball control, skill shots, patterns and pace control.  This means you can work on all aspects of your skillset to build a winning game.  Exercises are graded by difficulty to keep you challenged as your skills improve.  There are also links to Simon's YouTube channel with in-depth explanations and demonstrations of some of the exercises.\n \nThe app helps you structure your practice time by grouping exercises into workouts.  The app comes with four pre-configured workouts that have been exclusively created by Simon to help you develop the full set of skills you need to win.  The app tracks your workout performance over time so that you can see how your overall game is improving. \n \nThe app also includes a workout builder to let you build your workouts from the exercises in the app.  This means you can tailor your practice routine precisely to match your skill level.\n \nSimon Webb's Pool Workout is the perfect app if you are serious about improving your pool game and winning more matches.  It has all the tools you need to practice effectively and turn yourself into a better pool player.\n \n35 exercises covering a wide range of skills\nWorkouts to structure your practice time\nStats tracking to monitor your progress\nAnimated demonstrations and videos to aid understanding\n \nSimon Webb is a former professional pool player and England international. He recently retired from playing to focus on a commentating and broadcasting career.  He has a YouTube Channel where he shares lessons learned during his playing career, coaching tips, practice routines and drills, as well as some insights into my broadcasting career.\n \nSimon says \"I have decided to create this app to further help people improve their pool games. This app will give you some great practice routines and bring a structure to your practice sessions, as well as giving you the vital feedback to allow you to focus on the areas of your game that really need it.\"\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nThe Pool Workout app offers a subset of exercises and workouts for free - you can access and use these exercises by downloading and installing the app.  To access all of the exercises and workouts, the Pool Workout app offers a monthly auto-renewing subscription plan that costs £1.99 per month.\n\nThe subscription is auto-renewable which means it will automatically renew unless you turn auto-renew off in your App Store account settings on your device.

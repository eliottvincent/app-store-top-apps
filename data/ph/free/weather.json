It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

Lives have been lost due to storm flooding because people didn’t know what path to take to safety or even if their area would be hit by a flood-causing downpour.\n\nArko hopes to address the need of every Filipino to more information during times of major rains and flooding. By accessing the extensive databases of Project NOAH and DOST, Arko can give the user up-to-the-minute updates on rainfall and other weather conditions near you or wherever you choose.\n\nFeatures\n\n•Flood Mapping: Using data from previous floods (like Ondoy), Arko will show you which areas are prone to flooding so you can avoid them, or designate a safe zone where evacuees can go to during floods.\n•Remote Monitoring: Arko can allow you to check on how flooding and/or rainfall is in other areas. Perfect for those who worry if a family member, loved one or friend is doing fine despite the weather. \n•Weather Advisory: By connecting with Project NOAH, PAGASA and DOST's various weather monitoring facilities, Arko can give you updates on the weather. It can even give you a good estimate on whether it will rain or not, based on the data it gets.\n \nDev Team\n\nArko was developed by the Mobile Team of Pointwest Technologies Corporation, in cooperation with Project NOAH and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) of the Republic of the Philippines."

You can also get alert services for the solar wind data, Kp index, and hemispheric power. These extra services can be purchased within the app.\n\nThe app also provides predicted and observed Kp index, solar wind data directly from DSCOVR, such as solar wind speed and magnetic field (Bz and Bt), and graphs with recent data to help you predict auroral activity as well as the hemispheric power for the last 6 hours.\n\nThe app focuses much on the activity right now, but we also added a 3 day Kp forecast which can give you a hint which days you could expect higher activity.

The times are precisely calculated for your location and displayed alongside the cloud forecasts so it has never been easier to observe. It is our favourite feature :-) \n\nAlso includes regular weather data (wind, rain, frost, temperature, dew point, etc) so perfect for those wanting a detailed weather forecast, without cutesy graphics. \n\nWe have had a lot of fun building and testing Clear Outside and are keen to to develop it further so if you find it useful or have suggestions, please let us know."

      "label": "Singapore weather need not be complicated.\n\nEnvironment aims to bring you uncomplicated weather info, not just on your iPhone, or on your home screen, but also on your wrist - on the Apple Watch, and now, even on your TV, via an Apple TV. \n\nOne should not have to scan through the entire app to find the weather condition reading, such as the Pollutant Standard Index (PSI), or even just the next weather forecast. \n\nThis is why Environment is designed to be simple and pleasing to use. Everything is clearly displayed and colour coded if suitable, for your ease-of-use.\n\nNOTE: Environment is designed for Singapore use only. For users living outside Singapore, but wish to see Singapore's weather, feel free to have a look around!\n\n◆ WIDGETS ◆\nView the latest PM2.5, PSI, UV index, temperature or humidity with weather forecasts, directly on your Home Screen. Each widget can be set to display a weather condition reading such as the temperature, of a specific place, which you had added in the app.\nThis should bring even more convenience rather than to need to open the app each time.\n\n◆ RAIN MAP ◆\nAll weather aficionados will know that, even if forecasts are as accurate as can be, nothing beats the ever-changing rain weather map, that showcases the intensity of a rain, at a specific region. While most apps in the market only support this feature on the iPhone, Environment brings it to your Watch for your convenience.\n\nYou can view up to 2 hours of rain map data on the watch by spinning the Digital Crown, or up to 4 hours of rain map data on your phone.\n\nView it either for Singapore or nearby countries such as Malaysia or Indonesia using the new 240km range feature.\n\nFurthermore, you can add mini rain maps on your Home Screen with the Rain Map Mini widget. Select a location to get a zoomed in focused map that shows only the rain condition that matters to you, or show rain condition for the entire Singapore. You can also customise whether to show a pin on your selected location, the colour of the pin, and other details.\n\n◆ AIR QUALITY AND UV INDEX ◆\nView the past 24 hours of PSI, PM2.5 and UV indexes, presented to you on a bar chart.\n\n◆ VISUALS ◆\nThe visuals of the app are designed to be simple, yet colourful enough for one to quickly glance at an element so as to get the information they want.\n\n◆ FULLY FEATURED WATCH APP ◆\nNot only can you view the rain map on the watch, you can also view Singapore’s average, and the temperature, humidity, PSI, UV, PM2.5 indexes of your current location or locations you’ve added on your phone, all, right in your watch.\n\n◆ MULTI-LOCATIONS ◆\nUse your current location or add your own locations all around Singapore, to get the closest weather station’s data provided by local agencies for the best accuracy.\n\n◆ LIST VIEW ◆\nEasily compare key weather indicators, including UV, Air Quality, temperature and humidity, as well as current weather situations as provided by local weather stations between multiple locations that you have added. \n\n◆ NO TRACKING ◆\nNobody likes getting looked at, or tracked by anyone. Environment only uses the internet when it needs to, such as calling weather APIs of Singapore, as well as Apple Maps for mapping and location search. That’s it.\n\n◆ NO ADS, TOTALLY FREE ◆\nEnvironment is free for everyone to use. No ads, no frustrations, no limitations.\nYou can, however, buy me a drink in the app, if you wish to show support for the development hours spent on this app!\n\nProudly Made in Singapore.\n\nMy name is Vincent, and I have been making apps locally for quite a while now. I hope this app will bring convenience and enjoyment to you.\n\n◆ DATA SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGEMENT◆\nNOTE: Environment is NOT supported/endorsed or affiliated by any local agencies, official entities or apps such as MyENV, in any way.\n\nEnvironment uses only the local data sources listed below:\n© National Environment Agency (NEA)\n© Data.gov.sg\n© Meteorological Service Singapore (weather.gov.sg)"

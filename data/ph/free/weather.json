Receive precise data with the press of a button from anywhere.\n\nFree Features:\n\n•\tWBGT reading – WBGT reading at your current position. \n•\tCurrent Hyperlocal Weather Data – Numerous current weather data points at the device’s location.\n\nPaid Features:\n\n•\tWBGT Anywhere in the World – Obtain WBGT readings anywhere in the world.\n•\tRegular Temperature Threshold Alerts - Get instant alerts when the WBGT exceeds your threshold. \n•\tSave Your Data in Seconds - Choose to save your readings with the press of a button.\n•\tAutomated Documentation – Carrying paperwork with you is no longer needed.  Export your saved data to your email in seconds.\n•\tHassle Free – No more looking for batteries.  No more calibration.  No more running back to the office for a forgotten device.\n•\tNo Equilibration Needed - Get the valuable details you need in less time. The Zelus app doesn't require equilibration, so you can get temperature readings in mere seconds instead of waiting 15 minutes or more.\n\nStay safe when out in the sun on some of the hottest days by periodically checking the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature in the area. It's as simple as pulling out your phone, opening the app, and allowing its complex mathematical algorithms to do the work for you, providing you with the instant results you want and need.\n\nWhether you're playing football, soccer, basketball, or simply walking around outside, it's crucial to have an accurate WBGT reading. If the temperature is too high based on this reading, you're at risk of suffering from heatstroke and other heat related illnesses that put your life at risk.\n\nUse Zelus to take daily measurements, keep track of data, and skip outdoor practice when it's simply too hot for training and other outdoor activities.\n\nTerms at: https://www.iubenda.com/terms-and-conditions/72489665"

It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "The “MyObservatory” is a highly popular weather app providing personalized weather services. The app provides current weather including temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind direction and speed, as well as weather photograph collected from nearby weather stations at user's location, specified location, or selected weather stations.  Weather photos and rainfall data will be updated at 5-minute and 15-minute intervals respectively.  Other data will be updated in 10-minute interval and the update time will be displayed at the bottom of the front page.\n\nPoints to note:\n1. The notification service of weather warnings, Special Weather Tips, and Location-based Rain Forecast is provided through the Apple Push Notification service (APNs).  The Hong Kong Observatory cannot guarantee the reception of the above notifications by users.  Users should not rely on the mobile app as the only means for reception of important weather information.  Depending on factors such as network usage and quality of user's mobile phone connection, it may take 5 to 20 minutes or even longer for the app to receive the notification after it is issued by the Hong Kong Observatory.\n\n2. Use of Location-based Rain Forecast notification will increase the battery usage and data download slightly.  Users who wish to save battery usage of the app may enable the notification function in rainy days and before outdoor activities, and disable the function in sunny days and after finishing the outdoor activities.  Meanwhile, selecting options of less frequent update and lower position accuracy in the advanced settings of the notification function may also save battery usage.\n\n3. Although the “MyObservatory” is a free app, user will be charged by their mobile network service provider on the use of data service. These charges can become very expensive on roaming. Please ensure that the option of “Data Roaming” have been disabled in the settings of your mobile devices.\n\n4. In the \"My Location Settings\", users can opt for using the automatic location service provided by the smartphone, or designating \"My Location\" on the map themselves.  This location will be displayed on the main page and in \"My Weather Report\". If your location cannot be found, \"My Location\" will show the last location which was successfully found or \"Hong Kong Observatory\". The meteorological data displayed on \"My Location\" or the station you added is provided by meteorological stations nearby, and is not necessarily from a station in the same region. In case meteorological data is not available from nearby stations, data from other meteorological stations at headquarter of the Observatory, King's Park, and Star Ferry will be used instead.  If this is the case, the symbol ▲ will appear to the left of the updated time.\n\n5. The location displayed in the function of \"My Weather Report\" is provided by third party provider.\n\n6. Because of the variation in both the terrian and height of where the weather stations located, and the variation of your location estimated by the mobile phone, users be noted that there would be difference between the actual situation and the weather information shown on \"MyObservatory.\"\n\n7. The clock on the main page of the app is displayed with HKT synchronizing automatically to the Observatory's Internet Time Server, and may not be the same as the time displayed on the smartphone.\n\n8. The app provides link for users to browse the Observatory's Facebook Page.  Users may choose to log in his/her own Facebook account.  More features of Facebook can be used after logging in.  Please be reminded to pay attention to the notes of the Facebook Page, and the privacy policies of the Facebook platform."

      "label": "This app uses the barometric pressure sensor built into all the newer iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch Models sold after 2016 with few exceptions. You need one of these newer devices to use this App. See below which older iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch without this sensor are not supported!\n\nThis App features a Barometer for weather, an Altimeter for outdoor activities, a barometric Trend and a Notification Center Widget.\n\nEven without the optional In-App-Purchase this is a fully functional Barometer with absolutely no draw-backs and all important features accessible. Always without ads! (See \"Pro Features\" at the end). No internet connection required, no data transmitted - runs on your device only!\n\nKeep an eye on the barometric pressure and be your own weather forecast! This little app uses only GPS (optional) and the new barometric pressure sensor to calculate the barometric pressure used in weather forecasts. The new iPhones have a barometric pressure sensor built in so this app works completely without internet. The handy marker helps you keep track of changes in the barometric pressure and let's you predict weather changes! Please realize, that a single barometric pressure reading is not enough to tell the current weather situation but the barometric pressure and its change over time is a very good indicator for weather changes!\n\nNow you can also see the trend in barometric pressure with graph charts displaying the measurements taken during the last 30 days! (6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d)\n\nThe Altimeter helps you track your altitude changes based on the change of pressure. Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for checking how high up the mountain you have climbed (works for other activities too). The App does not use GPS for the Altimeter.\n\nPlease Note that on older devices such as the 4S, 5, 5S and 5C as well as on any iPod Touch and iPad Models older than iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4 as well as the Apple Watch 1 and 2, this app will not be able to read barometric pressure values and not display any useful information. The first generation 4-inch iPhone SE is not supported - the new SE (2020) is!\n\nAll basic features, the Barometer, the Altimeter, the Trend and the Widget are completely free to use for everyone and are fully functional at maximum accuracy available. No ads!\nThe only features with restricted access via In-App-Purchase are listed at the end under \"Pro Features\". Those are nice to have features for power users or those that want to show their support for the App!\n\nFeatures (free for everyone)\n- Barometer for weather\n- Altimeter for outdoor activities\n- HomeScreen Widget (iOS 14 and newer)\n- Today-View Widget (all Versions)\n- Watch App\n- Up to 30d trend visualised with graphs\n- Interactive timeline on the trend graphs\n- No internet connection required since the sensor is built into the new iPhones and iPads\n- Supports 6 different pressure units\n- Support for 2 different altitude units\n- Analog Barometer with support for all 6 units\n- Configurable \"displayed accuracy\" / number of decimals\n- Supports setting a custom marker so you can track changes in barometric pressure\n- Manual altitude setting or automatic altitude updates based on GPS for the Barometer.\n- GPS Correction. In case your GPS seems to always be 'off' a little you can now fix this easily.\n- Portrait and Landscape support\n- No ads! No data collection beyond your device (history and settings). No web communication at all.\n\nPro Features (one time In-App Purchase required)\n- Change the Barometer Face\n- Fishing Barometer\n- Two scales on the Barometer\n- Data export in CSV Format"

The app is intended to support a wide range of maritime activities, from recreational fishing and sailing to the operation of professional transport vessels. The source for the surface current data is a numerical model operated by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The model assimilates oceanographic high-frequency radar (HFR) measurements from the Central & Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) HFR Network, along with other observations such as tides and wind. The resulting dataset contains current vector fields for hourly timestamps ranging from the recent past, to the present and up to 48 hours into the future. The complete vector dataset is downloaded by the app to allow autonomous offline operation.\n\nThis app contains experimental data and is NOT for navigational purposes."

Devices with built-in sensors will get values from it and for those without sensors, the pressure value is reported by the nearest weather station.\n\nWith our clean and intuitive app, you can see the  current pressure with just one look. You can save any current value to compare pressure from other days. What's coolest is that you can swipe through multiple units and instantly see the pressure in the value you are interested in, including:\n- pounds per square inch\n- millibar\n- hectopascal\n- kilopascal\n- millimeter of mercury\n- bar\n- inch of mercury\n\nYou can also change preferred units in settings.\n\nWith one screen swipe, you can see an altimeter gauge with current values, our precise altitude calculation algorithms (which involve GPS, network services and calibrated pressure sensors) we deliver you the most accurate elevation info as possible, in barometric units or if you prefer, you can swipe over to metric and imperial units.\n\nThe third screen of the application has clear, accurate weather info, which includes:\n- temperature\n- wind speed\n- wind direction\n- humidity\n- cloudiness\n- dew point temperature\n- fog\n\nDevices with pressure sensors now have the possibility to switch from average elevation reported on the Altimeter screen to barometer-based elevation only You are also now able to calibrate with your own mean sea level pressure value.\n\nThe history screen has been redesigned and you can now choose from four different values - MSL pressure, ground level pressure, temperature and elevation. You can also now easily filter data according to any time span you want.\n\nA brand-new functionality of custom notifications has also been added. You can now add time-based notifications: just setup the time and days on which you want to receive notifications with current pressure values and voila. You can also set a pressure level alarm, above or below which the device will warn you. What’s even more, you can receive notifications after pressure changes by the value you set.\n\nAn autosave function is now available. You can set a time interval at which your device will automatically save pressure, temperature and elevation values to give you up to the minute information about weather changes.\n\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/barometer\r\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/barometer"

The times are precisely calculated for your location and displayed alongside the cloud forecasts so it has never been easier to observe. It is our favourite feature :-) \n\nAlso includes regular weather data (wind, rain, frost, temperature, dew point, etc) so perfect for those wanting a detailed weather forecast, without cutesy graphics. \n\nWe have had a lot of fun building and testing Clear Outside and are keen to to develop it further so if you find it useful or have suggestions, please let us know."

      "label": "Alti-Barometer Pro is in a class by itself. This breakthrough app rewrites the rules for mobile barometers and altimeters with a combination of exclusive capabilities.\n\nFirst and foremost, Alti-Barometer Pro automatically and continuously analyses and logs readings from your device's pressure sensor in the background with no intervention required - even when your phone is locked and in standby. Because it's a real data-logging barometer, Alti-Barometer Pro shows you barometric pressure trends over time, and pressure trends are what tell you which way the weather may be headed.\n\nUsing the app’s proprietary BaroTrak algorithms, Alti-Barometer Pro also automatically compensates barometer readings for even small changes in altitude, and automatically compensates the altimeter for weather-related air pressure changes. The app's BaroTrak processing is an exclusive, class-defining innovation that makes a fully capable mobile barometer like ours possible.\n\nAnother exclusive feature is Storm Alarm which can notify you of large changes in barometric pressure over a defined time period.\n\nAlti-Barometer Pro logs barometric pressure and altitude data every 15 seconds to achieve incredible resolution and accuracy. This is on par with professional-grade weather instruments, and ensures that you can track both weather and altitude over time with very high precision. \n\nThese and other innovations set a new bar for mobile barometer and altimeter performance and capability, and Alti-Barometer Pro does all this while keeping power consumption to a minimum with very little use of power-hungry GPS.\n\nThe ability to continuously capture and process high-quality pressure data is just one part of the Alti-Barometer Pro story. The app’s advanced visualization capabilities let you see and explore your altitude and barometric pressure data using beautiful, fully-interactive graphics on your iPhone or Watch. And with the optional subscription upgrade, you can automatically save and view daily snapshots of your altimeter and barometer logs so you can go back and look at that epic storm or impressive climb.\n\nAlti-Barometer Pro also turns any iPhone into a cloud-connected barometric weather station. With its unique BaroMap feature, Alti-Barometer Pro lets you automatically and anonymously upload your barometric pressure data to Apple’s secure iCloud, and view barometric trends and pressure information across the app's user community on a fully interactive global map.\n\nAnd Alti-Barometer Pro’s \"Share\" feature allows you to easily share interesting barometer or altimeter graphs through social media, messages, or email.\n\nAlti-Barometer Pro supports all Watch complication styles and iOS widgets to keep you up to date with altitude and barometric pressure trends at a glance. The app's Watch complications and widgets are fully live, which means that you see current data and trends without having to manually refresh the app - another unique capability that sets Alti-Barometer Pro apart.\n\nAs an optional upgrade feature, the app also provides full CSV-compatible data export and import so you can save a detailed record of a hike, climb, or that big storm and analyze or view it later at full precision. And outdoor enthusiasts will appreciate the app’s climb and descent logs as well as real-time vertical speed and altitude trend reporting.\n\nWe originally developed Alti-Barometer Pro because we missed the altitude/barometer functionality of our dedicated ABC (altimeter/barometer/compass) watches. We couldn’t find an app that even came close, and we decided to create something much, much better.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.bogbridges.com/altibarometerproprivacy\nTerms of use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Simple and beautiful rustic style Thermometer now in your iPhone or iPad.\n\nWhat people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:\n\n- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "The “MyObservatory” is a highly popular weather app providing personalized weather services. The app provides current weather including temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind direction and speed, as well as weather photograph collected from nearby weather stations at user's location, specified location, or selected weather stations.  Weather photos and rainfall data will be updated at 5-minute and 15-minute intervals respectively.  Other data will be updated in 10-minute interval and the update time will be displayed at the bottom of the front page.\n\nPoints to note:\n1. The notification service of weather warnings, Special Weather Tips, and Location-based Rain Forecast is provided through the Apple Push Notification service (APNs).  The Hong Kong Observatory cannot guarantee the reception of the above notifications by users.  Users should not rely on the mobile app as the only means for reception of important weather information.  Depending on factors such as network usage and quality of user's mobile phone connection, it may take 5 to 20 minutes or even longer for the app to receive the notification after it is issued by the Hong Kong Observatory.\n\n2. Use of Location-based Rain Forecast notification will increase the battery usage and data download slightly.  Users who wish to save battery usage of the app may enable the notification function in rainy days and before outdoor activities, and disable the function in sunny days and after finishing the outdoor activities.  Meanwhile, selecting options of less frequent update and lower position accuracy in the advanced settings of the notification function may also save battery usage.\n\n3. Although the “MyObservatory” is a free app, user will be charged by their mobile network service provider on the use of data service. These charges can become very expensive on roaming. Please ensure that the option of “Data Roaming” have been disabled in the settings of your mobile devices.\n\n4. In the \"My Location Settings\", users can opt for using the automatic location service provided by the smartphone, or designating \"My Location\" on the map themselves.  This location will be displayed on the main page and in \"My Weather Report\". If your location cannot be found, \"My Location\" will show the last location which was successfully found or \"Hong Kong Observatory\". The meteorological data displayed on \"My Location\" or the station you added is provided by meteorological stations nearby, and is not necessarily from a station in the same region. In case meteorological data is not available from nearby stations, data from other meteorological stations at headquarter of the Observatory, King's Park, and Star Ferry will be used instead.  If this is the case, the symbol ▲ will appear to the left of the updated time.\n\n5. The location displayed in the function of \"My Weather Report\" is provided by third party provider.\n\n6. Because of the variation in both the terrian and height of where the weather stations located, and the variation of your location estimated by the mobile phone, users be noted that there would be difference between the actual situation and the weather information shown on \"MyObservatory.\"\n\n7. The clock on the main page of the app is displayed with HKT synchronizing automatically to the Observatory's Internet Time Server, and may not be the same as the time displayed on the smartphone.\n\n8. The app provides link for users to browse the Observatory's Facebook Page.  Users may choose to log in his/her own Facebook account.  More features of Facebook can be used after logging in.  Please be reminded to pay attention to the notes of the Facebook Page, and the privacy policies of the Facebook platform."

      "label": "*30 Days Free Trial on initial download!*  \n\nPlan. File. Fly. Log.\n\nGarmin Pilot is the most comprehensive suite of tools for the iPad designed specifically for general aviation and corporate pilots. Flight planning, charts, interactive maps, weather briefing resources and navigation capabilities; it’s all included. The app’s intuitive interface mirrors those on the newest Garmin touchscreen avionics so you can go seamlessly from preflight to inflight.  \n\nPlan \n\nGarmin Pilot’s powerful capabilities start with pre-flight planning, providing pilots with the most comprehensive aviation weather information to make better-informed flight decisions. Pilots can check NEXRAD radar, visible and infrared cloud imagery, METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, NOTAMs, winds and temperature aloft, TFRs and lightning data. With Garmin Pilot, data can be displayed over Garmin’s interactive maps that support track-up navigation, VFR sectional or an IFR low or high en-route chart to visualize the weather for your route. Add text-based weather widgets and use the exclusive NavTrack feature to view weather along the planned route. \n\nFile \n\nWith Garmin Pilot, users can easily enter a flight plan and interactively edit it on the map. Pre-loaded forms make it quick to save and reuse data for frequently flown routes. And when the flight plan is ready, Garmin Pilot makes it simple to file, amend or close the flight plan via Leidos Flight Service or DUATS.  \n\nFly \n\nGarmin Pilot provides full en-route navigation capability on its moving map.

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

If you prefer an even more detailed image of your city or town you can press the magnifying glass icon to zoom in.\n\nThe Buienradar app is suitable for iPhone and iPad. Via the handy widgets (with rain graph for your current location) you can quickly see on your today's screen whether it will rain soon without opening the app. The widget is now also visible with 3D touch: press the Buienradar app icon a little harder in your app overview to make the widget appear.\n\nBesides the Buienradar you can also find other radars and maps:\n- Drizzle\n- Sun \n- NL Satellite images\n- Storm\n- Pollen (hay fever)\n- Sun (UV)\n- Mosquitos\n- BBQ\n- Temperature\n- Feeling temperature\n- Wind\n- Fog\n- Snow\n- EU Buienradar (rain radar)\n- EU Satellite images\n\nYou can find personalized weather info in the table “Komende uren in” (Next 8 hours weather prediction) for your favorite location (even abroad!) like hour-to-hour predictions for: temperature, feeling temperature, the number of millimeters of rain per hour, the chance of rain and wind force (in Beaufort).\n\nBesides thunderstorm, snow, sun, wind and temperature maps we also offer wind chill, ground temperature, sun intensity, air pressure, gusts, visibility and humidity data, together with the exact times of sunrise and sunset for your location.\n\nWe also offer seasonal radar maps. In the summer, for example, you can use our pollen and mosquito radars in order to receive a timely notification when it is wise to hang up your mosquito net. In the winter you can use our snowradar, which informs you about winter precipitation, but we also offer a map especially for ground temperature which warns you about night frost.\n\nIn the “14-daagse” tab (14 day forecast) you will find the weather forecast (in a graph) for the next 14 days. You can also see a detailed list view when you click on the tab “Lijst”. This list offers an hourly forecast for the next 7 days and a daily average for the second week.\n\nIn the “Meldingen” tab you can create your own rain alert (free push notification) customized to your daily time schedule and favorite locations so you will never be unprepared for rain or a storm.\n\nIf you don't want to see ads, we also offer the Buienradar Plus plan for €3,49 per year. You can find this easily in “Instellingen” (“Settings”) and then press “Neem Buienradar Plus” (Get Buienradar Plus).\n\nOur Terms of Use can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/gebruikers-voorwaarden.html\n\nOur Privacy statement can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/privacy-statement.html\n\nWe are continuously improving the Buienradar app. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve or if you have any questions, you can always reach out to us by using the feedback form in the app or by sending us an e-mail via appsupport@buienradar.nl. Thanks!"

You can also get alert services for the solar wind data, Kp index, and hemispheric power. These extra services can be purchased within the app.\n\nThe app also provides predicted and observed Kp index, solar wind data directly from DSCOVR, such as solar wind speed and magnetic field (Bz and Bt), and graphs with recent data to help you predict auroral activity as well as the hemispheric power for the last 6 hours.\n\nThe app focuses much on the activity right now, but we also added a 3 day Kp forecast which can give you a hint which days you could expect higher activity.

No fuss, no configuration, just quick weather readouts.\n \nWind Compass Features::\n•  Select Wind Speed reading by switching between Miles/hour or Kilometers/hour or Knots or Beaufort Wind Force or Meters Per Second\n• Select Compass Magnetic Declination from True North or Magnetic North\n• Select Temperature measurement from Fahrenheit or Celsius\n• Select the Arrow direction of the Wind Indicator from Blowing To or Coming From\n \nWeather Forecast Features:\n• Current Temperature as well as the Estimated Highs and Lows for that day\n• Sunrise/Sunset times as well as the \"First Light\" and \"Last light\" times for that day (Also known as Nautical Twilight Start and End)\n• 24 Hour Forecast as well as 7 Day Forecast showing: Time, Estimated Temperature, Estimated Wind Speed and Direction and % Chance of precipitation\n \nCustom Background Settings\nYou can also change the look of the app by selecting from the many different background types including standard colored backgrounds, as well as backgrounds like a map showing your current location, an overlay showing what your rear camera sees, and even a color gradient that auto adjusts from warm to cool based on the temperature of where you are!\n \nWind Compass uses the Forecast.io Weather data to provide accurate conditions where you are. Just open the app, let it update, and there you go. Forecast.io uses many sources and creates as accurate of a forecast as possible for your location.\n \nAs an added bonus, Wind Compass shows you which way is North so if you are inside or turned around, you can always know which way is north, along with the current wind direction.\n \nIf you have any issues with Wind Compass please email contact@maplemedia.io to quickly get the issue resolved. You can also submit a feature request or bug report right from inside the settings menu. \n \n*NOTE* Compass functionality within the app requires physical compass functionality built in. iPods can still get direction info but the compass will not update real time.\n \n*NOTE* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n \nCredits\n \nWind Icon designed by Jojo Franklin from J.Franklin Design (http://jfranklin.design).\n \nForecast Information Powered by Dark Sky https://darksky.net/poweredby/\n\nSubscription Terms: https://maplemedia.io/terms-of-service/\n\nSUPPORT: contact@maplemedia.io"

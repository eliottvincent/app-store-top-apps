      "label": "The “MyObservatory” is a highly popular weather app providing personalized weather services. The app provides current weather including temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind direction and speed, as well as weather photograph collected from nearby weather stations at user's location, specified location, or selected weather stations.  Weather photos and rainfall data will be updated at 5-minute and 15-minute intervals respectively.  Other data will be updated in 10-minute interval and the update time will be displayed at the bottom of the front page.\n\nPoints to note:\n1. The notification service of weather warnings, Special Weather Tips, and Location-based Rain Forecast is provided through the Apple Push Notification service (APNs).  The Hong Kong Observatory cannot guarantee the reception of the above notifications by users.  Users should not rely on the mobile app as the only means for reception of important weather information.  Depending on factors such as network usage and quality of user's mobile phone connection, it may take 5 to 20 minutes or even longer for the app to receive the notification after it is issued by the Hong Kong Observatory.\n\n2. Use of Location-based Rain Forecast notification will increase the battery usage and data download slightly.  Users who wish to save battery usage of the app may enable the notification function in rainy days and before outdoor activities, and disable the function in sunny days and after finishing the outdoor activities.  Meanwhile, selecting options of less frequent update and lower position accuracy in the advanced settings of the notification function may also save battery usage.\n\n3. Although the “MyObservatory” is a free app, user will be charged by their mobile network service provider on the use of data service. These charges can become very expensive on roaming. Please ensure that the option of “Data Roaming” have been disabled in the settings of your mobile devices.\n\n4. In the \"My Location Settings\", users can opt for using the automatic location service provided by the smartphone, or designating \"My Location\" on the map themselves.  This location will be displayed on the main page and in \"My Weather Report\". If your location cannot be found, \"My Location\" will show the last location which was successfully found or \"Hong Kong Observatory\". The meteorological data displayed on \"My Location\" or the station you added is provided by meteorological stations nearby, and is not necessarily from a station in the same region. In case meteorological data is not available from nearby stations, data from other meteorological stations at headquarter of the Observatory, King's Park, and Star Ferry will be used instead.  If this is the case, the symbol ▲ will appear to the left of the updated time.\n\n5. The location displayed in the function of \"My Weather Report\" is provided by third party provider.\n\n6. Because of the variation in both the terrian and height of where the weather stations located, and the variation of your location estimated by the mobile phone, users be noted that there would be difference between the actual situation and the weather information shown on \"MyObservatory.\"\n\n7. The clock on the main page of the app is displayed with HKT synchronizing automatically to the Observatory's Internet Time Server, and may not be the same as the time displayed on the smartphone.\n\n8. The app provides link for users to browse the Observatory's Facebook Page.  Users may choose to log in his/her own Facebook account.  More features of Facebook can be used after logging in.  Please be reminded to pay attention to the notes of the Facebook Page, and the privacy policies of the Facebook platform."

You can also setup and quickly switch between many stored favorite stations if you need to. \n\nNo internet access while outdoors? No problem.

      "label": "Simple and beautiful rustic style Thermometer now in your iPhone or iPad.\n\nWhat people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:\n\n- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

Do not use for navigation.\n\nYou can be easily searched tide places from the map.\nMultiple places are clustered according to the zoom size of map. Tap to zoom in and break down into individual places as a map pins.\nTap the map pin to popup the place name. And then tap the popup to show a tide graph.\nBy default, the tide graph for two weeks from two days ago is shown.\nYou can also show the graph by specifying the date from the calendar.\nIn the initial state, the graph is automatically updated according to the date.\n\nThe tide graph can also graphically check astronomical events such as sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, and moon phase.\nIt can also automatically calculate the time when there is a lot of tide movement and check the time suitable for fishing.\nWhen the tide moves a lot, the size of the waves will increase slightly, making it a suitable time for surfing too.\nYou can change the scale in centimeters or feet in \"Settings\" of app.\n\nTide places can be registered with a name as a favorite. Also, the places you have seen once will be saved as history.\nYou can easily access these places from “Favorites & Histories”.\nTo delete a favorite or history, swipe the item to the left from the list.\n\nTide area is divided into the following seven areas.\nYou can select which area to use at the first startup. You can also change the area selection at any time from \"Settings\" of app.\nIf you are not sure which area to select, select all.\n\n- U.S. Upper East Coast (Maine through Virginia)\t\n- U.S. Lower East Coast (North Carolina through Florida Keys)\n- U.S. Gulf Coast (East to West)\n- U.S. West Coast (North to South)\n- Northern sites outside contiguous U.S. (except Japan)\n- Southern sites outside contiguous U.S.\n- Japan and nearby sites\n\nWhen app starting, it reads the tide information of your specified area and sets the map pin, but the one with fewer selected areas will start slightly faster.\nYou can use “Favorites & Histories” even during the map pin setting process.\n\nFor detailed usage instructions, please refer to \"Help & Support\" from \"Settings\" of app."

Données ©SHOM Licence 124/2017.\n\nmarée.info Essentiel - Horaire, hauteur et coefficient de marée\n\n146 ports :\n• France métropolitaine : de Dunkerque à Saint-Jean-de-Luz\n• Belgique : Nieuwpoort, Oostende, Zeebrugge\n• Anglo-Normandes : Alderney, Guernsey, Jersey\n\nL'application marée.info dans sa formule \"Essentiel\" vous propose l'essentiel des prédictions de marée :\n\n• l'horloge des marées pour la marée du moment, \n• la table des pleines et basses mers (selon abonnement)\n• le calendrier des coefficients avec recherche, \n• le menu calendrier avec les coefficients et les phases de la lune \n\nPratique : Le coefficient s'affiche en pastille sur l'icône de l'application pour le dernier port consulté. Des notifications peuvent être activées pour les pleines mers et basses mers lorsque l'application est inactive (voir Réglages). \n\nL'application \"marée.info Essentiel\" est compatible avec le widget \"Aujourd'hui\" de l'application \"marée.info\" qui affiche l'horloge des marées du dernier port consulté dans le centre de notification de votre appareil.\n\nPour plus de fiabilité et sécurité en mer, l'application fonctionne sans internet. Seules l'installation, les mises à jour et la gestion des abonnements nécessitent une connexion 4G ou WIFI. Assurez-vous que tout fonctionne avant de partir en mer.\n\nPour vous proposer le meilleur, marée.info s'appuie sur les données officielles du SHOM, le Service Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine. Ces données sont payantes, la licence est financée par la publicité et les abonnements.\n\nRappel de l'offre :\n\n= Version sans abonnement  (gratuit)\n\nAccès aux prédictions des marées sur 3 jours ainsi qu'au calendrier des coefficients.\n\n= Abonnement 12 mois (achats intégrés)\n\nAccès complet aux dates des marées disponibles (à ce jour 2020/2021)\nL'abonnement est lié à votre compte Apple/iTunes\n\nFONCTIONS :\n\n- Le sélecteur de port : \nIl permet de passer d'un port à l'autre et de gérer vos favoris. Une horloge sur chaque port permet un rapide coup d'oeil sur l'état de la marée. \n\n- L'horloge des marées : \nL'horloge vous donne l'état de la marée à l'instant T pour le port sélectionné. L'aiguille tourne dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre. Lorsque l'aiguille est à droite du cadran, la mer descend de Pleine Mer à Basse Mer puis l'aiguille passe à gauche du cadran pour la marée montante (de basse mer à pleine mer). Le coefficient est indiqué dans le petite fenêtre de l'horloge. \n\n- le \"Bloc-note\" à coté de l'horloge a plusieurs pages :\n=> Pleine et Basse Mer du moment avec heures et hauteurs  \n=> Mini graphique de la marée montante ou descendante avec hauteur précise (à la différence d'une approximation sinusoidale)\n=> Durée, Marnage et 12èmes\n\n- La table des marées :\n Prédictions par date : heures, hauteurs et coefficients\n Le menu calendrier permet d'accèder à une date précise mais vous pouvez aussi faire défiler toutes les dates consultables (accès selon votre abonnement).\n\n- Le calendrier : \nCoefficients, fêtes, jours fériés. La \"loupe\" active la recherche par critères. Ex: les grandes marées (coef >=100) pour samedi et dimanche.\n\nN'hésitez pas à me contacter par Facebook, Twitter ou mail\nGuillaume - http://maree.info\n\nAVERTISSEMENT : \nEn utilisant cette application vous vous engagez à lire et à accepter les conditions générales d'utilisations (CGU) et avertissements.

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

      "label": "Trying to avoid walking straight into a rainstorm when you go out? Check our rain radar and rain graph before you leave so you never have to get drenched!\n\t\nDe Buienradar app starts with the 3 hour or the 24 hour rain radar forecast. The rain radar image will show you whether it is going to rain in the next upcoming hours or even the next day. Below the radar is the rain graph. In this graph you can see exactly when it is going to rain and how much rainfall is predicted (in millimeters). If you prefer an even more detailed image of your city or town you can press the magnifying glass icon to zoom in.\n\nThe Buienradar app is suitable for iPhone and iPad. Via the handy widgets (with rain graph for your current location) you can quickly see on your today's screen whether it will rain soon without opening the app. The widget is now also visible with 3D touch: press the Buienradar app icon a little harder in your app overview to make the widget appear.\n\nBesides the Buienradar you can also find other radars and maps:\n- Drizzle\n- Sun \n- NL Satellite images\n- Storm\n- Pollen (hay fever)\n- Sun (UV)\n- Mosquitos\n- BBQ\n- Temperature\n- Feeling temperature\n- Wind\n- Fog\n- Snow\n- EU Buienradar (rain radar)\n- EU Satellite images\n\nYou can find personalized weather info in the table “Komende uren in” (Next 8 hours weather prediction) for your favorite location (even abroad!) like hour-to-hour predictions for: temperature, feeling temperature, the number of millimeters of rain per hour, the chance of rain and wind force (in Beaufort).\n\nBesides thunderstorm, snow, sun, wind and temperature maps we also offer wind chill, ground temperature, sun intensity, air pressure, gusts, visibility and humidity data, together with the exact times of sunrise and sunset for your location.\n\nWe also offer seasonal radar maps. In the summer, for example, you can use our pollen and mosquito radars in order to receive a timely notification when it is wise to hang up your mosquito net. In the winter you can use our snowradar, which informs you about winter precipitation, but we also offer a map especially for ground temperature which warns you about night frost.\n\nIn the “14-daagse” tab (14 day forecast) you will find the weather forecast (in a graph) for the next 14 days. You can also see a detailed list view when you click on the tab “Lijst”. This list offers an hourly forecast for the next 7 days and a daily average for the second week.\n\nIn the “Meldingen” tab you can create your own rain alert (free push notification) customized to your daily time schedule and favorite locations so you will never be unprepared for rain or a storm.\n\nIf you don't want to see ads, we also offer the Buienradar Plus plan for €3,49 per year. You can find this easily in “Instellingen” (“Settings”) and then press “Neem Buienradar Plus” (Get Buienradar Plus).\n\nOur Terms of Use can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/gebruikers-voorwaarden.html\n\nOur Privacy statement can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/privacy-statement.html\n\nWe are continuously improving the Buienradar app. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve or if you have any questions, you can always reach out to us by using the feedback form in the app or by sending us an e-mail via appsupport@buienradar.nl. Thanks!"

      "label": "Aurora Now provides real-time predictions regarding the chances for auroral activity at your specific location right now as well as a forecast for the coming 30 minutes.\n\nOne of the most popular services we provide is the local aurora alert service. You can get instantly notified when there is a high chance for auroral activity at your location without having to check the app all the time. You can also get alert services for the solar wind data, Kp index, and hemispheric power. These extra services can be purchased within the app.\n\nThe app also provides predicted and observed Kp index, solar wind data directly from DSCOVR, such as solar wind speed and magnetic field (Bz and Bt), and graphs with recent data to help you predict auroral activity as well as the hemispheric power for the last 6 hours.\n\nThe app focuses much on the activity right now, but we also added a 3 day Kp forecast which can give you a hint which days you could expect higher activity. Enjoy!"

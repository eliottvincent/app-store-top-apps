With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

      "label": "Based on Joyce Meyer's New York Times bestseller Power Thoughts, this devotional includes 365 opportunities to tap into God's power in your daily life by thinking and speaking His way. The POWER THOUGHTS DEVOTIONAL will provide you with life-changing declarations of truth, directly from God's Word, to think and speak over your life every day of the year.\n\nThis daily app has a devotion search feature, customized daily push notifications, and the ability to combine your favorite passages with images into beautiful shareable 'Quotos'! \n\nProverbs 18:21 says, \"Death and life are in the power of the tongue.\" Simply put, words are containers for power--positive or negative, creative or destructive. Therefore, it is imperative that you learn to think and speak on purpose, using the life-giving wisdom in God's Word. When you do, your life will never be the same!\n\nIf you struggle with being negative, critical, or judgmental of people and situations, don't be discouraged. God wants to help you renew your mind to think and speak as He would. It won't happen overnight--but each day you will make progress as you choose power thoughts to be more like Jesus.\n\nIt's time for you to experience and enjoy the life God created you to live, and Joyce wants to help you get there. You can do it with this devotional by learning how to think and speak power thoughts daily."

The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\n“CHOMP by Christoph Niemann” is the latest imagination from internationally renowned children’s author and illustrator Christoph Niemann, whose App ‘Petting Zoo’ is already loved by millions of children and families around the world.\n\n‘CHOMP’ combines playful, humorous, and lovingly hand-drawn animations with live video, enabling children and adults alike to slip into a variety of comical roles. From a virtuous pianist, to a spaghetti-slurping dog, or a living cuckoo-clock, anything is possible!\n\nWhat makes this App so inspiring and special is that children participate using their own faces, mimicry, and song, allowing their creativity to run free.\n\nWith the video functions, all of these adventures can be saved forever. ‘CHOMP’ is so easy and intuitive to use that kids can create and sing their own personal messages to send to parents, grandparents, friends, or siblings, all in the blink of an eye.\n\nHighlights :\n\n•\tHand drawn animations made with love and care.\n•\tOver 50 hand-drawn scenes with countless funny animations.\n•\tFun for all ages.\n•\tNo language knowledge needed. The app is text-free.\n•\tNo in-app purchases, invasive advertising, or data mining.\n•\tRecord play sessions with integrated video recording.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n•\tChildren can swipe left and right to change animations. Tap the screen to see the fun.\n•\tGrownups can open the camera menu in the bottom left to record videos. Tap to microphone icon to enable sound recording, use the large center button to start and stop video recording.\n•\tPlease enable camera permissions when prompted.\n\nJust as with his App ‘Petting Zoo’ and his New York Times blog ‘Abstract City’, Christoph Niemann uses ‘CHOMP’ to once again show us his own unique, absurd, and always funny view of the world.\n\nPress reviews:\n\nwired.com:\n\"It’s not quite a storybook, and not quite a video game. It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\nPlease also check out our other great App for kids:\n\n“PETTING ZOO” - is a fantastic storybook app. It features beautiful, fun, interactive animations of over 20 animals, and it’s bound to be a big favorite for kids and animal lovers of all ages.\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

Your entire library - books, annotations, bookmarks, and all - is synced between devices via iCloud.\n\n■ PERSONALIZE YOUR READING EXPERIENCE\n\nHyphen comes packed with a ton of options for custom colors, fonts, font sizes, line heights, paragraph indentations, margins - ...well, you get the idea. You can even use styling on a per-book basis.\n\nAnd if that’s not enough, you can also add your own CSS. Cool, right?\n\n■ HIGHLIGHT AND ANNOTATE EFFORTLESSLY\n\nTap-and-drag or use the selection handles to highlight in any one of several available colors. Write notes for a highlight and refer to them any time you need to. You can also share highlights as images and post them to Twitter or Facebook, or export all your highlights  for use elsewhere.\n\n■ GOODREADS INTEGRATION\n\nUse Goodreads? We've got you covered - shelve books, make status updates and post quotes, all right from the app.\n\n■ ADD BOOKS WITH EASE\n\nAdd ePubs using your favorite cloud services - Dropbox, Google Drive, OPDS servers, and more. You can also use the in-app web browser to download ePubs, or add them using iTunes.\n\n======\n\nOTHER NOTABLE  FEATURES:\n\n■ NIGHT MODE\nTransition Hyphen's reading interface to soothing, darker colors at night.\n\n■ METADATA\nEdit the title, author, subjects, covers and more of your books. Hyphen can even lookup book covers and metadata for you.\n\n■ SHELVE & SORT\nAdd books to custom shelves, and sort by author, title, last read, or date added.\n\n■ CUSTOM CSS & FONTS\nHyphen lets you import both your favorite fonts for use while reading, as well as CSS.\n\n■ DEFINE & TRANSLATE\nTranslations of the text you're reading are only a tap away. Lookup words and terms in Wikipedia, Dictionary.com or Google.\n\n■ TWO COLUMN SUPPORT\nGot one of those large, spacious, king-sized, oh-my-lord-this-screen-is-so-big-I-should've-gotten-an-ipad-mini-instead,-its-so-big, why-is-it-so-big-sized screens? Use this setting to make reading more comfortable. You can also optionally only use two columns when your device is in landscape orientation.\n\n■ VOCABULARY\nAdd words to a vocabulary list and export them easily.\n\n■ INTERACTIVE\nTap and hold a link to open it in the in-app browser, or Safari. Images zoom in, letting you see every detail. Swipe through and jump between images throughout the text with the Image Viewer.\n\n■ ADE PAGES SUPPORT\nHyphen utilizes ADE pages, so you’ll always have a cross-reader compatible way of finding and noting where you are in a book.\n\n■ INCREDIBLY FAST\nDownload and import books in the blink of an eye. Hyphen’s ePub Rendering System is optimized so that there’s the least delay between you and the text.\n\n======\n\nCONTACT & SUPPORT\n\nNeed help or have a question?

      "label": "In celebration of selling 3 million copies, FaithWords is publishing a special expanded edition of “Battlefield of the Mind.” \n\nThis expanded audiobook edition includes an additional introduction read by Joyce Meyer, the audiobook as read by Pat Lentz, and updated content throughout the book; it does not include the book text. \n\nAs a bonus there is also a PDF, “The Battle of the Mind for Kids.”\n\nWorry, doubt, confusion, depression, anger and feelings of condemnation: all these are attacks on the mind. If readers suffer from negative thoughts, they can take heart! Joyce Meyer has helped millions win these all-important battles. In her most popular best seller ever, the beloved author and minister shows readers how to change their lives by changing their minds.\n\nShe teaches how to deal with thousands of thoughts that people think every day and how to focus the mind the way God thinks. And she shares the trials, tragedies, and ultimate victories from her own marriage, family, and ministry that led her to wondrous, life-transforming truth — and reveals her thoughts and feelings every step of the way.\n\nThis app is part of, and makes use of, the Folium Stellar™ network.\n\n• PLAYER CONTROLS.  Includes listen (play), pause, multi-speed fast forward/reverse, jump ahead/back, chapter skip, one-touch chapter- and bookmark browser. There is also a “scrub” bar that finds any point inside the chapter with just a tap.\n\n• SLEEP TIMER. Have you ever fallen asleep watching TV or listening to something? If so, you'll love this feature. Once set, the app will stop, place a bookmark, and allow you to jump back to where you probably began dozing.\n\n• CLEAR & ELEGANT DESIGN.  Simple, clean, intuitive, and smarter than average.\n\n• CHAPTER TIMINGS. Always know how much time it will take to finish a chapter.\n\n• OFFLINE LISTENING. You are airplane-ready! Once downloaded, listen uninterrupted without threat from a lost network connection. Downloads are usually just 5-10 minutes, but depend upon your network speed.\n\n• AUTO-BOOKMARKING.  The player remembers where you stopped listening and returns to that exact spot when you open the app again.\n\n• SOCIAL SHARING. An easy way to recommend the app to your friends."

It maintains all of the features that have made Strong's indispensable for over 100 years: \n- Allows the reader to easily find all biblical occurrences of a word in the King James Version\n- Points the reader to the underlying Hebrew and Greek words\n- Uses the Strong's numbering system which is used in many of the new study tools of today \n\nAnd adds new features that make it even more useful: \n- Corrected, updated, and expanded using the latest computing search tools\n- Extra-clear font and page design make this edition readable and easy to navigate\n- Updated and improved Hebrew and Greek dictionaries tie each word to the Greek or Hebrew root\n- Discover the Hebrew and Greek words underlying the KJV English using the Strong's numbering system\n- Use the updated Hebrew and Greek dictionaries to find brief definitions of each word of the original languages\n\nGo beyond mere searches for lost verses and hone your skills by utilizing this tool's more advanced features.\n\nFind every occurrence of any word in the King James Version Bible. Only the words not likely to be used in locating a passage have been eliminated (words such as should, those, and when) or condensed to include only the important occurrences (words such as bring, day, and might). \n\nStudents of the Bible utilize the wealth of resources offered in Strong's ranging from doing word and thematic studies to probing the deeper meanings embedded in the original languages of the Bible."

The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

      "label": "** Children's Technology Review Editor's Choice\n\n“OOPS…” Blue Hat, Green Hat, Sandra Boynton’s famous and funny book, comes alive with sound and zestily ingenious interactivity. This wonderfully clever digital book app will surprise kids and grownups alike. Turkeys may also enjoy it, if they can ever figure out how to turn the dang thing on.\n\nThree earnest animals and one misguided turkey learn colors and clothes. Though admittedly, the turkey never quite gets the hang of it.\n\n“I have a particular fondness for Blue Hat, Green Hat. At age three, my son Devin had a surprisingly hearty laugh for a small person—a laugh that would make everyone else laugh. I created this book long ago specifically to elicit that belly-laugh from him. It was great fun to re-invent this book as an interactive e-book app, collaborating again with my endlessly clever Loud Crow friends. The digital dimension gave us so many terrific opportunities for adding theatrical flair to this spare yet decidedly Vaudeville book.” - Sandra Boynton\n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Blue Hat, Green Hat interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery.\n\nThe third Sandra Boynton book app, all of them created in collaboration between Boynton Moo Media along with the award-winning developer Loud Crow Interactive. Blue Hat, Green Hat follows their wonderful top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app, and the glorious bestselling Moo, Baa, La La La! app\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Touch the animals to prompt them to move and respond.\n* Touch “OOPS” to cause a different surprise on each page.\n* Tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade.\n* Dress the turkey with colorful pop-in/pop-out clothes\n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations, and also added new touch-animations\n* Wonderful resonant and wry narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer\n* Includes a original sounds and soundtrack, “William Mattel Overture,” a melody for toy crank-guitar, written by Sandra Boynton, performed by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book\n* “The Big Guy Reads It” narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” to hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

Of course!\n\n* There are teeth to brush, and a group exercise session with ten pajama-clad animals (big and small) each with its own unique exercise.\n\n* Help the little piggy turn off the lights, then rock yourself to sleep to the music box sound of beautiful twinkling stars.\n\n* There's something wonderful to discover on every page.\n\n* \"The Big Guy Reads It\" narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills \n\n* Or “I want to read it myself” and hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\n* Wonderful resonant and gentle narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer \n\n* Boynton’s original text and illustrations for her popular The Going to Bed Book (over 5 million in print!) \n\nBoynton adds, “Of course The Going to Bed Book app is first and foremost for children, and I know they will be captivated and delighted. But it’s also perfect for agitated high-level executives. What a great evening-time alternative to reviewing the minutes of last week’s Near-Term Strategic Wombat Acquisitions meeting.” \n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

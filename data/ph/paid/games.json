A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.

Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!"

Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dire future.\n\nAs the overwhelming despair of this new world surrounds you, how will you survive? Your approach to the countless moral choices you’ll be faced with on a daily basis, could be the difference between the lives of your family or their unfortunate end. Resources are scarce though, with barely enough to cling desperately to life for another day you’re already faced with a monumental choice. Who will you send to venture out into the vast unforgiving wasteland? Whilst exploration is a traumatic experience, the weapons you can craft from resources could tip the scales of life or death in your favour. Assaults from feral beasts and roaming factions are endlessly closing in, imminent and deadly risks surround you.\n ‘Violence is never the answer’… Maybe you once believed that, but combat may now be your only option for survival. As you and your family grow and progress, so do their skills, attributes and weaknesses. Ensure that they’re well equipped as you strategize, securing victory against those who threaten the survival of your family in tense turn based combat."

The hero, though separated now from childhood friends, partners up with the cheerful Navirou, and embarks upon a new adventure into the world of hunters.\n\n[Important Notes]\n•　Compatible Devices (Models / Supported OS)\nPlease visit the official website for details.\n•　How to Access the Website\nTap “Developer Website” on this page or access the following link:\nhttps://www.us.capcommobile.com/mhs-device-compatibility\nNote: We cannot guarantee the app’s performance or offer refunds if you use a device not listed as compatible.\n\n•　Notes on Multiplayer\n- Multiplayer (Network Battles, etc.) is available only after a certain amount of game progress.\n- Network Battles are only available against other players of the paid iOS version of this app.\n- Network Battles are not available against players of the Japanese version of this app.\n- Play in an area with a good connection to ensure the best online experience.\n- You must sign in to Game Center to use multiplayer features.\n\n•　Additional Notes\n- To use this app, you must agree to the \"Monster Hunter Stories End User License Agreement\" (link below) when booting the app for the first time.\nhttps://game.capcom.com/manual/MHST_mobile/global/en/rule.php\n- This app features the same story as the handheld console version.\n- Several handheld console features, such as certain collaboration contents, amiibo features, local Network Battles, and StreetPass, are NOT available in this version.\n- Deleting this app will also erase any stored save data.\n- We recommend that you connect to a Wi-Fi network before downloading.\n- Battle Party QR codes from the Japanese version will not work in this version."

Keep your focus as you guide two orbiting planets down a path without breaking their perfect equilibrium.\n\nIt's pretty hard to describe, but you should play the free online version on a desktop computer first if you are not sure if you would enjoy this game!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- More than 10 worlds, each introducing new shapes and rhythms. What do triangles, octagons or squares sound like? Each world starts with small tutorial stages and ends with a final test.\n\n- Post-game challenges: Speed Trials for each world and a blisteringly fast bonus level for the brave.\n\n- Calibration options: auto-calibration and manual calibration. This is a precise rhythm game, so use your ears more than your eyes when playing.\n\n- Play new levels for free: more levels will be added over the coming months.\n\nWARNING: This is a hard rhythm game. Not in the sense of note-spamming - for the most part all you have to do is keep a consistent beat - but this is a good test of whether you would be a good drummer. Keeping a beat is not very easy, and then weird breakbeats are added on top of that, so don't worry if you find it difficult!"

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

Set across three continents during the turbulent Middle Ages, spectacular conflicts and scheming rivals line the path to power as the great kingdoms of the medieval world vie for supremacy. Be it through diplomacy or conquest, trade or subterfuge, you must secure the resources and loyalty required to rule an empire from the shores of Western Europe to the sands of Arabia.\n\nTHE STRENGTH OF NATIONS\nUnlock up to 17 playable factions and build them into major world powers through statecraft, subterfuge or all-out war.\n\nTHE KINGDOMS EXPANSION\nAvailable via in-app purchase, this massive expansion includes 24 playable factions across four unique, fully featured campaigns. Wage war from the jungles of the Americas to the deserts of the Holy Land, from the deceptively gentle shores of the British Isles to the frigid Baltic plains.\n\nTHE ART OF WAR\nDeploy infantry, archers and cavalry into huge real-time battles, with a full range of medieval weaponry at your command.\n\nTHE TOOLS OF STATE\nUse sophisticated diplomacy, lucrative trade agreements and daring agents to forge alliances or destabilise your rivals.\n\nTHE TEST OF TIME\nShape the destinies of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East through five momentous centuries of combat, competition and conquest.\n\nTHE POWER IN YOUR HANDS\nTake command, with a brand-new user interface and enhanced touch controls for fingertip control of the battlefield. Or, play with any iPadOS-compatible mouse & keyboard.\n\n===\n\nTotal War: MEDIEVAL II requires 4.3GB of free space.

In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.\n\nThe stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland.

It's your job to schedule the band's stops over your 100-day tour, visiting as many states as possible.\n\nEach turn in On Tour, two ten-sided dice are rolled to make two two-digit numbers. For example, a roll of 3 and 7 creates the numbers 37 and 73. All players write each of those numbers in a state on their map. The regions they can write in are restricted by three cards turned up in the middle of the table.\n\nAt the end of the game, each player draws a route on their map, starting with a low number and visiting adjacent states with higher and higher numbers. Players get a point for every state they visit.\n\nThere are also some bonus points available, a way to get wilds, and a variable set-up step that makes every game different."

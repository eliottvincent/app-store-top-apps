Color scheme by Itten is typically used by artists, and RGB is designed for online use. For both of them you can apply one of the 10 color combinations \\ harmonies.\n\nAbility to extract colors from your image\nSelect the desired picture from your phone and application's algorithms will extract colors. Then  you can choose favorite colors and save the palette.\n\nGet matching colors to your custom color\nJust type in your color code and discover color harmonies with this particular color.\n\nUse color editing tool\nIt is very important to balance the quantitative ratio of color in order to make your palette look harmonious in practice. The application has a convenient function to quickly swap colors in the images. There are 3 pictures and gradient in the palette editing carousel. You can see how the selected colors look in different ratios. \n\nEasy to manage and share\nAlso you will be able to save, export and remove palettes. To share the desired palette just choose mode — text HEX codes or image. You can always copy a particular color code under color swatch to the clipboard.\n\nDeveloping Color Gear we tried to make it professional and easy to use.

      "label": "Featured in Watercolor Artist Magazine, Artists Magazine, LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\n\nDa Vinci Eye is the essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills."

      "label": "Yes, this app will help you draw like a pro!\n\nWhether you're drawing on paper with a pencil, or cookies with royal icing, Camera Lucida will help you become a better artist.\n\nBe sure to read the reviews and the functionality you get with Camera Lucida!  There are lots of competitors and we know Camera Lucida costs a bit more, but no other app comes anywhere close to matching the functionality you get with 12 years of software development and refinement!\n\nUnlike hundreds of apps that enable you to create digital art, Camera Lucida instead enables you to create amazing physical art!  Our app works by having your iPhone or iPad's camera pointed at your drawing surface.  By watching your screen as you draw, you will be able to to see your reference image superimposed with your drawing - guiding your hand as little or as much as you want while you create your art.  Better than a projector and more versatile than a light table, Camera Lucida has been fine-tuned for over a decade to provide artists with the features they need to be accurate and creative.\n\nFor over a century, artists have made use of the camera lucida optical device to superimpose a live view of their subject onto their drawing or painting surface.  Allowing the artist to trace what they see in front of them, the camera lucida is an invaluable aid in creating a lifelike and realistic drawing.  Truly a camera lucida for the 21st century!\n\nWith our Camera Lucida iPhone/iPad application, artists and non-artists alike can now draw anything they have a photo of.  When looking at your screen, you'll be able to simultaneously see the image you want to draw as well as your drawing surface as you create your work of art.  Camera Lucida isn’t a projector, instead the app shows you a virtual image and you draw by watching your paper and hand on the screen as you draw!  It’s really clever and cool!\n\nWith over 12 years of continuous development, Camera Lucida's functionality eclipses the competition.  Check out these features:\n   -  Advanced image filters to help you see with an artist's eye.\n   -  Multi-device support to enable you to stream live video of your drawing to a second device.  *Requires iOS 10.3 or higher to receive hosted video.  Also, newer devices are recommended due to the processing requirements.*\n   -  Support for saving and restoring sessions, including automatically realigning your camera, sketch and reference image.\n   -  Full color palette control, including using your own paints, markers, etc.\n   -  Use any camera on your device and adjust for tilted and mirrored setups manually, or use an in-app purchase do do it automatically.\n   -  Secondary video feed support to enable you to draw from a live subject, not just a photograph.   *Requires iOS 10.3 or higher to receive hosted video.*\n   -  Time-lapsed recordings of you creating your drawing you can share on social media.  \n   -  Support for external bluetooth keyboards to aid in creating large art through mirroring your display.\n   -  Advanced tools such as vertical split screen sliders, timed image fading in and out, etc.\n   -  A projector mode that can be used when you’re using the app with a projector.\n   -  Video tutorials you can watch from within the app or from YouTube.\n   -  A full user manual available from within the app.\n   -  Continued support for iOS all the way back to 9.3 with only minor restrictions on functionality.\n   -  Customer support that you can count on and an active user community for inspiration.\n\nTo use our application, you just place your iPhone or iPad between your drawing surface and your eyes and trace what you see on the screen!\n\nIMPORTANT:  To use Camera Lucida, you need to fix your iPhone or iPad in place above your drawing.  We use a stack of books or a flower vase to do this.  Tutorials are included in the app to help you get started.  Also, some advanced functions such as receiving the multi-device video feed require iOS 10.3 or higher.\n\nContact: lucidaPete@gmail.com"

The starting material can then be upscaled at will.\n\nImport, Convert, Export\nConverting a pixel-based-graphic (e.g. a photo, drawing, etc.) into a resolution-independent vector graphic with Vectorize! is quite self-explanatory: First, simply choose a file, or use your iPhone to take a picture – and then let Vectorize! do the rest. Using your iPhone to take a photo to directly import into Vectorize! is another very practical option at your disposal.\n\nYour options for importing are:\n• JPG\n• PNG\n• TIFF\n• HEIC\n• GIF\n\nAfter your graphic has been selected and imported, you can determine the desired level of detail of your result and if additional contours or edge smoothing should be applied, after which the final product is only click on “Export” away. \n\n\nYour options for exporting are:\n• PDF\n• SVG\n• Logoist file – for further subsequent editing"

It projects any photo you've selected from your photo library on any paper or sketch books you prefer drawing on. \n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens allows you to trace out the images you want to draw before shading. But it is more than a tracing tool, as it also allows you to capture areas of different tones and highlights - achieving a more lifelike picture. \n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens is a great tool for portrait drawing.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens can also be used in short drawing/sketching practices for beginners.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens enables even beginners to make stunning drawings. \n\n◉ Through its precise algorithms, what is traditionally difficult, such as portraits, can now be done without the need of construction lines.   \n\n◉ This app works on most phones without using Apple's ARKit which can only run on newer high performance chips. It's a simple effective tool for a simple hobby.\n\n*** See \"Developer's website\" below for a video demo\n\n*** A Youtube channel (see \"Developer's website\") is set up to provide you with examples of Vermeer's Lens in action. Content will be regularly uploaded so long as there are people interested in this app.\n\n*** This app works on most phones without using Apple's ARKit which can only run on newer high performance chips. It is simple, reliable and stable.\n________________________________________________________\nHow it works :\n\n> a photo is chosen from your photo library and  “projected” over the paper to draw on.\n\n> This projection is achieved by imaging the paper on the phone screen, and overlaying the translucent photo onto it.\n\n> With the phone held in a phone-holder, you can use its screen as a lens, through which you trace out the photo onto the paper.\n\n> Phone can be tilted and rotated to the angle most comfortable to you, while Vermeer’s Lens transforms the photo to match the perspective of the paper.\n\n> Not just the outlines, even the different subtle tones and contours of a face could be captured, to get that 3-D effect.\n\n> Opacity of the overlaying photo could be adjusted to allow close comparison between your drawing and the photo.\n\n> The overlaying photo responds to on-screen gesture: you could move, scale and rotate the photo during sketching.\n\n> A zoom option allows you to zoom in on your drawing for delicate pencil work.\n\nin addition :\n\n> A Vermeer’s Lens channel is also created on youtube to provide our users with additional \"instructions & tutorials\"on the use of this app to create art (videos updated regularly).\n\nThis is linked directly to the app via the  “Demo” button.\n\n> You can email us for support/feedback directly via the “Contact Us” button on the main menu of the app. Or leave a message (go to the “about” tab) on our youtube channel    (see “Developer’s website” below).\n\nFor more info and demo:\n\n> See “Developer’s website” below"

      "label": "ArtRage Vitae is our Premium Natural Painting application for mobile devices!\r\n\r\nGet creative on your digital canvas with realistic color blending, mixing oil paint, delicate watercolor, and much more! Ever wanted to try painting your masterpiece but were put off by the mess and expense? Now you can!\r\n\r\nArtRage Vitae isn't just about color: It knows how much paint you've used so you can mix it and spread it on a textured canvas. It knows how wet your paint is so you can blend it with other paints. It even knows about the roughness of your paper so your pencils can be used for soft shading.\r\n\r\nIt's not just a special effect either - ArtRage Vitae is a live simulation of the properties of real artistic media that lets you get creative with colors and textures using tools you already know how to use!\r\n\r\nArtRage Vitae takes full advantage of the Apple Pencil support for pressure & tilt, and 3D touch on your iPhone when available.\r\n\r\nJoin the ArtRage community:\r\nForums: forums.artrage.com\r\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/artrage\r\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/artrage_paint/\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nReal world painting tools: Oils, Watercolors, Paint Rollers, Pencils, Crayons and more. Each tool has a range of familiar properties such as how much thinner is applied to the paint, or how soft a pencil tip is. Tools apply texture as well as color, and blend under the brush.\r\n\r\nAdd Layers to your painting and work on individual elements without damaging others. ArtRage supports a wide range of layer effects, layer blend modes, and layer contents can be scaled moved and rotated independently.\r\n\r\nImport images, converting them to oil paint for mixing and blending or as Reference Images pinned to the canvas as a visual guide. Load photos as Tracing Images which are overlaid on the canvas, and have ArtRage select colors automatically as you paint.\r\n\r\nThe interface has been designed to maximize your creative space without hiding away critical functions such as tool and color selection. As you paint, it gets out of the way so that you don’t have to stop and manually adjust panels.\r\n\r\nRecord your paintings! The ArtRage Script system lets you record strokes while you paint for playback in desktop versions of the product at higher resolution.\r\n\r\nShare your paintings on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Creative Cloud, Dropbox, DeviantArt or any other sharing app on your device.\r\n\r\nTools:\r\n\r\n• Oil Brush, Watercolor, Airbrush, Palette Knife, Paint Roller, Paint Tube, Inking Pen, Pencil, Marker Pen, Chalk, Crayon, Glitter Tube, Gloop Pen, Eraser, Flood Fill, Cloner.\r\n\r\n• Paint simulation monitors the physical properties of your paints to allow natural blending, smearing, and other real world behavior.\r\n\r\n• Preset support to save your favorite settings for later use.\r\n\r\n• Supports the Apple Pencil's Pressure and Tilt properties, and 3D Touch where available to add realism to the simulated paint strokes.\r\n\r\nLayers:\r\n\r\n• Unlimited layers with Photoshop standard blend modes, visibility and opacity controls. Scale, rotate, and position layer contents independently.\r\n\r\nUtilities:\r\n\r\n• Record your paintings as Scripts then play them back in a desktop version of ArtRage.\r\n\r\n• Unlimited Undo / Redo. Load photos as References or Tracing images.\r\n\r\n\r\nFiles:\r\n\r\n• 4096 x 4096 Canvas now available on all devices.\r\n\r\n• Control the texture and color of the canvas to create different effects. Canvas presets can be stored for later.\r\n\r\n• Export PTG, JPG or PNG to services such as Email, Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox, and more. Share images on Facebook or Twitter. Import photos to a new file or a layer, with camera support.\r\n\r\nInterface:\r\n\r\n• Easy access pods provide functionality without getting in the way. Elements vanish as you paint so you can paint underneath. Multi-Touch shortcuts for canvas manipulation, Undo/Redo, and Brush Size.\r\n\r\nStylus & Input Support:\r\n\r\n• Apple Pencil Pressure & Tilt.\r\n• Supports 3D Touch.\r\n• Includes support for Wacom, Adonit and Pogo styluses."

This app will create templates with the appropriate tapered sides and curves for a perfect fit.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS AND FEATURES\n\nTop - Measure the circumference of the container where the top of your label will be positioned, and enter this value into the top numeric field.\n\nBottom - Measure the circumference of the container where the bottom of your label will be positioned, enter this value into the bottom numeric field.\n\nHeight - Measure the height of your label, or distance between the top and bottom positions. Enter this value into the height numeric field.\n\nRounded Corners - If you desire rounded corners, enter a numeric radius value. A zero value will create squared off corners.\n\nCoverage - The default value of 100% will create a label that wraps around the container with no gap or overlap. When you increase the value above 100%, the label will overlap by that percentage amount. If you decrease the value below 100%, the label will have a gap or space equal to that percentage. Press the round button next to \"Coverage\" to display the unit value of the percentage.\n\nHEADER (Optional)\n\nTitle - Enter any custom name that will be displayed at the top of your PDF template. \n\nDescription - Enter a brief description of the label that will be displayed under the name.\n\nSettings (saved, but can be revised)\n\nUnits of Measure - Select measurement values of millimeters or Inches.\n\nRounding - Select the number of decimal places for all displayed values.\n\nContact Information - You can enter your contact information that displays at the bottom of each template.\n\nSAVE\n\nTo save your template, press the Template icon at the bottom right corner which creates a PDF. The Mail icon in the upper right hand corner will create an email attachment of your PDF template. The message will include the values entered for your template.\n\nTIPS\n\nMeasuring Suggestion - You can use a string, or flexible wire, to determine the circumference. Then lay the string flat and use a ruler to measure the string length.\n\nPerfect Fit - First measure and enter your values without a corner radius, using 100% for the coverage. Next, email and print out the PDF template. You can then make any adjustments that may be necessary. Then input your corner radius and coverage values and make another PDF."

It is great for beginners who want to learn drawing and it is perfect for advanced users who want to improve even more!\n\nRicalko has many smart features that let you achieve the results your aiming to, but in few words it is able to virtually project photos, so you can trace them on a paper sheet, an easel or on any other surface! You don't have to be a professional artist to reach amazing results. \nHow is it able to do that? In normal mode you have to put your device onto a stand (DIY works too, like a simple glass), with the camera pointing to a sheet of paper below for example.

If you don't have drawing skills, just fill in all the spots, and a painting will be automatically generated.\n\nIt is highly recommended to preprocess the photo before painting. Preprocessing effects include:\n1. A large number of color presets with adjustable intensity;\n2. Turbulence - simulates the effect of pigment dispersion;\n3. Grain - simulates the effect of pigment in granular form;\n4. Abstract - Simulates the painter's style.\n\nWe provide oil brushes, watercolor brushes, pencils, charcoal brushes, chalks, coal brushes, pastel brushes, pens and other brushes simulating realistic effects, and also can customize brushes. The parameters that the brush can adjust include: size, hardness, point distance, angle, opacity, texture. Real-time preview of adjustment effect. The smaller the brush adjustment is, the closer the details of the painted part are to the real photo. There is no need to undo, just use a different brush to re-apply where you have applied, and it will automatically cover.\n\nPainting strokes are smoothed with Bezier curves.\nYou can zoom the canvas using a two-finger pinch gesture, and use at least two fingers to move the canvas to view and draw details.\nClick \"Paint\" to enter the free creation mode, in this mode you can choose a color from the color picker to paint yourself. Normal mode and free creation mode can be switched arbitrarily and used together to express your creativity.\n\nYou can add fun stickers to your creations.\n\nThe brightness of the photo under the canvas can be adjusted; if it is adjusted to 0, the photo will not be visible, so that the effect of the current work can be previewed. Can clear the canvas and all preprocessing effects. You can save the current project progress or save your work or save a preprocessed photo. There are also functions such as eraser, full screen, and sharing.\n\n\"Paint Can\" feature: AI automatically paints your photos! The face mask is enabled by default in the \"Paint Can\", which means that when painting the detected face area, a smaller brush will be used to maintain facial details. You can also turn off the face mask.\n\nIn the Pro version, you can import unlimited photos from your device to create works.\nPro version is a one-time purchase. No subscriptions."

      "label": "To create a custom filter, use the built-in basic image filters and combine them.\nYou can also load previously recorded images/videos and record/export.\n\nFilter\nCustom filters are created by connecting filters selected from over 150 collections in series.\nFor instance, you can do the following:\nCamera input-> [Mirror effect-> Monochrome effect-> Glitch effect]-> Display / Recorder\n\nThe items inside [] are called chains and can be selected and rearranged as you please.\nThis chain can be saved, and once created and saved, it can be loaded with one tap.\nThere are so many filters that it is hard to find immediately, but you can find them by searching or categorizing.\nThe filters include a built-in iOS filter called Core Image Filter (* 1) and a POLYCAM original filter created with Metal (* 2) shader.\nThe Loop filter has a built-in feedback circuit that allows you to re-read the output of the previous frame, making it ideal for more experimental video generation and circuit bending.\nGeneric filters such as StarShine, SunBeam, Lenticular Halo, and Gradient are also included, so you can create generated images.\n\nOutput\nFull screen output without indicators of 4 outputs.\nHDMI, AirPlay, NDI®, Aether, are possible.\nUsing smooth alpha transitions for almost all transitions, you can create a smooth production when projecting full-screen images using Outputs.\n\nExport\nIf the source input is selected from photos or videos in the photo album, it can be asynchronously exported to the photo album.\nThis is different from real-time recording at the time of shooting, and is written in non-real time for each frame.\nSmooth videos can be saved even at resolutions and settings that lack the power of the CPU or GPU.\n\nParametrics\nEach filter has several parameters that you can adjust with the sliders to adjust the filter's balance and effect.\nParameters can be automated with the LFO oscillator or random generator.\nYou can also assign audio input peaks from microphones, accelerometers, gyro sensors, MIDI inputs, etc. for interactive control and create audio visualizers.\n\nSettings\nCamera select (internal / external, double, triple also available)\nAspect ratio (Original, 1: 1, 3: 4, 9:16, 4: 3, 16: 9)\nResolution (Original, QD, HD, FHD)\nMicrophone gain\nNDI® on / off (*3)\nAether wireless sender bit rate (*4)\nTint color change\nRotation lock\n\nSaving, sharing, and exporting Chains\nThe created chain can be saved with the save button at the lower right of the chain table view.\nThe saved chains are arranged in the collection view, and the chains can be loaded by tapping or dragging and dropping.\nYou can share the chain by dragging and dropping it on the share mark.\nYou can send it to macOS or save it to the File app.\nExporting the settings will share the entire collection in the current chain. You can save all the filters you have created or share them with someone.

      "label": "“Before the needle even hits the skin, there is the crucial step that sets the tone for the entire tattoo - applying the stencil.  Stencilling tattoos on the body is an art unto itself.  Great tattoos start with great stencils, and great stencils start with the ideal image.  The better you can see what you’re doing, the more accurate your linework is gonna be.  Over 20 years of tattooing mostly geometric tattoos has forced me to intensely analyze the art of stencilling and push it to its limits, and through this app I’ve been able to push them even farther.  Increasing efficiency and accuracy in my work has always been a passion of mine, and I can’t wait to share this with my fellow tattooers” \n-Cory Ferguson\n\nThe easy to use Tattoo Print System gives you tools to customize and enhance your images right before you print them out so they’re ready to go straight into the stencil machine and result in the best stencils possible.  No matter what style you tattoo in, this app will save you time and level up your stencil game.   Giving you the ability to dial in your finished designs to your liking so when they come out of the stencil machine they are more precise and personalized to how you like to work.  \n\nThese are tools that every single tattoo artist has always needed!\n\nOnce installed you can access Tattoo Print System from any app on your iPad or iPhone that has the share button as an option (you know- that icon that looks like a little box containing an arrow pointing up)\n\nSo how does Tattoo Print System save you time and make your stencils better? \n\n-Print out large scale tattoos at actual size!  Measure out the size your tattoo will be on the body and enter those measurements into Tattoo Print System and let the app do the rest.  It automatically breaks the design into as many sheets of paper as needed and prints them out ready to go straight into the stencil machine.  No more resizing on a photocopier!  \n\n-Multi-page stencils need to be taped together as any experienced tattooer will know.  We’ve included tools to help with this task too.  Optional guidelines and image overlaps make it quicker and easier to line up the image when taping stencil pages together.    \n\n-Convert any image into just outlines with a single click \nWe’re tattooers - we all love showing off that crispy linework.  Enhancing your designs with the convert to lines feature eliminates excess ink from your stencils making them cleaner, easier to see and ultimately more precise.  And you don’t have to spend time tracing the outline yourself, the app does it for you.  You can also fine tune those outlines to be thicker or thinner depending on your preference.  \n\n-Convert realistic and shaded images into halftone dots or crosshatching for stencils that have shading in them.  \n\n-Fine tune the contrast, shadows and highlights of your designs to take a “not so great” reference picture and turn it into the sort of design that makes for a perfect stencil.  Often times a picture of the reference that you take on your phone can be enhanced with our adjustment sliders into a truly stencil worthy image.   \n\n-Add an optional, customizable grid to your stencil as a visual reference to help see if your image is level on the body.  This is especially useful for doing symmetrical pieces across the width of the torso, ie full chest piece, back piece.   \n\n-The ability to stretch out a design if necessary, by adjusting the width and height separately. \n\n-Customizable grid images to print out and stencil to help with freehand drawing onto the skin.  Choose from square, isometric and polar grid.  \n\nThis printing system is already a part of our other app Geometrica - the first ever drawing app created for tattooers.  So if you’re a Geometrica subscriber you don’t need Tattoo Print System, you already have it.  But it was so ground breaking we had to also release it as it’s own app, because this is something that all tattooers need, not just the geometric artists."

We have made it easy and fast to 3D scan real objects, modify them in-app, export the result into many 3D file formats, platforms and 3D printers and even magically bring them to life with animations. A perfect tool for AR/VR (Augmented Reality) content creation, 3D Printing, STEM Education, eCommerce showcase and many other uses.\n\nSCANNING\nScanning real objects has never been easier. Print the included AR mat, place your object in the middle of the mat and let the Augmented Reality dome guide you through the scanning process. Scan the object from two different angles and it will be auto merged for better and more complete 3D results.\n\nWith Qlone, there is no waiting time, all processing is done live on your phone in seconds.\n\nPrint the mat directly from the app with AirPrint or send it as a mail and print out.\n\nMODIFYING\nWith the integrated tools in the app so you can optimize and modify your 3D model without needing to export them.\n\nTexture - Change the Brightness, Saturation and Sharpness of the 3D model. Pick colors from the scanned object and apply them by painting directly on the 3D model. Blur areas or transitions for smoother results.\nClean - Improve the quality of the model by erasing unwanted areas or smoothing the surface. \nSculpt - Improve or alter the shape of your object by pressing or pulling a selected area and adjust the transition.\nShape - Enhance the mesh details or set the scale size of your model for 3D printing, simplify the mesh for lower file size export.\nArt - Turn your object into scaled cubes or meshed objects of art, ready to be printed.\n\nAR View + Animation:\nYou can beam your 3D models back to reality and bring them to life with automatic rigging and animation.\n\nEXPORTING and IMPORTING:\nExport your model directly to platforms like SketchFab, i.materialise, Lens Studio, Shapeways and CGTrader. Models can be exported in a variety of formats for use in other 3D tools – OBJ, STL, FBX, USDZ, GLB (Binary glTF) which includes animation, PLY, X3D. \n\nShare your models with friends as an image, video or GIF through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Email and iMessage.\n\nYou can import any 3D model into Qlone. Import in any 3D format (40+ formats) to view, modify or bring it to life in AR with our automatic animation!\n\nPRIVACY POLICY:\nhttp://eyecue-tech.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=143\n\nTERMS OF USE:\nhttp://eyecue-tech.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=142"

Make art or just use it to chill out - it's the digital equivalent of popping bubblewrap! \n\nWe look forward to seeing your artwork on the Facebook Qixel gallery! Facebook.com/qixelgallery\n\nHere's what you can do with Qixel HD: \n\n- Draw pictures with 4 different pixel types: Squares, Circles, Diamonds and Triangles. \n\n- The canvas background button flips between black or white. This has a very different effect on your qixels. \n\n- Use the darken and lighten buttons to add shade and depth to your art. \n\n- The triangle setting has an extra button: Rotation. Try rotating your triangles 90 degrees to make strange patterns and origami-style art. \n\n- Use Qixel to make quirky typography. \n\n- Write simple messages and greeting cards to send to friends. \n\n- Make cool patterns and abstract backgrounds for websites. \n\n- Create retro game graphics, and then export frames in stages to make animation. \n\n- experiment with colour: great for artists and colour therapy teachers. \n\nALLOW The PHOTO PERMISSION\n\n- Qixel HD will ask you to permission to access your photos. Clicking 'OK' will allow you to save high res PNG files to your device's Camera Roll. \n\n- The Photo button saves a high-res PNG screenshot to your iPad's camera roll. \n\nMake sure you allow the Photo permission in your iOS device's restrictions.\n\nGo to Settings > General > Restrictions > Privacy > Photos > Switch Qixel HD on.\n\niOS 12:  Settings > Screen Time > Content and Privacy Restrictions > Photos > Switch Qixel HD on.\n\n\nhese aren't just Pixels... these are Qixels!"

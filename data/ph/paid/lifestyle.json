On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

It also provides a description for each phase, sign and mansion. You can navigate through the information in various ways — say, phase-by-phase, day-by-day or month-by-month - whatever is more convenient for you. \n\nPhases show you the energy of the day, signs — the mood of the day, while the void-of-course periods might tell you when it is better not to do certain things. Mansions were used by different cultures from the time immemorial, they tell for what a particular day is good or not so good.\n\nTo calculate the times, iLuna uses the time zone of the device on which it runs, so if your iPhone or iPod touch shows your current time correctly, iLuna's information is precise too.\n\nOnce any of the events reported by iLuna happens, you will get a notification, provided you allowed the app to send you notifications."

Get ELIT now so you don't miss it.\n\n\"Now your drone can face any direction while moving.\"\n\n\"No more mentally switching left-right & front-back when the drone is flying towards you.\"\n\n ●●● Features that are already available ●●●\n• Course Lock - Any forward input will bring it towards the current heading & any reverse input will bring it away from that heading. No matter where the drone is facing after that.\n• Home Lock - Allows the drone to face any direction, pulling back on the stick will always move it towards the home point.\n• Normal Mode - Moving the stick forward will bring the drone to wherever it’s facing. If the direction of the drone is changed, the heading will change accordingly.\n• Elit works perfectly with iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. Purchase once for all your devices.\n• Fully supports landscape orientation. Works seamlessly with your DJI Go 4 app.\n\nOh yes, it's a one-time purchase, FREE future updates forever. We have planned some big updates for Elit. You'll like it!\n\n●●● How to use? ●●●\nAs easy as 1-2-3.\n1. Connect your device to DJI controller & aircraft.\n2. Launch this app. Tap \"Apply & Fly\".\n3. DONE! You will be redirected to DJI Go 4 app. Continue flying your drone with the newly unlocked control mode.\n\n\n●●● What is Course Lock? ●●●\nThe other drones manufacturers call it \"Headless Mode\". It allows new pilots to control the input of a drone. They can set and handle the orientation of the drone without changing its direction. No matter where your drone’s front side is pointing, moving the stick forward will always make the drone go forward in your current point of view.\n\nFor kids & even adults who use drones for fun, flying a drone with Course Lock feature is the best option they can have. This feature minimises the chances of drone crashes thus avoids damage. Entry-level drones (such as DJI Spark & DJI Mavic Air) are the ones which most require the Course Lock & Home Lock mode.\n\nAny questions, request, etc. can be addressed to elit [at] danielvw [dot] com.\nAnd if you like Elit, please share your love by rating & reviewing it on the App Store. Thank you!\n\nHappy Droning!"

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

Put the Bible into your daily life. Every time you look at your device! \n\nFEATURES: \n\n- Over 1,100 custom Bible-based iPhone & iPod Touch Lock Screens \n- iOS 9 Support & Design\n- Thumbnail view!\n- Categories (New, Popular, Love, Relationships, Encouragement, Prayer, etc.)\n- 15-second Video Devotionals (from our Instagram page)\n- Universal App optimized for iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch! \n- iPad-specific images, perfect for Landscape & Portrait modes\n- Tap and hold to save to your Camera Roll on your device \n- Many more Bible Lock Screens™ (not available online) \n- Suggest a Verse (suggest verses for new Bible Lock Screens™) \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\niPhone users look at their lock screen many times a day, to use their phone, to check the time, or to use one of the millions of apps available on the iOS platform. \n\nThe lock screen appears for about eight seconds and is the first thing you see when you use your iPhone. Eight seconds is a lot of time to be looking at something random. Why not use a background with Scripture on it! \n\nMy heart is that these Bible Lock Screen backgrounds would help remind you of what the Word of God says and help you walk it out. \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\nAPP STORE REVIEWS: \n\n\"This app is a GREAT buy! By far the best Christian wallpaper app in the AppStore. Such a great way to be encouraged daily by God's word in beautiful art form for your iPhone!\" - Kim S. (iTunes User) \n\n\"This has been so awesome! The variety of lock/home screens available is practically endless. I also love the new update. Flows great! What a great way to profess your faith in the 21st century. Get it!!\" - Lando25 (iTunes User) \n\n\"What a blessing it is to have this app! I'm able to encourage other people by sending them a pic. And when I look at my phone I get to be reminded of my sweet Savior the Lord Jesus Christ! Thanks a million times over! - Torch A. (iTunes User) \n\n\"This app is the best for getting to know Bible verses and if you are having a bad day then you will always have something to look at when you turn on your social networking device.\" - R110545 (iTunes User) \n\n\"I love this app! It has definitely replaced regular lock screen pictures I usually use and is also a great conversation starter when others use my phone! I hope to see even more screen options in the future!\" - Mandi4787 (iTunes User) \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\nFollow us on Instagram: @BibleLockScreens \n\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/biblelockscreens \n\nFollow on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/biblelockscreen \n\nCheck us out online: http://www.biblelockscreen.com\n\nFacebook and the Facebook logo are trademarks of Facebook, Inc.

An alarm that irritates me enough to wake up\n √ Exceptional App!! This app is super super annoying... It really gets me out of bed\n √ Love it. It's the best alarm ever\n √ Great Alarm! Been having trouble getting up. No more!\n √ This app is so easy to use, and has all the perfect functions! I'll never be late again!\n\nFEATURED IN THE MEDIA\n √ Definitely one of the more “annoying” alarms to help you get up and out of bed in the morning. – AppAdvice.com\n √ If you are the kind of person who has a difficult time waking up after you’ve turned off your alarm, this app may help keep you from being late for work. - iDownloadBlog\n\nAlso in MacWorld NL, AppsRumors, AppChronicles, etc.\n\nHOW IT WORKS \n\nAs the name \"Step Out!\" implied, the only way you can turn off this alarm clock is STEPPING out of your bed (you still can snooze - in a limited duration). It uses advanced image recognition and step tracking technologies to check whether you’re far away from your bed. \n\nAfter ringing, the app asks you to capture another photo of a specified place, it should be where you usually be every time you wake up, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, ... So you just take a photo and do your routine work like washing your face or preparing breakfast. \n\nAnother alternative is using the step counter, which simplifies this process into just nothing. You wake up and go to wherever you want with the device. After reaching enough number of steps, the alarm will automatically turn off. It’s simply a smarter alarm with no additional action., You’ll love using it from the very first time. \n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n\n- MUSIC ALARM \no Wake up with your favorite songs\no Listen to them when moving\n\n- FULLY FUNCTIONAL ALARM \no Easy setup with hand-drawn mini-game\no Repeating rule for daily, weekly alarms \no Built-in alarm sounds \no Snooze, Vibrate, Fade-in & Volume for the perfect experience \n\n- MOTION TRACKING \no Innovative motion tracking system to sense your steps\no Smart anti-cheat system to make sure that you are stepping\n\n**IMPORTANT: We do not encourage our users to step so fast when you are not totally awake, this app will just recognize the steps when you aren’t walking too fast.\n\n- IMAGE RECOGNITION\no State-of-the-art image recognizing engine\no Can match both horizontal and vertical pictures\no Strict image comparison to assure you’re leaving your bed and your eyes opened wide enough to take the right picture.\n\n**HINT: Choose a scene that has a stable light condition for better matching results.\n\n- SLEEP TIMER \no Fall asleep with music \no Auto-lock and ready for next alarm \n\n- FLASHLIGHT \no Easy to find way through the dark when you are stepping\n\n- CLOCK \no Full feature clock \no Show/hide seconds, 24 hour format, …"

      "label": "The saints, having been human,  lived every type of earthly existence and it is in the details of their life stories that we find their patronages. By invoking the saints, we ask for guidance in overcoming our own earthly trials, much like one would ask advice of a family member or friend. Meditating  on the lives of these remarkable people inspires us to conquer our own personal obstacles. \n\nA novena is a nine day period of prayer. Usually the novena prayer is recited nine times in a row for nine consecutive days, the repetitive nature of the prayer serves to bring on a quiet and meditative state. When ones mind quiets down, it allows the solution to a problem to appear or even help in the acceptance of an unchangeable life challenge.  \n\nTo help you find a saint that can aid you with your specific dilemma, we have divided this app of thirty-six saints into four categories: Health, Occupations, Situations and States of Life. You can find your saint by personally relating to their history, by being drawn to the illustrated depictions in their holy cards, or by searching the Glossary of extensive problems and life situations.\n\nOur beautiful vintage holy cards depict the saints with the enigmatic attributes and symbols that are commonly used to represent them. Brief explanations of these symbols are given to help decipher the visual iconography in their images.  The prayers in this app are universally known and have been used for centuries as tools in obtaining clarity and peace of mind. All are free to utilize them, regardless of one's faith or religious belief."

Each planet controls the hour, which belongs to it accordingly.\nEvery planet has its own individual characteristics and energy, which clearly show themselves during the associated hour.\nConsidering spheres of planetary influence, particular matters, which are implemented on certain planetary hours come out for better or for worse.\nChoose a favorable time for making your plans, while considering the planet hours, and you will stay successful and happy!"

Five Element analysis is then used to help you optimize the energy of your home or office.\n\nFeatures\n\nCreate Profiles for you and your family, friends or clients. The Profile calculates which compass sectors influence your success, health, romance and personal growth.  There are also compass sectors which bring bad luck, obstacles, illness and total loss.\n\nYour Profile is also associated with one of the Five  Elements - Earth, Fire, Metal, Water and Wood. Learn which other Elements are compatible with your Element, and which are incompatible.  Learn how to use the colors, patterns and shapes associated with these Elements to decorate your home in a way to enhance the compatible Element energies or calm the incompatible Element energies.\n\nCreate Locations for your home or office.  Double-tap in the chart area of the Location Detail screen to bring up your Photo Album and select a floor-plan for each of your floors.  To get a floor-plan into your Photo Album, you may either take a photo of the floor-plan using the iPhone's camera, or by downloading it from a website if it is available online.\n\nOnce you have selected a floor-plan image, rotate it by swiping your finger up or down, so that the north side of the floor-plan is pointing towards the bottom of the screen.  In Chinese Feng Shui, north is always positioned at the bottom of the compass rose. Swipe Left or Right to scroll between the various floors belonging to the Location.\n\nNow, you may select various Profiles to see how the chart of their beneficial and problematic compass sectors line up with the floor-plan.\n\nYou may also select the Flying Star Chart to create a  Nine Star Ki 'Natal' chart for your home or office.  Or, select a different year to see the 'Annual Stars' along with the natal stars.\n\nThe analysis and charts found on each screen may be e-mailed to your friends, family or clients so that they may share in the knowledge too!\n\nNote: One crash has been reported under OS 3.1, Will be testing to remedy this shortly.  OS 2.2 or OS 3.0 have reported no issues."

As you listen your brainwaves fall into step with this inaudible beat, and after several minutes synchronize with the target frequency. \n\nBrain Wave Altered State uses the most advanced multi-stage binaural sequences available, combined with the flexibility to choose from a range of relaxing ambient backgrounds, other audio apps, or your own iTunes Music, allowing your mind you to relax and synchronize with your desired state.  It achieves this using our unique process called Progressive Brainwave Entrainment.\n\n*** Progressive Brainwave Entrainment ***\n\nProgressive Brainwave Entrainment algorithms use layers of frequencies and carrier signals assembled in precise sequences to create profoundly unique experiences.  Each program gently brings your brainwave frequencies to your desired state using a more natural frequency progression.\n\n*** Advanced Features ***\n\n - 20 Brainwave programs each specially designed for a different situation and desired mental state.\n\n - 17 ambient background sounds to choose from.\n\n - Independently adjustable ambient sound volume.\n\n - Visual timer countdown indicator.\n\n - Automatic storage of preferred brainwave program and ambient background.\n\n - Ability to set your own custom program duration.\n\n\n* Programs Included *\n\n - Chakra Meditation:  A series of balanced, meditative brainwave programs each taking you to a different, deeper meditative state, ending in the ultimate state of meditation and calm.\n\n - Euphoric Bliss:  The ultimate brainwave program designed to gently bring your mind through a series of uplifting states, culminating in a state of euphoria and bliss.  This program will truly make your mood soar.\n\n - Lucid Beta Dreams:  This program combines elements of meditative and dreaming frequencies to create a state where you can experience waking dreams and truly escape.  Lucid dreaming is a very unique state of consciousness where you will find yourself slipping in out of dreams while remaining aware of them.\n\n - Tranquil Thoughts:  Designed simply to relax, this program progressively drops your mind into deeper states of relaxation to help you unwind and reduce stress.\n\n - Inspired Creativity:  Creates an elevated state of creativity by combining a series of focus, concentration and meditative frequencies to help you open your mind to new ideas and boost creativity.\n\n - Floating:  A unique meditative program that combines lower frequency meditative sequences with higher frequency lucid dreaming programs to create a relaxed, yet heightened state of awareness.\n\n - Quiet Mind:  Designed to help you clear your mind and empty your thoughts for a deeply relaxed state of mind.\n\n- Mindful Meditation:  Achieve a calm, centered state of mindfulness.\n\n - Other Programs:\n\n   - Morning Zen\n   - Natural High\n   - Awakened Mind\n   - Deep Reflection\n   - Astral Projection\n   - Zen Meditation\n   - High Beta Dreams\n   - Heightened Awareness\n   - Beta Meditation\n   - Gamma Meditation\n   - High Theta Meditation\n   - Full Theta Spectrum\n\nThese programs are powerful and can take effect quickly and should never be used while driving or operating machinery.

      "label": "NEWS:\nFamily Tracker was used to locate a missing child - see news report on: http://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-app-missing-idUSBRE8460GZ20120507\n\n***SUPPORT NOTICE**** \nWe do help everyone who contacts us via our iphone@logsat.com email address, but unfortunately most users give bad ratings without ever contacting us for support. Please do contact us if you have any issues, we're always there to help! \n*************** \n\nFamily Tracker allows you to track your wife, husband, children and fiancée. You can now find out where they are, at anytime, as long as they have their phones with them. Family Tracker is available for other platforms as well, so you can track (and be tracked by) other devices as well - check our website for more details. \n\nPlease note that starting with the new iOS4 and supported hardware, Family Tracker runs in the background at all times, and, unlike previous versions of Family Tracker, user intervention is **NOT** needed for you to track them. Family Tracker runs at all times, continuously updating the GPS location of the device. Even if the iPhone is rebooted, Family Tracker will automatically resume tracking and updating its position! \n\nSo how does this work? \n\nSimple. Install Family Tracker on the iPhone/iPad you want to track. From then on, you can use either a web browser or via the Family Tracker app itself installed on your own iPhone/iPad to locate your family member. \n\nIf the device you wish to track does not support multitasking (for example, older iPhones 3G, iPads), you can still use Family Tracker to locate the family member. Using the web or your own iPhone, you will be able to \"ping\" the other iPhone. This is done by sending the other iPhone a (free) “Apple Push Notification” which will cause an alert to sound on your family member’s iPhone, even if the phone in is stand-by, just as would happen if the iPhone receives an SMS. As soon as this alert is acknowledged, their GPS position will be recorded, and their location will be updated on a map. If you are using an iPhone yourself to track them, you will be sent a Push Notification to inform you that the family member has accepted your \"ping\". These notifications will be automatically re-sent every 60 seconds until they are acknowledged. If the recipient is trying to ignore them or does not hear them, this repetition will help acknowledging them. \n\nFamily Tracker does not need to know your iPhone cell number to function, as it does not send SMS messages for notifications. Your email address is instead used to send free Apple Push Notifications to the iPhones being tracked. These notifications are free, specific to our Family Tracker application, and work anywhere in the world as long as the iPhone and/or iTouch being tracked has internet access via the cellular network or WiFi. \n\nNotice: ***Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.*** For this reason, we strongly recommend users to configure Family Tracker to use the \"Driving Only\" accuracy in the GPS setting. This special mode updates the GPS location only when a significant location change occurs, which results in a tremendous gain in battery life.\n\nAdditional pro features, such as the ability to see the past locations for the previous 2 weeks, and the ability to set geofences so you are alerted when users that you track enter or leave certain areas are available via an optional iTunes subscription.\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions are available for either $1.99/month, or $5.99/3 months, or $9.99/6 months or $19.99/year. Privacy policy & terms of use: http://logsat.com/family-tracker-privacy.asp"

You select sizes with the help of our algorithm.\n2. With the help of a button you give feedback - fit or didn’t fit.\n3. Sizer teaches the sizing algorithm.\n\nShopping is no longer a lottery with Sizer.\n\n\n\"An application that remembers that last year your jeans were two sizes smaller.\"\nGQ Russia\n\n\"You could've just said \"We have Beautiful Pixels!\".

      "label": "7 Advanced Binaural Dream Induction Programs in One App!  Dream Inducer combines soothing ambient sounds with powerful binaural sequences to synchronize your brainwaves with frequencies associated with 7 different levels of dreaming. * Universal iOS App for iPhone/Pad * Headphones or Earbuds must be worn for binaural tones to be effective.\n\n* Each program includes a sleep induction phase and then introduces progressively higher frequency Alpha, Beta, and Theta dream sequences to stimulate increasingly vivid dreams.\n\n* To combine Brainwaves and Ambience with Audio from Another App use the 'Ambience + Other App' background mode.\n\n* To use just Brainwaves and Audio from Another App use the \"Other App\" option for the Background Mode.\n\n** How Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Works **\nThrough the process of brainwave entrainment human brainwave frequencies can be synchronized with a  frequency associated with a target mental state.  These Brainwave frequencies are too low for the human ear to hear, however, these low-frequencies can be perceived by the human brain if two different audible frequencies are played separately into each ear with headphones or earbuds.  For example, the human ear can't directly perceive the 2 Hz Delta-wave frequency associated with deep sleep, but if you wear headphones with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 137 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 2 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat.  As you listen, your brainwaves will begin to match that frequency, inducing the associated mental state.\n\nDream Inducer improves upon basic binaural techniques by layering multiple signals and then assembling these into sequences of programs that combine to create extremely unique experiences."

These skills help children develop a sense of self-reliance and capability that will serve them throughout their lives. \n\nYou’ll notice that none of these tools include any kind of punishment, rewards, or praise (all extrinsic motivators that research keeps showing over and over again do not work).

Not only is there artwork with each decade, but the whole layout is pleasing and lovely..”  \n    – Sarah Reinhard, catholicmom.com\n\nAdmittedly, I am my own best customer for this App and the companion iPad version (Rosary Plus HD)!  I love these prayers and images and we hope you too, will gain spiritual benefit from their use.  This is unlike any other Rosary App!\n\nWhether you are just learning or have been praying the Rosary, Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of St Michael for as many years as your teeth are old, we hope and pray you will find this App useful and beneficial for your spiritual life.\n\nAdditionally, we have found it an extremely helpful method of teaching these prayers to others.\n\nIf you have elderly parents or grandparents or visit the elderly in Nursing Homes or Assisted Living Facilities, consider praying this App with them while meditating on each of the scriptural references included, and their images.     We were surprised how quickly and easily it was in teaching a child to pray the Rosary or Chaplets for the first time using this beautifully designed App!  \n\nAnd most of these prayers are among the most important prayers of The Church Militant!\n\nWe have designed this App to be used frequently, therefore, we used the popular TabView for that specific purpose; that being, when you are praying the repetitive prayers you can easily tap the Main or other view buttons and meditate on either of the images included.  \n\nThe Rosary and Chaplets views both provide you with a convenient \"tap-the-bead\" method of praying on each of the views.  Rosary and Divine Mercy Chaplet, Opening and Closing prayers are available at a tap, and you can show or hide prayers as needed.  Completing a mystery or decade and advancing to the next...a tap and the view is reset and ready for you to continue through all five decades.  There are numerous other features included that we hope you will discover and will love! \n\n As always if you love our work please tell all your family and friends, if you don't please tell us.\n\nIN Christ\n+JMJ\nSt Clement ePress"

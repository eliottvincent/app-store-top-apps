This app is perfectly dialed in so that keys fade out and in with no overlap. Also great for practicing vocally or instrumentally at home."

This is a full featured complete SDA eHymnal lyrics that are ultra sharp and clear. Contains all of the 695 hymns from the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal® plus many more from the \"old\" hymnal and other choruses. Also has all of the responsive readings. No internet connection is needed to use this hymnal after installation. \n\nThe user interface has a clean look with no ads, and very easy to use. You can quickly and easily find the hymn that you want either by selecting from the alphabetical index of hymn titles and first lines, the numerical index of hymn numbers based on the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal®, or your own bookmark list. There is a full featured bookmark list for you to add songs that you need for quick access. Use the search feature to quickly search for words in the title or first line, or just enter a hymn number to jump directly to that hymn. You can also swipe left or right to go to the next or previous song just like turning pages in the printed hymnal. But what is even better is that the swipe turning sequence can either be in numerical hymn number order, alphabetical hymn title order, or bookmark list order. Zoom in for larger texts both in portrait or landscape orientations. \n\nGod has given me two talents-music and computer. I have been a church pianist and organist for several decades, and professionally, I am a computer professor. So putting these two talents together, I have personally written this app to be a blessing to others. I hope that you will like it and be blessed by it. I would love to hear from you to tell me how I can improve this app. \n\nThis app is neither endorsed by nor affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church®. \n\nPlease email support@mygadgets2.com if you have any problems whatsoever in using this app."

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

The idea was to design a tool to manipulate a melody’s speed, direction, and pitch, as well as play multiple variations of the melody simultaneously.\n\nAs it turned out, the best implementation for this was to reimagine one of the most fundamental building blocks of all music sequencers: the piano roll.\n\nFUGUE MACHINE is the world’s first multi-playhead piano roll. Create a music sequence and play it back with up to four playheads at once — each at various speeds, directions, pitches, and more. Watch the playheads dance, and hear the complex patterns that emerge.\n\nIt’s mesmerizing.\n\nFugue Machine supports iPhone, iPad, MIDI, AUv3 MIDI, Ableton Link, Audiobus, Audiobus 3 MIDI, and Inter-App Audio."

      "label": "Controlling the dynamics of your parts and recordings is an essential step towards a professional sounding mix. With BLEASS Compressor’s powerful performance and intuitive user interface, such pro-grade dynamics control has never been easier.\r\n\r\nBLEASS Compressor’s flexible dynamics engine makes it an ideal choice in many different situations. With compression ratios of up-to 60:1, a variable knee, and flexible attack and release stages, BLEASS Compressor can deliver a wide range of different response characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe plug-in’s flexibility is further enhanced by a powerful dual filter that operates on the analysed signal, providing both low-pass and high-pass filtering. The filters work on both internal and sidechain signals, and are resonant too, making it easy to create dynamics effects that are highly frequency dependant.\r\n\r\nDespite its versatility and power, BLEASS Compressor is simple to setup and work with. Compression and filter curves are set using tactile graphical widgets, whilst you receive constant easy-to-read visual feedback about how the plugin is operating.\r\n\r\nPerhaps best of all, BLEASS Compressor is ultra-efficient, so you can include its intuitive dynamics control to any-and-every part that needs it.\r\n\r\nAlso available for Desktop (VST3 / AU / AAX)\r\n\r\nTech specs, tutorials and more info available on https://www.bleass.com/compressor/"

      "label": "Chorus D is an audio unit effect inspired by a well-loved classic chorus stomp-box. \n\nHOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CHORUS EFFECTS?\n\nIt's more subtle. It has a stereo pair of pitch-shifters, one shifts up and the other down. Every few seconds, the two pitch shifters trade places: the high one goes low and the low one goes high. Unlike most other chorus effects, the pitch-shift amounts stay constant rather than oscillating up and down.  For that reason, you don't hear the wavy pitch sound that other chorus effects make.  At low settings, you can put it on a track to widen the stereo image or thicken up the sound and listeners may not be able to identify that they are hearing a chorus effect.\n\n\nWHY ONLY SIX BUTTONS?\n\nThe original hardware that inspired this design had only four buttons and four presets, one for each button.* The simplicity of the controls is one of the reasons the effect was so well-liked: all four presets sounded great. With six buttons you get tones ranging from very subtle to clearly audible, and all of them are tasteful and useful. This effect makes only one type of sound but it's a unique sound that you don't get from other chorus effects.\n\n\nIS THIS AN EXACT CIRCUIT MODEL OF THE ORIGINAL HARDWARE EFFECT?\n\nNo. We listened to the original and studied its design but then we built an effect to please our own ears. It sounds similar to the original but the design is unique.\n\n************************************\nNote: this is an audio unit plugin. It does not process audio as a standalone app.\n\n*Later on customers figured out that they could get some other settings by pressing two buttons simultaneously or forcing all the buttons off. We are using six buttons to get wider variety of sounds rather than expecting customers to discover those secret features of the original hardware."

Silo combines microscopic granulation with macroscopic reverb tails to extract new realms from your existing sounds.\n\nSilo's first section, the granulator, breaks the incoming signal to tiny little bits (called \"grains\") before reconstructing it with massive amounts of control. You can change the speed and pitch of the signal independently and in real-time!\n\nThese grains are then sent to Silo's unique spatializer, which throws the grains all over the stereo field. The spatializer contains a number of motion algorithms to add trajectory to your grains, such as the orbital \"Moons\", the shooting \"Meteors\", or the squirmy \"Biological\". After using this spatializer, you'll never want to use a traditional auto-panner ever again.\n\nFinally, the signal washes through one of Silo's many reverb algorithms, from small, resonant spaces to enormous, booming voids. From \"Bokeh\" to \"Nebula\", each mode can be tweaked to frame your sound perfectly.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Silo has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Silo can be used on tablets and phones with ease."

      "label": "Grand Finale has been given some much needed love and attention resulting in a major face lift and a some extra horse power under the hood - resulting in Grand Finale 2!  The iOS app now has custom interfaces for iPhone and iPad, and it works both as standalone and as an AUv3 plugin.\n\nGrand Finale 2 is a multi effect audio processing application designed for finalizing complete mixes, stems, voice overs, buses and/or individual audio tracks. The plug-in offers several modules in a pre-routed configuration. Each module has parameters to alter, and most modules offer a set of algorithms to select. These features come together to make Grand Finale a powerful tool for quickly finalizing a track, bus or mix.\n\nUsage:\n\nImport audio files, or extract from a video in the camera roll. Audio can also be imported by using the “Open In..” option in any other app that can export audio.\nUse the playback controls to start and stop playing, and alter the module knobs/options to change how the audio is processed. When satisfied with the result, tap Export to render and save the finalized audio file.\n\nIncluded DSP Modules:\n\nMain bus processing\n\n   • High Pass filter\n\n   • Compressor\n\n   • Multiband Compressor\n\n   • MS Stereo Tool\n\n   • Equalizer\n\n   • Limiter\n\nAdditive/parallel processing\n\n   • Compressor\n\n   • Distortion\n\n\nOther features:\n\n   • Accurate RMS and LUFS metering (tap the meters to swap)\n\n   • 37 professionally made factory presets.\n\n   • Load / Save custom user presets\n\n   • Project manager (load / save full state including audio file data)\n\n   • User manual bundled inside app.\n\n   • Parallel processing is phase linear.\n\n   • Exports to WAV/AIFF/AAC at 16, 24 or 32 bits (sample rate is preserved)\n\n\nListening examples (pre/post) available here: https://soundcloud.com/klevgrandproducts/sets/grand-finale-audio-examples\n \nSaid about Grand Finale:\n\n“The magic behind this plugin is the compressor on the bottom portion, the stereo processor and the incredible EQ section. The bass and treble EQ (in default mode) is the best I've heard by far in a plugin.“ - Robbie Soukiasyan (Skrillex, Tiesto, Usher and more..)\n\n“...and Grand Finale is a genuinely impressive processor for not only the master output, but also mix busses and even individual tracks…” - Computer Music Magazine (CM254)\n\n“Overall, we are impressed by Grand Finale. The plug-in is well thought out and has a very modern, sleek user interface that doesn’t compromise on intuitiveness, metering, or other relevant information and features. Such things help with standing out in the crowded mastering/finalization plug-ins market.” - Gearnews.com"

      "label": "\"LO‑FI‑AF is a very capable lo‑fi toolkit capable of surgically targeted destruction and it could easily find applications in just about any musical genre\" -SoundOnSound\n\nUnfiltered Audio's lo-fi-af is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nlo-fi-af takes your sound on a journey of artifacts and noise throughout recorded history, from tape warbles and vinyl noise to MP3 chirps and cell phone speaker chatter. lo-fi-af's many sections and versatile algorithms can place your sound in a different decade, or give it a thoroughly modern spin through compound processing.\n\nThe first section is a convolution reverb preloaded with impulse responses from broken microphones, toy speakers, cell phones, and more. With this section alone, you can place your sound into an entirely different space.\n\nThe Spectral section then splits your sound into thousands of frequencies before reconstructing it with a twist. Here you can reproduce the sound of a pirated MP3 or pitch shift your signal with clean perfection.\n\nYour signal then takes a trip through the digital section. All sorts of hazards are present here, from a skipping CD stutter effect to a multimode bitcrusher.\n\nFinally, the rich, colorful analog section adds that vibe that you crave. A maximizer, a tape saturator, a noise generator, an analog-style filter, a pitch warbler, and a radio demodulator all work together in harmony to toss your sound into the past.\n\nBut wait! That's only one possible signal chain. The Convolution, Spectral, Digital, and Analog sections can be completely rearranged in any order. Dozens of presets will get your started on your sound warping adventure.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, lo-fi-af has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, lo-fi-af can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with lo-fi-af will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

      "label": "VintageRack is a minimalistic and convenient multi-effect application that contains modules realistically simulating notable retro gear from the early digital age with their natural lo-fi and warm aesthetics. Most of the effects in this application have been inspired and based on the principles of actual hardware from the 70s and 80s, which is great for giving the sound of any instrument the nostalgic and emotional mood of old recordings.\n\nThis application has a clean and intuitive user interface with a well-considered structure. All controls are located on the main screen, which is divided into seven slots for processing (effect) modules. The first slot contains the module for controlling the input, the last one is for controlling the output. Each of the five slots in between are designed to use one of the effect modules. The input signal passes from the first to the last slot and is then sent to the output.\n\nEach slot has a Master Fader that controls the presence of the effect, and a Mute button that smoothly turns the effect on and off. These controls are available to be assigned to a MIDI controller, or to use as audio unit parameters regardless of the type of module in the slot. Also in each slot, there is a Parameters button that opens a panel of additional parameters for each module. Additional parameters of modules are kept to a minimum and represent the most suitable use cases.\n\nThe key idea behind application control is to first adjust the parameters of modules, and then use only the Master Fader to change the presence or depth of the effect and the Mute button to turn it on and off. Everything is geared towards fast and easy use.\n\nAnother great feature of VintageRack is the ability to set a lower bit depth of processed signal, typical for early digital devices, both for the entire path and for individual modules. As with these devices, this application simulates pre- and post-processing of the analog signal both before and after the digital circuits with the addition of companders, emphasis and filters, which makes the sound similar to the real devices.\n\nEffect modules: \n\n- Analog-style compressor.\n- Three band equalizer typical for mixing consoles.\n- Classic and reverse delays with modulation feature.\n- Two modules of Chorus simulating two well known devices.\n- Two modules of Flanger with different options and tones.\n- Two modules of Phaser with various sound character.\n- Filter module controlled by LFO or envelope generator.\n- Simulation of classic Wah effects with automation.\n- Combined effect of Tremolo and Vibrato with separate rate.\n- Ring modulator with additional modulation of carrier.\n- Three types of Fuzz with modulated filters.\n- Simulation of one of the early digital reverbs.\n- Vintage exciter with bass enhancer.\n- Spring reverb with tube preamp.\n- Advanced formant filter with voice synth mode.\n- Input slot contains Noise gate and Automatic gain control.\n- Output slot contains tape-style saturation and tonestacks.\n\nVintageRack is a universal application for iOS and macOS. It can work on iPhone and iPad as well as Mac / MacBook with M1 chip (and later). VintageRack works on iPhone and iPad standalone, as an Audio Unit or Inter-App Audio module, and supports Audiobus and Ableton Link. On MacOS, VintageRack can works both as a standalone application and as an Audio unit (AUv3) with DAWs and audio unit hosts like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, GarageBand, MainStage, Cockos Reaper, Plogue Bidule, Hosting AU, and other hosts that support AUv3 plugins. All application features are available on iOS and macOS, including MIDI support (with a MIDI learn option) and audio unit parameters. VintageRack has a built-in detailed description of all parameters also available as PDF file on the application site.\n\nPresets demo:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/I3lcd5rYaBQ\nhttps://youtu.be/zmHjpFDkPLQ\n\nYou can find more information on VintageRack and other experimental audio processing apps at: \n\nhttps://motion-soundscape.blogspot.com"

      "label": "With its blend of wavetable and classic subtractive oscillators, flexible filtering and post-processing, and an extensive set of advanced modulation sources, BLEASS Megalit provides sound designers with a vast palette of timbral tints, shades and colours to explore. And, thanks to BLEASS’ super-intuitive interface design, that entire sonic palette is within easy reach of even the most non-technical of musicians.\n\nMegalit includes many innovations that will empower your sound designs:\n- Advanced wavetable oscillators can adjust both wavetable position and fold, bringing near-infinite variety to each of the synth’s 130+ wavetables;\n- Per-oscillator unison mode allows you to create complex layering that would normally require you to load additional synths into your project;\n- Noise generator with dedicated high- and low-pass filtering for super-flexible non-tonal sounds and sound components.\n- Resonant high-pass and low-pass filters that can be applied to individual oscillators or pairs of oscillators, as can the built-in waveshaper and bit-crusher processors;\n- Four LFOs, each with its own timing curve and output smoothing, that allow for the creation of exceptionally complex – not to mention original – modulation patterns;\n- Advanced Motion Sequencer for the creation of complex repeating modulation patterns;\n- Per-patch storage of performance controller response curves ensure a sound will always respond the way you expect it to;\n- Patch randomising feature always produces useable sounds;\n- Built-in multi-band upward/downward compressor provides exquisite control over a sound’s dynamics and punchiness.\n\nAll of Megalit’s parameters, settings and controls, no matter how advanced, are laid out at your fingertips, with intuitive visual feedback ensuring you always know exactly what the synth is doing. And, despite its huge sonic power, Megalit is super-efficient on your system, leaving you with plenty of headroom for running additional instruments and effects… or, better still, more instances of Megalit!\n\n\nBLEASS Megalit is available as an AUv3 plugin or standalone App.\nBLEASS Megalit is also available for Window & Mac Users.\nMore information available on https://www.bleass.com/megalit"

      "label": "If you think FM Synthesis is complicated, it’s time to think again!\n\nBLEASS Omega places all of the sparkle, character, nuance and dynamic expressiveness of FM Synthesis at your fingertips, and does away with the arcane programming interfaces so often associated with FM. Harnessing BLEASS’ signature GUI technology, creating and crafting sounds in Omega is not just easier than with other FM synths, it’s easy – PERIOD!\n\nAll of the classic capabilities of FM Synthesis are available in BLEASS Omega – expressive electric pianos, deep thundering basses, crystal-clear pads, sparkling bells, and soulful leads. And thanks to the instrument’s analogue-style Waveshaper and multi-mode Filter, BLEASS Omega can inject powerful analogue-like flavour into those pure FM tones, giving searing filter sweeps, growling distortions, and harmonically-rich resonances.\n\nThe four FM operators that sit at the heart of BLEASS Omega are edited simultaneously from within a single screen, with all operator envelopes and controls available to the touch of your finger. This amazingly user-friendly approach makes light work of sound editing, and encourages experimentation and exploration in a way no other FM synth can achieve. \n\nWith eleven FM algorithms on offer, each providing a different way of interconnecting the four operators for radically different results, the sonic scope of BLEASS Omega is vast. The included library of over 200 professionally designed presets makes full use of this versatility, furnishing you with a varied and inspirational sound palette to use in your music making and sound design projects.\n\nBLEASS Omega fits in with your workflow and studio setup, no matter how you like to create. The iOS edition provides both standalone and AUv3 versions for use on iPad and iPhone, whilst the desktop edition for Windows and macOS comes as a VST3/AU plugin instrument, compatible with all major DAWs.\n\nMore information, tutorials and specifications on https://www.bleass.com/omega/"

      "label": "BeatCutter is an experimental multi-channel application for slicing and recombining sound based on rhythm. In the center of the application is a matrix of sample cells with smoothly reconfigurable recording, playback and control busses. This application is best for those who would like to experiment with large audio files or live instruments, creating chaotic constructions and patterns from sliced rhythm-driven samples.\n\nWith BeatCutter you can create sound textures and abstractions with the atmosphere of cyberpunk, industrial ambience or alien jungle. This application has an almost unlimited range of options for transformation of source audio. The kind of original sound does not really matter. It can be any tracks, external musical instruments or sound from other applications. The content of the source material and your settings will define the final result, which can range from futuristic IDM to abstract music for fill the living space and soundscapes for relaxation and meditation.\n\nPlease note that BeatCutter does not contain exact presets for a specific result. It has a large set of parameters that are adjusted by experiment depending on the source material. But for a quick start and search for ideas, this application has a convenient template editor, which consists of a set of numbers, where each number defines values for a group of parameters. You can change numbers in the template and listen to the result, or use the randomizer for the entire template, then change some specific parameters and save the current state as a preset.\n\nOne of the most interesting and experimental features of this application is the feedback mode. This is not like analog feedback when positive loop gain occurs at some more or less stable resonant frequency. It looks more like fractals when the next level is similar to the whole structure, but in this case with constantly changes. We can say that it works like a sound structure that evolves and changes itself. This is an incredible ability to create perfect sound abstractions, unrelated to any external samples or signals and it opens up a huge potential for experimentation and inspiration.\n\nBeatCutter supports up to 4 external input and output channels, playback up to 8 files at once, works as a multi-channel audio unit. With DAWs and hosts, you can use this application as an effect plugin. The application interface is designed for convenient work with the most common MIDI controllers containing 8 faders and 8 knobs.\n\nBeatCutter is a universal application for iOS and macOS. It can work on iPhone and iPad as well as Mac / MacBook with M1 chip (and later). BeatCutter works on iPhone and iPad standalone, as an Audio Unit or Inter-App Audio module, and supports Audiobus and Ableton Link. On macOS, BeatCutter can works both as a standalone application and as an Audio unit with DAWs and audio unit hosts like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, GarageBand, MainStage, Cockos Reaper, Plogue Bidule, Hosting AU, and other hosts that support AUv3 plugins. All application features are available on iOS and macOS, including MIDI support (with a midi learn option), audio unit parameters and importing samples from any directory on device. BeatCutter has a built-in detailed description of all parameters also available as PDF file on application site.\n\nQuick start demo:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nhwOK4tXFvQ\nhttps://youtu.be/_OekZzgAmCw\nhttps://youtu.be/Kt5rb8KtNs4\nhttps://youtu.be/89H4l-0Es70\n\nYou can find more information on BeatCutter and other experimental and audio processing applications at:\n\nhttps://motion-soundscape.blogspot.com"

      "label": "NuRack is an AUv3 based multi-channel audio and MIDI effects processor with a difference, it actually allows you to design your own custom effects using the 80+ building blocks provided. You have full control over routing which allows you to create complex audio paths in series or parallel. You can choose whether to use the stock interface or create your own custom interface using the built in Interface Builder which allows you to concentrate your audio components into a single customized effect.\n\nNuRack can run in one of two modes. The first providing 3 customizable effects racks which can be switched (manually or via MIDI),  providing seemless switching (i.e. delay trails linger whilst another set of effects are faded in). The second mode allows you to route audio through 3 independent audio racks.\n\nA generaous number of over 80 audio and midi building blocks are provided covering 12 different categories of effects. Here are just some of those included in NuRack:\n\nModulation Effects: Chorus, Flanger, Phaser, Tremolo, Vocal Doubler,  TalkBox, UniVibe, Leslie & Vocoder.\n\nTime Based Effects: Stereo Delay, Tape Delay, Reverb and Reverse Delay.\n\nSpectral Effects: Parametric EQ, Graphic EQ, PitchShift, Auto-Pan, Bit-Crusher, Tube Overdrive, Distortion, Harmony, Harmonic Exciter and SlowMo.\n\nDynamic Effects: VelocityControl, Compressor, Multi-Band Compressor, Noise Gate, Gate, and Limiter.\n\nFilter Effects: MultiFilter, LP/HP Filter, Frequency Splitter, MultiBand Splitter, Classic Filters, Formant Filter, Ring Modulation and Shelf Filter.\n\nMIDI Effects: MIDI Harmony, MIDI Velocity, MIDI Randomizer, MIDI Monitor, MIDI Mixer, MIDI Pads, MIDI Control, Strummer, MIDI Recorder, MIDI Modulation, MIDI Remap, CC Monitor,  CC Generator, PitchBend, MIDI Time Clock, and ChordToMidi.\n\nGenerator Modules: Noise, Audio Clip Launcher, SoundFont Player, Virtual Flute, Virtual Clarinet, Virtual Brass, FM Organ, FM Rhodes and Analog Sawtooth Synth.\n\nAutomation: TouchPad, AutoMate, Pattern Automation, and Visual LFO.\n\nYou also provide the ability to split and combine audio signal using splitters and mixer modules as well as a number of visual elements such as VU Meters, LED Meters, Scopes, Graphs etc.\n\nSome effects such as phaser and flanger are usually controlled by an LFO, but this can be detached and automated remotely. There are a number of modules that allow auomation based on direct touch (X/Y Pads), Visual LFO, Pattern Automation, MIDI input (CC data), or peak/rms level detection. These automation modules can remotely control knobs and sliders throughout your rack.\n \nSimply create a new rack and start adding modules to it. These modules are generally wired up automatically but these connections can be manually routed. Once you have your sound as you wish you can use it 'as is', or switch to Interface Builder mode where you can combine all your modules into a single interface. Elements can be dragged, dropped, resized and coloured as required. Add your own labels, image logos and custom backgrounds before saving your custom component.\n\nUse the X/Y Pad to control your modulation effects by detaching their LFO's. Use MIDI CC data to automate knobs. Use the velocity of an incoming signal to control the cutoff/resonance of a filter (wah) or volume level of a gain control (swell),  as NuRack expands, so do the possibilities.\n\nFeatures:\n\n○ Over 80 categorised modules.\n○ 3 Input / Output busses supported.\n○ Audio & MIDI effect.\n○ Lots of audio & MIDI automation options.\n○ Seemless transition between racks.\n○ Manual audio path routing.\n○ Open in presentation mode (auto hides controls).\n○ Interface Builder to customize your rack.\n○ AUv3 plugin runs in MIDI and none MIDI mode.\n○ Add your own Text/Heading and Image/Logos and backgrounds to your design.\n○ Compatibility options for DAW's not supporting multi-channels.\n○ Dark/Light Modes\n\nCheckout the YouTube channel 'Paul the MusicMan' for demos and tutorials of NuRack."

All 16 bands can be panned separately, so this method is quite equal to the “split EQ” function often found on various well-rounded equalizers.\n\n• MS Stereo – controls the output stereo width on each band, from normal stereo signal to mono.\n\nThere’s also a view for controlling the output gain of all bands separately.\n\n\nNew features from version 2.0 and later:\n\n• New and more transparent crossover filters\n• Haas: Better control for each band\n• Split EQ is now called \"PAN\" and provides much more control\n• MS Stereo\n• Gain\n• Visualization\n• Brand new and more intuitive UI for a better work flow.\n• Several factory presets.\n\nFull documentation available inside the app or at https://klevgrand.se/downloads/haaze-docs/\n\nAudio examples and more info at https://klevgrand.se/products/haaze\n\nHaaze 2 works both as a standalone app and as an AUv3 plugin."

      "label": "Classic FX application is a complete sound effects processor and a mono to stereo enhancer with equalizer, effects and reverb, based on specially designed high-quality processing algorithms and suitable for any kind of audio sources. Classic FX will add brightness and expand the sound space of any musical instruments, synthesizers, drums or voice. Unique and varied effects with unified control parameters provide convenience and ease setup, while at the same time many opportunities for individual expression and experimentation.\n\nEach effect called “Algorithm” is based on a combination of classic effects, such as echo, rotary speaker, autowah, autopan, chorus, flanger, distortion, filters, and is almost like a separate application with its own distinctive sonic signature, which you can vary from subtle to very noticeable.\n\nComplex and integrated effects sound much more varied and interesting than simple effect modules, and will give you the opportunity not to waste time looking for combinations of single effects, but to start creative work with the sound of your instruments right away.\n\nAnother unique feature of this application is the Morphing option, based on a complex transformation of effect matrices, which allows you to control the dynamic transition between any two effects. While this can produce mind-boggling effects, it couldn't be easier to control - you just need to move the fader or push a button. For more experiments with morphing this application has three linked LFOs to create more complex waveforms to modify the morphing. Each LFO has different ranges, waveforms and can sync with the main BPM. You can see the final waveform of all LFOs on the graph at different scales.\n\nSome of the other exciting features of Classic FX are:\n\n- Classic FX has 22 unique processing algorithms and 40 different presets.\n- Two slots in which you can use different effects and smoothly morph between them.\n- Three band equalizer with high / low shelving filters and middle peaking filter.\n- Easy to use algorithmic reverb, suitable for any sound source.\n- Limiter on output prevents any possible clipping.\n- Envelope follower for dynamic control of each effect.\n- Sequencer for rhythmic control of each effect.\n- Three special LFO in series to automate morphing.\n- Hot buttons to change the active effect slot.\n- Changing a group of parameters at the same time.\n- Echo module, Sequencer, and Auto morphing synced with the main BPM source.\n- The effect algorithm and its parameters can be saved as a preset.\n- Detailed application description and description of algorithms.\n- Quick info and description of the algorithm used in presets.\n- Universal application for iPad and iPhone.\n- Supports Standalone, AUv3, Inter-App audio, Audiobus.\n- All parameters of equalizer, effects and reverb accessible for AUv3 host.\n- Supports Ableton Link with sync tempo and start / stop.\n\nOverview:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCNTTwbEnBg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyiKOAM7pjQ\n\nYou can find more information about Classic FX and other sound processing and experimental applications on the site:\n\nhttps://motion-soundscape.blogspot.com"

      "label": "Inspired by the vintage analogue filters found on the world’s most renowned classic synths, and wrapped in our trademark super-modern interface design, BLEASS Filter delivers a great sound along with an intuitive and tactile user experience. The plugin also provides detailed visual feedback that can be read and understood at a glance.\n\nA static filter can be as dull as no filter at all, which is why we have included both an envelope follower and an LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) in BLEASS Filter. The envelope follower can be tuned to perfectly match your audio, adding dynamic interest to your music, whilst the LFO creates repeating sweeps and movement that can run freely or sync to the beat.\n\nWith superb versatility, ultra-efficient processing, and a great price, BLEASS Filter is guaranteed to bring new character and interest to your audio, and a smile to your face!\n\nUSING BLEASS FILTER\n\n___INPUT SECTION\nGain\nSets the volume of the incoming signal. This also impacts on the sensitivity of the envelope follower.\n\nSens\nControls the sensitivity of the envelope follower. This works in conjunction with the Gain setting to determine when, and host strongly, a new envelope cycle will be triggered. \n\nAttack\nDetermines how quickly the envelope responds to peaks and transients\n\nRelease\nDetermines how quickly the envelope closes after the attack phase is complete.\n\nEnvelope\nControls the strength and polarity of the envelope’s impact on the filter’s cutoff frequency. Positive settings cause the envelope to increase the filter’s cutoff frequency, whilst negative settings will reduce the cutoff.\n\nMeter\nVisualises the activity of the envelope follower, making it easier to understand how it is responding to the input signal. \n\n___FILTER SECTION\n\nFilter Graph\nThe large on-screen graph gives an accurate readout of the filter’s current setup, and also allows you to change that setup: drag left and right to alter the cutoff frequency; drag up-and-down to increase or decrease the filter resonance.\n\nMode selection buttons\nBLEASS Filter’s versatile multi-mode design offers a choice of low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and notch filtering.\n\nX2 Button \nDoubles-up the filter, accentuating the resonant frequencies and creating a sharper cutoff slope or, in the case of the notch filter, a wider notch.\n\n___LFO SECTION\n\nSync\nChose between a free-running LFO, or one that is synced to the beat of your host DAW.\n\nWaveform\nSelect the shape of the LFO. From top to bottom: sine, triangle, saw-tooth up, saw-tooth down, square, and sample-and-hold.\n\nRate\nWhen running in FREE sync mode, sets the length of one LFO cycle in terms of seconds, from 16 seconds down to 50 milliseconds.\n\nSync Rate\nWhen running in BEAT sync mode, sets the the length of one LFO cycle in terms of beat-and-note length, from 4 bars down to 1/32 note (that is, a demisemiquaver).\n\nOffset\nWhen running in BEAT sync mode, offsets the LFO’s phase, or starting point, in relation to the beat.\n\nStereo\nCreates a phase offset between left and right channels of the LFO signal. At ±100%, the channels are fully offset, with one channel hitting its maximum value when the other reaches its minimum. At 0% the two channels remain locked together.\n\nAmount\nDetermines how strongly the LFO signal impacts on the filter’s cutoff frequency.\n\nMeter\nThe two-part bar meter provides an intuitive visualisation of how strongly the LFO is impacting on the filter’s cutoff frequency.\n\n___MIX\n\nGain\nSet the master output level of the plugin. Large resonance settings can result in particularly strong peaks, which can be tamed here.\n\nDry/Wet\nSets the balance between ‘dry’ input signal and ‘wet’ filtered signal. A setting of 100% means only the filtered signal will be heard.\n\n___\n\nBLEASS Filter is also available for Desktop\nvisit www.bleass.com for more information"

Switch between two different filter types: \n- the Low-Shelf filter can reduce or boost your basses.\n- the High-Pass filter cuts the low part of the signal and creates a resonant peak on interesting frequencies.\n\n2/ The second stage offers a unique-sounding reverb with size modulation and length controls. It also contains a high frequency damping control in order to re-create plate reverb effects, as well as a freeze toggle button for infinite sound soaring and exploration.\nThis reverb offers also an X/Y panel which applies a set of fine-tuned frequency shifter as well as a wave shaper in order to mutate your reverb space on the go!\n\n3/ The third stage offers a duck effect made of a compressor side-chained on the dry input in order to bring clarity to heavy kicks and basses\n\nFinally, a dry-wet controller offers control over the reverb level. \n\nAll these features are shown within the factory presets, and you can save your own presets which will automatically carry over across different host apps. \nAll variables are exposed as AU parameters in hosts which support automation. \nBLEASS reverb can also be used as a standalone app using headphones and mic or an external sound card.\n\nCheck out www.bleass.com for video tutorials and demos!\n\n*** NOTE : this is an Audio Unit Effect Plugin (AUv3) which ideally requires a compatible host (such as AUM or Audiobus) or DAW (such as GarageBand or Cubasis) ***"

      "label": "A true powerhouse of audio warfare, Grind puts the \"damage\" in Audio Damage. From subtle tube-style saturation to full-on mangled wavetable distortion, Grind is a Swiss Army Knife of sound design. This effect consists of three main blocks: wavetable lookup, in to algorithmic saturation/distortion/, and finally to a multi-mode filter with eleven different topologies, from your favorite four-pole lowpass ladder filter, to the 18dB screaming acid, to more subtle toolbox filters like notch. Driving it all is a tempo-synced LFO for rhythmic filtering and grinding. \n\nGrind is code-identical to our VST/AU/AAX version, and can even load its presets. Take your favorite destruction plug on the road with you in this AudioUnits v3 version. Also includes a stand-alone app.\n\nFEATURES\n\n> Input gain and gate \n\n> Wavetable lookup distortion module with LFO modulation over 15 wavetables, and control over window size and phase. This replaces the input sample with one chosen from the selected wavetable based on input level. \n\n> Algorithmic distortion module. Apply one of eleven different distortion/saturation algorithms to the signal, for everything from subtle tube-style harmonic saturation to full sine driver craziness.\n\n> Multi-mode filter with eleven different topologies, from popular vintage synth filters to studio carving tools. The filter frequency is an LFO modulation target, making this worth the price of admission for the filter alone. \n\n> Tempo-synced LFO. In an AUv3 host, Grind's LFO automatically syncs to your host, and can provide rhythmic interest to virtually any track. Mod the filter, for timbral interest, or mod the wavetable, for the full Grind destructo-effect! \n\n> A mix control rounds out this easy-to-use, yet deceptively intense effect. Add a little or add it all, Grind is a multi-effect that will bring any sound to life."

A GPU-powered, fast and advanced integrated editor is part of TouchOSC on all platforms - create the most complex of control layouts with ease and precision.\n\nMIDI, OSC and more...\n\nTouchOSC supports sending and receiving any number of MIDI and OSC messages on many connections simultaneously. On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com. I may be able to fix your issue in less time than it would take to write a negative review!"

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever.

It is however possible to edit a single-track tablature with the NotePad tool and export your work into .gpx and .gp formats to finish your composition in Guitar Pro 6 or 7. Editing a drum track is not available with the NotePad tool."

Use the StereoEQ setting for that)\n+ Select from over 10 presets or save your own. You can even share them via email and import presets from other people via email.\n+ Full background support including remote control (from docks, headsets, car stereos)\n+ Visualize the music with the spectrum analyzer.\n+ Use AirPlay to listen on your AppleTV, or your Bluetooth headsets and even a dock. \n+ Use the pre-amp slider to adjust the overall boost or cut. Make sure to turn the slider down if you experience distortion. Use the auto-normalizer function to prevent clipping automatically and have the best dynamic range possible with your eq curve. (on/off in settings)\n+ Curve screen: curve redraws as controllers are dragged. Pinch to modify Q. Three stage clipping signal on preamp slider. Keyboard entry for pre-amp. Twitter/Facebook/Weibo integration to share your current EQ curve. Bypass.\n+ Crossfade between songs. Make sure to stop the music before changing the crossfade time slider.\n+ Now playing screen includes repeat (all, single no repeat) button and shuffles like the music app. Improved stability of on the fly modifications of the playlist. Add more songs to the playlist at any time. Sort playlist alphabetically.\n+ Music selection is very similar to default music app.\n+ Turn landscape to display the frequency analyzer. \n+ Built in sleep timer to stop Equalizer after a certain period if time. \n+ Crossfeed option to blend audio between channels\n+ Apple Watch support for eq curve selection incl. complications\n\nKNOWN ISSUES:\nNo known issues. please contact support if you have any problems.\n\nCOPY-PROTECTED MUSIC:\nEqualizer will not play copy-protected (DRM). You need to convert DRM songs. Apple Music Streaming uses copy-protected songs.\n\niCLOUD:\nOnly the Apple Music app can manage songs in iCloud (iTunes Match). You will need to make sure the songs are downloaded to your device to listen and enhance them via Equalizer. If you want to stream and eq your music, you can try our other app: CloudEQ. It allows you to stream and eq music from SoundCloud and your Dropbox account without the need for storage on your device.\n\nFrom the reviews:\n\nEXCELLENT PROGRAM\nI connect my iphone 4 to a car audio system, with the application the music began to sound incomparably better ....\nA little clear interface, but to understand it and understand need no more than 5-10 minutes. -- P_S_B_\n***\nLOVE IT\nThis is the EQ I have been looking for, and because of bad ratings I almost passed on it! I consider myself an aspiring audiophile and have the equipment -- Klipsch, Sunfire, Nottingham, Denon, Paradigim, etc. -- (and debt) to back it up. This EQ performs flawlessly and is very easy to use. It enhanced my music dramatically. Yes, dramatically! Just make sure you are running the recommended IOS, as the developer suggests. -- J. Paul DiMaggio\n***\n\n\nPLEASE if you have concerns or encounter problems with the app: post on http://www.audioforge.ca and we will explain how things work, until you can use all the features of the app to the fullest. Thank you"

      "label": "You wish you could play any video file on your iPhone/iPad, no matter its format?  that's why we made GPlayer.\n\n@ZDNET: GPlayer fills the iOS void left by VLC!\n\n* Follow our Twitter @GinkgoTech to get the free code when new version released.\n \n* GPlayer was honored as \"app of the Week\" in the Appcast.\n\n* Supported File Format Extension \n\n- AVI(without packet-b frame), WMV, RMVB, ASF, H264, MKV, TS, M2TS... most of all movie file formats.\n- MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG, FLAC... most of all audio file formats.\n- SMI, ASS, SUB, SRT, TXT... most of all subtitle file formats. [build in subtitle is also supported]\n\n* Extra Features\n\n- USB Sync: Use itunes to fast sync movies to GPlayer.\n- WIFI Upload: Upload movie even you don't have the cable.\n- File Management: Support New/Rename/Cut/Paste/Delete.\n- Movie Thumbnail: Easy to find the movie you want to view.\n- Different Play Mode: Support Loop off/Loop One/Loop all.\n- Screen Lock: View your movie even on the bed.\n- Dynamically Menu: Dynamically choose audio/subtitle channel and encoding method.\n- Gesture support: Easier way to do seek while playing the movie.\n- Resume Function: Don't worry about closing your application suddenly.\n- TV Out: Both cable TV out and AirPlay are supported.\n- iTunes Backup: By default, we will not backup media data when you do iTunes sync or iCloud backup, and you can't see the files in iTunes, you can enable it in the settings page to backup your media data.\n\n* FAQ\n\n- How do I put files into GPlayer? \nTo add files to your GPlayer app, you have to go to iTunes, and select the “Apps” tab. At the bottom of this page, there’s a “File sharing” section – just select GPlayer in the list, and add files from there. Note that you don’t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the “File sharing” tab, and they’ll be uploaded immediately. You can even use a friend’s iTunes to add videos to your own iPhone. Also, adding files over WiFi is supported. Indeed, WiFi is significantly slower than USB, and ruins the battery life.\n\n- What kind of streams does GPlayer play? \nGPlayer is able to play RTSP and MMS streams. For now those can’t be added to the media library, but you can click an RTSP or MMS url in Safari or Mail for example.\nIf you want to use GPlayer to open HTTP/FTP streaming, add \"gplayer:\" prefix in the URL.\n\n- I want to explicitely open an attachment with GPlayer? \nIf you want to watch an attachment in GPlayer(from Mail for example), just do a long press on the attachment. A menu will pop-up that will let you pick GPlayer as a player.\n\n- iTunes won’t let me install GPlayer on my iPhone or iPod Touch? \nUnfortunately, we had to drop support for older iOS devices such as the iPhone 3G or the first two versions of iPods. Indeed, after some testing, we realized those weren’t fast enough to provide a pleasant experience.\n\n- Why HD MKV movies don’t play smoothly? \nCurrently, only iPad 2 supports 720p MKV file, that’s to be expected. The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n- The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable \"Skip Frame\" in the settings page.\n\n- Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, supports iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.\n\n* Contact us\n\nMail: gplayersupport@hotmail.com\nWebsite: gplayersupport.wordpress.com\n\n* If you want to help to translate GPlayer to your mother language, just drop a mail to gplayersupport@hotmail.com, that will help people in your country enjoy this software, and we will put your name in thanks page!"

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "AutoPad is the easiest way to bring ambient pad loops into your mix!\n\nAutoPad generates atmospheric drone sounds that lend subtle structure to your live performances and recordings. Simply tap a key, and AutoPad will provide a tasteful soundscape that plays for as long as you like. Natural crossfades between keys are handled automatically.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Perform with ease. AutoPad has two modes: Live mode gives you instant access to all twelve keys, and setlist mode lets you build a custom list of songs.\n\n- Set the mood. AutoPad comes with 10 carefully designed pad sounds. Each one creates a unique atmosphere in all 12 keys.\n\n- Expand your library. You can add to the factory sounds by importing your own pads or by purchasing one of the in-app sound packs.*\n\n- Shape your sound. AutoPad's menu gives you control over crossfade time, high-pass and low-pass filters, reverb amount, pan, and volume.\n\n- Easy on storage. AutoPad's seamlessly looped sample-based drones contain just what you need to provide a pleasing atmosphere and don't take up excessive space on your device.\n\n- Stay in sync. AutoPad features a customizable metronome with a dedicated pan control. Keep your band locked in without needing to lug around a tracks rig.\n\n- Deep MIDI Control. AutoPad's MIDI Actions menu makes it easy to customize how AutoPad responds to your MIDI controller.\n\n- Use with other apps. AutoPad comes with a fully-featured AUv3 plugin! Run AutoPad alongside other music apps in your favorite AUv3 host.\n\n- Now on the Mac. AutoPad runs on macOS! You can use AutoPad as a standalone app or as an AUv3 plug-in in a compatible host. Both Intel and M1 Macs supported.\n\n- Go Wireless. Ableton Link lets you stay in sync with other devices on the same Wi-Fi network. AutoPad also supports Bluetooth MIDI controllers and AirPlay audio. \n\n- Share with friends. Make sure your band is all on the same page by easily sharing setlists with AirDrop.\n\n- Stay organized. AutoPad lets you save and recall setlists with a simple setlist manager.\n\n- Looks great. AutoPad features a dark color scheme that is easy on the eyes and performs well on the stage.\n\n\nNote on use: \n\nAutoPad sounds great in a variety of contexts, but please make sure you understand the intended use before purchase.\n\nAutoPad's sounds are designed to be played softly and continuously behind live musicians. They include the root, fifth, and octave. As such, they can be used in a major or minor context. When using AutoPad in worship music, it is not necessary to change the pad with each chord change. For example, if you have a song in the key of E, you can play a pad in E for the duration of the song.\n\n\nView Manual: https://www.audiosymmetric.com/manuals.html\nView Tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Uka-nFom-pgTB-DftgDvA\n\n\n* While files of any length can be imported into AutoPad, due to realtime memory restrictions, AutoPad loads a 3.5 minute subsection of files longer than four minutes. A short fade is applied to eliminate pops. See manual for details."

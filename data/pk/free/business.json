      "label": "A simple tool for businesses to talk to their customers. — WhatsApp Business from Meta\n\nWhatsApp Business enables you to have a business presence on WhatsApp, communicate more efficiently with your customers, and help you grow your business.\n\nIf you have separate business and personal phone numbers, you can have both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger installed on the same phone, and register them with different numbers.\n\nIn addition to the features available in WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business includes:\n\n• BUSINESS PROFILE: Create a profile for your business to help your customers find valuable information — like your website, location, or contact information.\n\n• BUSINESS MESSAGING TOOLS: Be more responsive to your customers by using Away messages to indicate that you're away.\n\n• LANDLINE/FIXED NUMBER SUPPORT: You can use WhatsApp Business with a landline (or fixed) phone number and your customers can message you on that number. During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

According to various traditions, different parts of the Quran are described to have a positive effect on an individual in terms of negating and preventing the effects of witchcraft, or for general well being and becoming a better practicing Muslim.\n\nThese are 33 verses of the Quran which eliminate the affects of Magic and become a means of protection from Satan, thieves and harmful beasts and animals.\n\nThe Manzil comprises the following verses of the Quran:\n\n+Surah Al-Fatihah (chapter 1): verses 1 to 7\n+Surah Al-Bakarah (chapter 2): verses 1 to 5, 163, 255 to 257, and 284 to 286\n+Surah Al-Imran (chapter 3): verses 18, 26 and 27\n+Surah Al-A'araf (chapter 7): verses 54 to 56\n+Surah Al-Israa (chapter 17): verses 110 and 111\n+Surah Al-Muminoon (chapter 23): verses 115 to 118\n+Surah Al-Saaffaat (chapter 37): verses 1 to 11\n+Surah Al-Rehman (chapter 55): verses 33 to 40\n+Surah Al-Hashr (chapter 59): verses 21 to 24\n+Surah Al-Jinn (chapter 72): verses 1 to 4\n+Surah Al-Kaafiroon (chapter 109): verses 1 to 6\n+Surah Al-Ikhlas (chapter 112): verses 1 to 4\n+Surah Al-Falaq (chapter 113): verses 1 to 5\n+Surah Al-Naas (chapter 114): verses 1 to 6\n\nThe entire Manzil is recommended to be read in one or three times in one sitting.

      "label": "Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational app to help your toddler learn phonics and trace letters of the alphabet? Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

But we’re also talking about tens of incredible paper airplane models: flying ones for you pilots-at-heart, and stationary ones for the true builders among you.

Students mostly clear the exam in 2nd or 3rd attempt. A maximum of 3 attempts are allowed under the age of 30, unless you are a government employee or domicile of Azad Kashmir in which case the age limit is 32.\n\nWe hope you would encourage our work by giving us a 5-star rating.

      "label": "Surah Mulk (سورة الملك) was revealed in Mecca, it is thirty passages long, consisting of 330 words and 1300 letters. Surah Mulk is part of Juz 29.\n\nAll of the Quran is blessed and parts of the Quran we have been informed about their specific blessing and others we have not. One such Surah that we have been informed about its blessing is Surah Mulk.\n\nNotice that death comes first as this is much harder to deal with its consequences than life. When death comes it takes us out of our comfort zones as it scares us into considering our mortality. Life can be a trail for parents who do not wish to have children. They worry about provision and other unnecessary concerns.\n\nWhen you ponder these meanings then you begin to think about the ephemeral nature of life and then you begin to contemplate the afterlife.\n\nThere are many hadith explaining its qualities and its benefits we shall go through some.\n\nThis does not just mean that we memorize it verbatim but are heedless of its meanings. Learn the meanings as well, then when you recite it you go over the meanings thus increasing your attendance in the prayer.\n\nAllah (may Allah bestow peace and blessings upon him) said, “It is a protector; a rescuer; saving from the chastisement of the grave.” (At-Tirmidhi and Al-Hakim.)\n\nThe grave is one of the most daunting abodes that someone will enter as it will be as you were, in the world. There is no hiding or pretending in the grave and here, in this place of maggots and worms, it comes to save you. As its recitation will protect us against being punished in the grave as the time in the grave will be longer than the time on earth, it is without comparison.\n\ndefend yourself at that time but because you read it an angel comes to protect you. Also look at the ninety other blessings that you receive for reading it."

The GRE word list is culled to only 250 so that you focus on only the most important words.\n\n\nYour practice will focus on the words that you need to review the most to make sure the words you learn will really stick.\n\n\nWhat is Magoosh?\n\n===\n\nMagoosh is an online test prep company with a focus on teaching the GRE.\n\n\nThe Magoosh team blogs about GRE words, formulas, grammar, problem solving, quantitative reasoning, and reading comprehension along with GRE study guides and study tips.\n\n\nHow else should I study?\n\n===\n\nSearch the app store for “magoosh gre” to prep for the Revised GRE Exam with Magoosh’s video lessons app. Learn all the math, verbal, and writing you need to know for the test!\n\n\nWhat about other tests?\n\n===\n\nMagoosh also has apps for GMAT prep and English grammar.

I liked the visual indication of the three categories and their progress.”\n\n\n“The Magoosh staff was awesome; I peppered them with questions and requests and they always responded thoroughly and quickly.”\n\n\n“I didn’t have much time to prepare for the GRE, and Magoosh made it possible for me to succeed on the test in a short period of time. I looked at Kaplan GRE, Barron’s, and Princeton Review products, and I can confidently say that Magoosh was definitely the best.”\n\n\n“The team is really great and actually cares about your score as much as they would care about their own. Simply the best.”\n\n\nDon’t wait until the last minute to start studying, start memorizing words today!"

The reports of the Prophet's (saw) sayings and deeds are called ahadeeth. Imam Bukhari lived a couple of centuries after the Prophet's (saw) death and worked extremely hard to collect his ahadeeth. Each report in his collection was checked for compatibility with the Qur'an, and the veracity of the chain of reporters had to be painstakingly established. Bukhari's collection is recognized by the overwhelming majority of the Muslim world to be one of the most authentic collections of the Sunnah of the Prophet(pbuh).\n\nApp Features : -- \n\n- Complete Sahih Bukhari \n- Urdu Searching \n- English Searching \n- Search feature include \"Search word Highlighted\"\n- Open Last Read \n- Five (5) Different Arabic Fonts\n- Five (5) Different Urdu Fonts\n- Five (5) Different English Fonts\n- Ability to show/hide Arabic Translation\n- Ability to show/hide Urdu Translation\n- Ability to show/hide English Translation\n- Customize Arabic Font Size\n- Customize Urdu Font Size\n- Customize English Font Size\n- Save Unlimited Bookmarks\n- Copy/Share Hadith \n\nPlease share this app with your family and friends and give us your valuable feedback on AppStore"

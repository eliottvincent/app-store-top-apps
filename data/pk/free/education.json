      "label": "Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational app to help your toddler learn phonics and trace letters of the alphabet? Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

      "label": "5 surah (Surah Yaseen, Surah Rahman, Surah Mulk, Surah Muzammil, Surah Waqiah, Surah Jinn, Surah Naba, Surah Kahf, Surah Dukhan and Surah Sajdah) is an Islamic application of 10 main Surah with audio.\n\n(1) Surah Yasin: Surah Yasin is one of the Qurani Surahs that Muslims love to read, listen, and memorize to get the blessings of Allah Almighty. Through this application, you can read and memorize the verses of Surah Yasin, and refresh your soul with heart touching recitations of the Surah\n\nSurely everything has a heart, and the heart of the Quran is Yaseen. I would love that it be in the heart of every person of my people.” (Tafsir-al- Sabuni Vol.2)\n\nRead and recite Surah Yaseen every morning, angels will escort you throughout the day, it also act as a performance booster by making each of your task hurdle free\n\n(2) Surah Rehman: Surat ar-Rahman (Arabic: سورة الرحمن), or al-Rahman, is the 55th sura of the Qur'an with 78 ayats. It has the refrain: \"Then which of your Lord's blessings would you deny?\"\n\nAfter offering each Prayer if someone recite Surah Rahman once without break and recite Durood Shareef 3 timesbefore and after Surah Rahman, so that person will get rid of his problem by the grace of Allah\n\n(3) Surah Mulk: A Surah in “Holy Quran” called the protector from the torment of the grave that is “Surah Mulk” surah 67.mp3 of Holy Quran. Are You a Beloved reciter of Holy Quran Recite Al Mulk tonight and every night to be protected from the torment of the grave? Even if you cannot read it all then read some of his Ayat or even listen this Surah\n\nOne this basis there is the hope that whoever believes in this soorah and reads it regularly, seeking the pleasure of Allaah, learning the lessons contained in it and acting in accordance with the rulings contained therein, it will intercede for him\n\n(4) Surah Waqiah: The Prophet said, ‘Whoever recites surah al Waqiah at night would never encounter poverty\n\nThe Prophet said, ‘Surah al Waqiah is the Surah of Wealth, so recite it and teach it to your children\n\nAbdullah Ibn Mas’ud, May Allah be pleased with him: Do you think that after my death my daughters going to face poverty and hunger? I don’t think so, because I’ve strictly instructed my daughters to recite Sura Waqiah every night. I’ve heard, Prophet salla Allahu alaihi wa sallam saying: one who will recite sura Waqiah every night, will never be needy/poor\n\n(5) Surah Muzzammil: This surah was revealed in Makkah and it has 96 ayaat. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) has said that a person who recites this surah will not be from among the absent-minded ones and Poverty does not come near this person.\n\n(6) There are 30 verses in Surah as-Sajdah Surah and it was revealed in Makkah. Some scholars say that the 19th, 20th and 21st ayaat of this Surah are ‘madani’.\n\n(7) Surah Dukhan takes its name from the word dukhan which occurs in verse 10.\n\nIts period of revelation also could not be determined from any authentic tradition, but the internal evidence of the subject matter shows that this Surah too was sent down in the same period in which Surah Zukhruf and a few other earlier Surahs had been revealed. However, this Surah was sent down somewhat later.\n\n(8) Surah Jinn: Al-Jinn (Arabic: الجن, “The Jinn”) is the 72nd chapter of the Quran with 28 verses. The name as well as the topic of this chapter is jinn.\n\n(9) Surah Naba: An-Naba or The News is the seventy-eighth chapter of the Quran, with forty ayat or verses.\n\n(10) Surah Kahf: Surah al Kahf is the 18th Surah of the Quran, al Kahf has 110 verses, 1742 words and 6482 letters, Surat kahf is found in the 15th & 16th juzz of the Quran."

      "label": "Surah Mulk (سورة الملك) was revealed in Mecca, it is thirty passages long, consisting of 330 words and 1300 letters. Surah Mulk is part of Juz 29.\n\nAll of the Quran is blessed and parts of the Quran we have been informed about their specific blessing and others we have not. One such Surah that we have been informed about its blessing is Surah Mulk.\n\nNotice that death comes first as this is much harder to deal with its consequences than life. When death comes it takes us out of our comfort zones as it scares us into considering our mortality. Life can be a trail for parents who do not wish to have children. They worry about provision and other unnecessary concerns.\n\nWhen you ponder these meanings then you begin to think about the ephemeral nature of life and then you begin to contemplate the afterlife.\n\nThere are many hadith explaining its qualities and its benefits we shall go through some.\n\nThis does not just mean that we memorize it verbatim but are heedless of its meanings. Learn the meanings as well, then when you recite it you go over the meanings thus increasing your attendance in the prayer.\n\nAllah (may Allah bestow peace and blessings upon him) said, “It is a protector; a rescuer; saving from the chastisement of the grave.” (At-Tirmidhi and Al-Hakim.)\n\nThe grave is one of the most daunting abodes that someone will enter as it will be as you were, in the world. There is no hiding or pretending in the grave and here, in this place of maggots and worms, it comes to save you. As its recitation will protect us against being punished in the grave as the time in the grave will be longer than the time on earth, it is without comparison.\n\ndefend yourself at that time but because you read it an angel comes to protect you. Also look at the ninety other blessings that you receive for reading it."

      "label": "We are a Ukrainian software developer creating apps for kids. We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education. And today, we are a 250-people team of dedicated designers, artists, animators, and educators. To date, we have more than 30 apps, with our user base having reached 98M.\n\nWe are inspired by the idea of bringing fun into early education and enhancing a child's natural love of learning through educational apps for kids.\n\nIf you need help, have questions or just want to say “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\nhttps://binibambini.com/privacy-policy/\n\nAll our games are safe, and do not collect any personal information."

And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

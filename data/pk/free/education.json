      "label": "Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational app to help your toddler learn phonics and trace letters of the alphabet? Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

Are You a Beloved reciter of Holy Quran Recite Al Mulk tonight and every night to be protected from the torment of the grave? Even if you cannot read it all then read some of his Ayat or even listen this Surah\n\nOne this basis there is the hope that whoever believes in this soorah and reads it regularly, seeking the pleasure of Allaah, learning the lessons contained in it and acting in accordance with the rulings contained therein, it will intercede for him\n\n(4) Surah Waqiah: The Prophet said, ‘Whoever recites surah al Waqiah at night would never encounter poverty\n\nThe Prophet said, ‘Surah al Waqiah is the Surah of Wealth, so recite it and teach it to your children\n\nAbdullah Ibn Mas’ud, May Allah be pleased with him: Do you think that after my death my daughters going to face poverty and hunger? I don’t think so, because I’ve strictly instructed my daughters to recite Sura Waqiah every night. I’ve heard, Prophet salla Allahu alaihi wa sallam saying: one who will recite sura Waqiah every night, will never be needy/poor\n\n(5) Surah Muzzammil: This surah was revealed in Makkah and it has 96 ayaat. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) has said that a person who recites this surah will not be from among the absent-minded ones and Poverty does not come near this person.\n\n(6) There are 30 verses in Surah as-Sajdah Surah and it was revealed in Makkah. Some scholars say that the 19th, 20th and 21st ayaat of this Surah are ‘madani’.\n\n(7) Surah Dukhan takes its name from the word dukhan which occurs in verse 10.\n\nIts period of revelation also could not be determined from any authentic tradition, but the internal evidence of the subject matter shows that this Surah too was sent down in the same period in which Surah Zukhruf and a few other earlier Surahs had been revealed. However, this Surah was sent down somewhat later.\n\n(8) Surah Jinn: Al-Jinn (Arabic: الجن, “The Jinn”) is the 72nd chapter of the Quran with 28 verses.

You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York. Lively, colorful, and sometimes surprising characters: an eccentric old lady will help you find a place to live, and a greedy hot-dog vendor who will try to short-change… They (and many more) speak different accents and will help you master street talk. There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go.

Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

Surah Mulk is part of Juz 29.\n\nAll of the Quran is blessed and parts of the Quran we have been informed about their specific blessing and others we have not. One such Surah that we have been informed about its blessing is Surah Mulk.\n\nNotice that death comes first as this is much harder to deal with its consequences than life. When death comes it takes us out of our comfort zones as it scares us into considering our mortality. Life can be a trail for parents who do not wish to have children. They worry about provision and other unnecessary concerns.\n\nWhen you ponder these meanings then you begin to think about the ephemeral nature of life and then you begin to contemplate the afterlife.\n\nThere are many hadith explaining its qualities and its benefits we shall go through some.\n\nThis does not just mean that we memorize it verbatim but are heedless of its meanings. Learn the meanings as well, then when you recite it you go over the meanings thus increasing your attendance in the prayer.\n\nAllah (may Allah bestow peace and blessings upon him) said, “It is a protector; a rescuer; saving from the chastisement of the grave.” (At-Tirmidhi and Al-Hakim.)\n\nThe grave is one of the most daunting abodes that someone will enter as it will be as you were, in the world. There is no hiding or pretending in the grave and here, in this place of maggots and worms, it comes to save you. As its recitation will protect us against being punished in the grave as the time in the grave will be longer than the time on earth, it is without comparison.\n\ndefend yourself at that time but because you read it an angel comes to protect you. Also look at the ninety other blessings that you receive for reading it."

Imam Bukhari lived a couple of centuries after the Prophet's (saw) death and worked extremely hard to collect his ahadeeth. Each report in his collection was checked for compatibility with the Qur'an, and the veracity of the chain of reporters had to be painstakingly established. Bukhari's collection is recognized by the overwhelming majority of the Muslim world to be one of the most authentic collections of the Sunnah of the Prophet(pbuh).\n\nApp Features : -- \n\n- Complete Sahih Bukhari \n- Urdu Searching \n- English Searching \n- Search feature include \"Search word Highlighted\"\n- Open Last Read \n- Customize Arabic Font Size\n- Customize Urdu Font Size\n- Customize English Font Size\n- Save Unlimited Bookmarks\n- Copy/Share Hadith \n\nPlease share this app with your family and friends and give us your valuable feedback on AppStore"

According to various traditions, different parts of the Quran are described to have a positive effect on an individual in terms of negating and preventing the effects of witchcraft, or for general well being and becoming a better practicing Muslim.\n\nThese are 33 verses of the Quran which eliminate the affects of Magic and become a means of protection from Satan, thieves and harmful beasts and animals.\n\nThe Manzil comprises the following verses of the Quran:\n\n+Surah Al-Fatihah (chapter 1): verses 1 to 7\n+Surah Al-Bakarah (chapter 2): verses 1 to 5, 163, 255 to 257, and 284 to 286\n+Surah Al-Imran (chapter 3): verses 18, 26 and 27\n+Surah Al-A'araf (chapter 7): verses 54 to 56\n+Surah Al-Israa (chapter 17): verses 110 and 111\n+Surah Al-Muminoon (chapter 23): verses 115 to 118\n+Surah Al-Saaffaat (chapter 37): verses 1 to 11\n+Surah Al-Rehman (chapter 55): verses 33 to 40\n+Surah Al-Hashr (chapter 59): verses 21 to 24\n+Surah Al-Jinn (chapter 72): verses 1 to 4\n+Surah Al-Kaafiroon (chapter 109): verses 1 to 6\n+Surah Al-Ikhlas (chapter 112): verses 1 to 4\n+Surah Al-Falaq (chapter 113): verses 1 to 5\n+Surah Al-Naas (chapter 114): verses 1 to 6\n\nThe entire Manzil is recommended to be read in one or three times in one sitting.

Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

Imam Bukhari lived a couple of centuries after the Prophet's (saw) death and worked extremely hard to collect his ahadeeth. Each report in his collection was checked for compatibility with the Qur'an, and the veracity of the chain of reporters had to be painstakingly established. Bukhari's collection is recognized by the overwhelming majority of the Muslim world to be one of the most authentic collections of the Sunnah of the Prophet(pbuh).\n\nApp Features : -- \n\n- Complete Sahih Bukhari \n- Urdu Searching \n- English Searching \n- Search feature include \"Search word Highlighted\"\n- Open Last Read \n- Customize Arabic Font Size\n- Customize Urdu Font Size\n- Customize English Font Size\n- Save Unlimited Bookmarks\n- Copy/Share Hadith \n\nPlease share this app with your family and friends and give us your valuable feedback on AppStore"

Through this application, you can read and memorize the verses of Surah Yasin, and refresh your soul with heart touching recitations of the Surah\n\nSurely everything has a heart, and the heart of the Quran is Yaseen. I would love that it be in the heart of every person of my people.” (Tafsir-al- Sabuni Vol.2)\n\nRead and recite Surah Yaseen every morning, angels will escort you throughout the day, it also act as a performance booster by making each of your task hurdle free\n\n(2) Surah Rehman: Surat ar-Rahman (Arabic: سورة الرحمن), or al-Rahman, is the 55th sura of the Qur'an with 78 ayats. It has the refrain: \"Then which of your Lord's blessings would you deny?\"\n\nAfter offering each Prayer if someone recite Surah Rahman once without break and recite Durood Shareef 3 timesbefore and after Surah Rahman, so that person will get rid of his problem by the grace of Allah\n\n(3) Surah Mulk: A Surah in “Holy Quran” called the protector from the torment of the grave that is “Surah Mulk” surah 67.mp3 of Holy Quran. Are You a Beloved reciter of Holy Quran Recite Al Mulk tonight and every night to be protected from the torment of the grave? Even if you cannot read it all then read some of his Ayat or even listen this Surah\n\nOne this basis there is the hope that whoever believes in this soorah and reads it regularly, seeking the pleasure of Allaah, learning the lessons contained in it and acting in accordance with the rulings contained therein, it will intercede for him\n\n(4) Surah Waqiah: The Prophet said, ‘Whoever recites surah al Waqiah at night would never encounter poverty\n\nThe Prophet said, ‘Surah al Waqiah is the Surah of Wealth, so recite it and teach it to your children\n\nAbdullah Ibn Mas’ud, May Allah be pleased with him: Do you think that after my death my daughters going to face poverty and hunger? I don’t think so, because I’ve strictly instructed my daughters to recite Sura Waqiah every night. I’ve heard, Prophet salla Allahu alaihi wa sallam saying: one who will recite sura Waqiah every night, will never be needy/poor\n\n(5) Surah Muzzammil: This surah was revealed in Makkah and it has 96 ayaat. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) has said that a person who recites this surah will not be from among the absent-minded ones and Poverty does not come near this person.\n\n(6) There are 30 verses in Surah as-Sajdah Surah and it was revealed in Makkah. Some scholars say that the 19th, 20th and 21st ayaat of this Surah are ‘madani’.\n\n(7) Surah Dukhan takes its name from the word dukhan which occurs in verse 10.\n\nIts period of revelation also could not be determined from any authentic tradition, but the internal evidence of the subject matter shows that this Surah too was sent down in the same period in which Surah Zukhruf and a few other earlier Surahs had been revealed. However, this Surah was sent down somewhat later.\n\n(8) Surah Jinn: Al-Jinn (Arabic: الجن, “The Jinn”) is the 72nd chapter of the Quran with 28 verses. The name as well as the topic of this chapter is jinn.\n\n(9) Surah Naba: An-Naba or The News is the seventy-eighth chapter of the Quran, with forty ayat or verses.\n\n(10) Surah Kahf: Surah al Kahf is the 18th Surah of the Quran, al Kahf has 110 verses, 1742 words and 6482 letters, Surat kahf is found in the 15th & 16th juzz of the Quran."

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Bloom is the easiest & most affordable way to learn the ropes of therapy. Train your mind with personalized daily mental health education. We've made videos that help teach skills to manage stress and anxiety, improve sleep, build better habits, foster stronger relationships and improve one's quality of life.\r\n\r\nWe work with experts who are fluent in cognitive-behavioral-therapy (CBT). (More about why we chose CBT below). Bloom combines interactive video classes with journaling and mindfulness exercises to help you work on your mental well-being, change your mood & cultivate more joy in life.\r\n\r\nHOW DOES BLOOM WORK?\r\nBloom is your personalized journey to a healthy state of mind. Bloom combines digital programs, guided journaling, and emotional analysis to give you a new hyper-personalized digital therapy experience. Through guided video classes, you will learn new self-care practices to cultivate more joy, happiness, and positivity in your life. Improve your personal well-being, manage stress & anxiety and feed your emotional health.\r\n \r\nWHERE IS THE CONTENT COMING FROM?\r\nAll our classes are science-backed and bring you the latest research in mental health. Every video is designed & developed by a leading clinical therapist and best-selling author on CBT, Seth Gillihan, PhD. \r\n \r\nIS BLOOM SECURE?\r\nYour safety & security are our #1 priorities. All journaling entries are encrypted and saved in the cloud. Nothing is seen by humans. None of your training data is shared with third-parties or outside partners. \r\n \r\nIS BLOOM EFFECTIVE?\r\nThe team at Bloom understand how helpful cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be for folks who need to improve their mental well being. We focus on teaching about CBT because outside research shows, again and again, that it the most effective form of therapy to improve mental well-being for the vast majority of folks who experience symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Studies show that patients can get the benefits of learning CBT techniques without an in-person therapist. Bloom gives users the power to learn about mental health in a guided & self-directed way at their own pace. \r\n \r\nWHAT USERS SAY\r\nBloom is considered a cheaper and more accessible option:\r\n“Not everybody has access or can afford a therapist. This is like a therapist in my pocket. Personalized but still private.”\r\n“I love that I can do it at my own time and I don’t have to feel awkward talking to a stranger about my life.”\r\n“It’s an easy and private discrete thing, no one even has to know!”\r\n\r\nDO NOT USE BLOOM IF....\r\nCBT and digital options like Bloom aren't a fit for everybody. If you're suffering from severe depression or anxiety, Bloom education alone may not be the right choice for you. Bloom cannot and does not diagnose, only a medical provider can do that. If you are in need of a treatment plan, please seek care under the supervision of a medical professional. We are not a clinic, nor are we a medical device. We hope that you get the treatment you need. \r\n\r\nWHEN SHOULD I USE CBT?\r\nCBT can help people with depression by giving you tools to challenge the negative thoughts and override them with more realistic and positive thought processes. CBT is also used to help many more psychological problems. In some cases, other forms of therapy used at the same time may be recommended for best results.\r\n\r\nDOES IT WORK FOR TRAUMA?\r\nIf you have been diagnosed with PTSD, your provider may have suggested CBT. But if you were diagnosed with cPTSD (complex PTSD), your medical professional may prefer you to use a DBT program. At this time, Bloom does not offer DBT. \r\n\r\nCONNECT WITH US!\r\nWe’re always keen on getting feedback from you.\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.\r\n\r\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\r\nTerms of service: https://www.enjoybloom.com/terms\r\nPrivacy policy: https://www.enjoybloom.com/privacy\r\nEmail us: support@enjoybloom.com"

When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility.

      "label": "The pressures of modern living can negatively affect us all, raising our levels of anxiety and stress and leading us to overwhelm. Hearing that there is an epidemic of poor mental health and sleep deprivation can add to our worries and fears and disempower us from dealing with everyday life.\n\nAt the same time, many people report finding mindfulness and meditation difficult to engage with or commit to. This can be because hearing a stranger's voice or responding to suggestion can engage our minds with perceptions and even memories that make it hard for us to silence our inner worlds or voice of consciousness.\n\nIf this is you, or if you are just looking for different relaxation techniques or a non-intrusive mechanism to help restore you, then music can become as disconnective and liberating as you need it to be. The key is to allow yourself to tune in to what works for you.\n\nIf it is enough for you to just listen to the music and sound therapies on their own, do just this. If you need more absorption you can add a self-guiding motion visual to enhance your experience. This blended method can be a beautiful and joyful multi-sensory experience that is both captivating and calming, allowing you to go deeper in to yourself to tune in to your needs. This can activate the healing process by re-setting your personal physical frequencies and re-calibrating your energy. It can also refresh your ability to think lucidly and positively.\n\nMusic Medicine\n\nIt can be said that any music that makes you feel better is medicinal! We also include Solfeggio and Chakra balancing frequencies in our catalogue. These audio tones help to promote various aspects of body and mind health. Reputed to date back to ancient history they are said to be the fundamental sounds used in both Western Christianity and Eastern Indian religions, chanted by the Gregorian Monks and in ancient Indian Sanskrit chants. Every Solfeggio tone is believed to comprise frequencies necessary for balancing energy, and keeping the spirit, mind, and body in a perfect form of harmony. In addition to Solfeggio, there are brain entrainment frequencies which are called Isochronic Tones; low frequency pulses that can influence and drive brainwave activity to a more desired mental state. More information on Solfeggio and Isochronic tones can be found here.\n\n\nSelf-Guided Visualisation\n\nThe mind is powerful, and with the right visual stimulus it can have an extraordinary effect on the body. Studies have shown how our bodies can have the same physical reaction whether we are actually experiencing something in the real world or through a virtual encounter. If you imagine the feeling of a cold winter’s day, or that of an unbearably hot summer day, your body responds as though you are actually experiencing those situations.\n\nOur minds can achieve the same result. As we imagine a pleasurable scenario, with the help of some visual motion image prompts, we have the ability to quickly transport ourselves to somewhere calm and relaxing and create something close to the same physical and emotional wellbeing. Is it the beach, or do you feel relaxed by the sight of a flickering candle or camp fire? We have captivating visuals that will take you there. \n\n*** Categories and features\n\nMusic genres:\n\nSolfeggio (including Isochronic beats)\nDeep Sleep\nShamanic Drums\nASMR\nChakra Balance\nMindfulness\nTinnitus Relief\nRelaxation\nWorld Music\nIntriguing & Fun\nLo-Fi\nLullaby\n\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n70+ original compositions\n50+ mesmerizing motion visuals\nNo sign-up\nNo ads\nFree music\nPremium music\nNew music and visuals added regularly\nPlay offline\nTimer/Fader\nEndless loop\nBuilt-in sound player\nControl music layers\nGenre / therapy information\nMusic reviews\nAdd favourites\nAuto-save sound signature\nManage downloads\nWi-fi check for downloads\nWellness resources\niphone (works on iPad)"

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "LISTEN TO THE TEXT ANYWHERE:  Musical Reader:Text-to-Speech is an app that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to customise your narration. Modify the voices of Amy, Joanna, and Mathew to best suit your needs. You may control aspects of speech, such as pronunciation, volume, pitch, speed rate, speaking mode, casual or formal, etc. \n \nTEXT WITH MUSIC: With neural AI narration, you can convert text to music. With this premium, high-fidelity voice, you may listen to news, stories, analyses, articles, reports, verses, quotes, poems, and much more. Select a different reading style. Discover a unique way to listen to text by combining several musical genres, including Lo-Fi, Summer, Movie, Natural, Atmospheric, and more.\n\nNARRATE OVER A VARIETY OF BACKGROUND MUSIC: Listen to the text while listening to popular music in the background. You can use your favourite music as a background and overlay it on the reader's screen. For your Instagram reel or Tiktok, create a popular voiceover.\n\nCONVERT TEXT INTO MP3 TO GET AUDIO FILES: With our advanced sound filters, you can tickle your musical senses, making it more fun! Pitch, music rollover time, pitch, and speaking mode can all be changed.Share your text-converted musical file with your friends and family. Listen to your creation in the history section. Export and share high-quality audio files. For Instagram reel voiceovers, use audio files.\n\nCHOOSE A VOICE AGE AND SPEAKING MODE:  Listen to voices that make you feel close to someone you know and read aloud like a toddler or a man reading in a baritone voice.\n\nUSEFUL FOR ALL TYPE OF DOCUMENTS: Make it a PDF reader by capturing a PDF, taking a screenshot, documenting, or importing a picture. Unlike most text-to-speech (TTS) voice aloud readers, this one is powered by powerful neural voices with great fidelity.\n\nSHARE YOUR CREATION AND LISTEN TO IT IN THE HISTORY SECTION: Musical Reader text-to-speech can read books, documents, and articles to you as you cook, work, commute, or do other things. All of this can be listened to by going to the history section where it is saved.\n\nWe're more than simply a text-to-speech app; we include original neural voices and music. Our text-to-voice technology gives customers complete control, which is a key differentiator for us.\nProfessionals, students, and persons with dyslexia, ADHD, A.D.D, low vision acuity, concussions, and other reading difficulties can benefit greatly from this app.\n\n\n\nWe used Amazon's POLLY voice library to build our neural engine.\n\n\"Musical Reader\" plan:\n* Monthly: $0.99 per month\n \nThese are the prices for customers in the United States.Pricing in other countries may vary, and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on the country of residence.\n \nPayments and Renewal:\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes Account upon purchase confirmation.

Sadece şirket kurmakla kalmayan, girişimcilik sistemi içinde \nilişki kuran, okuyan, toplantılara katılan, sosyal medyada etkin olan yeni bir kitle yükseliyor. Türkiye’de kurulan şirket sayısında müthiş bir \nartış yok ama şirket kuranların profili değişiyor. Daha çok genç ve meraklı insan kendi işini kuruyor. Geçmişten farklı olarak giderek artan sayıda \nMelek Yatırımcı ya da Risk Sermayesi kuruluşları ortaya çıkıyor. Konferanslar, ödüller, girişimcilik kampları, sosyal siteler, üniversite oluşumları ardı ardına devreye giriyor. \nBu büyük hareketliliğin en önemli eksiği START UP dergisi idi. Girişimcilik dünyasının bütün kesimleriyle konuşarak, onları kapsayarak yayın hayatına Nisan 2014’de başlayan Startup dergisi, Başarı Öykülerinden Yeni Trendlere, Melek Yatırımcılardan Yeni Finans Tekniklerine, Projesi Olanlardan Okullu Girişimcilere kadar geniş bir alana hitap ediyor."

      "label": "Noa brings you the world’s best journalism, curated by editors and read aloud by professional voice actors. We aim to provide multiple perspectives on trending news topics, through a highly involved curation process where Noa’s editors hand-pick the very best articles from the world's best publishers.\n\nIn a world with polarised opinions and ideology-driven media coverage, are you seeking multiple viewpoints? Start listening to Noa to save you time in exploring varying perspectives and to help you stay informed on the topics everyone is talking about.\n\nIt integrates easily into your daily or weekly routine. Listen while exercising, driving, cooking, or walking.\n\nTOP PUBLISHERS. ONE APP\nOur partnering publishers include\n\n• The Economist\n• Harvard Business Review\n• The Washington Post\n• The Telegraph\n• Bloomberg\n• The New York Times\n• Fast Company\n• Insider\n• MIT Technology Review\n• Foreign Affairs\n• The Independent\n• The Conversation\n• And more.\n\nOUR EDITORIAL PRINCIPLES\t\n1. Multiple Perspectives: Offer multiple perspectives from trusted sources and empower listeners to make up their own minds on where they stand on a topic.\n2. Thought-provoking: Present audio articles that inform, inspire, and offer fresh insights, through both a global and a national lens. Focus on opinion, feature, and analysis articles.\n3. Storytellers: Be storytellers and educators. Help our listeners understand global topics, and perspectives, while also telling the stories of the people behind the headlines.\n4. Global Impact: Ensure coverage and raise awareness of important topics, regardless of a topics popularity or ability to drive “clicks”. \n5. Fourth Estate: Uphold journalism’s values as a democratic check on power. And always celebrate great journalism.\n6. Embrace Complexity: Encourage thought and avoid black and white explanations that aren't followed with depth. The world is complicated and can seldom be explained in minutes. Our goal is to help listeners navigate it. \n\nAUDIO STORIES\nListening to the best journalism is a great way to learn and grow, especially when you don’t have time to read. Audio articles are produced and recorded daily by Noa’s talented voice actors – Sam Scholl, Adrienne Walker, Peter Hanly, Martin Buchanan, Les Smith, Grainne Brookfield and Jessie McGee. They’re probably in the booth recording as you read this!\n\nAUDIO SERIES\nEach day, Noa’s editor’s select the very best audio articles and add them to topic-specific playlists. Every Series begins with a short explainer – written by a Noa editor – that provides valuable context on the subject at hand before you dive in. Within 20-30 minutes, you’ll walk away fully informed.\n\nAUDIO FEATURES\nAlong with the usual audio features, you’ll find: CarPlay, AirPlay, Offline Mode, Sleep Timer, Playback Speed Adjustment, an editable Article Queue, and Rewind and Fast-forward.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nWe know you expect more.

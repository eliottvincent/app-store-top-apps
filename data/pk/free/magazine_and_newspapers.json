      "label": "Magasinet för den tänkande fotbollsfanatikern.\n\nLäs Offside som e-magasin. Sveriges största fotbollsmagasin i smidig digital version.\n\nOffside startade redan 2000 och blev snabbt ett omtyckt magasin bland fotbollsälskare. Sedan dess har vi fortsatt att utveckla vårt berättande. Vår kvalitetsjournalistik har belönats med många priser, såsom Stora journalistpriset, Tidskriftspriset, Publishingpriset och Årets sportjournalist.\n\nTre saker som kännetecknar Offsides journalistik:\n\n• Berättarglädje. Offsides reportrar brinner för att skildra de historier inifrån fotbollsvärlden som i över 20 år har varit Offsides kännetecken – journalistik som går på djupet och som måste få ta tid. Med oförvanskad nyfikenhet söker vi oss till de hörn av världen där vi vet att det finns bra och okända fotbollsöden.\n\n• Bildjournalistik i världsklass. Sveriges skickligaste sport- och reportagefotografer fångar närkamper, avgörande ögonblick och fotbollsprofiler när de är som mest sårbara. Få tidskrifter (om ens någon!) satsar så mycket på bildberättande som Offside.\n\n• Oberoende. Som läsare av Offside slipper du fantasilösa annonser som lockar med »free spins och »maxade odds«. Sedan hösten 2018 innehåller varken magasinet, hemsidan eller podcasten någon spelbolagsreklam.\n\nHär i appen kan du smidigt läsa aktuella och tidigare nummer i din telefon eller läsplatta. Du bläddrar dig enkelt framåt i en e-tidningsversion av magasinet. Klicka på en artikel och du får upp den i läsläge för mobilen eller läsplattan. Du kan också välja att ladda ned ett nummer till din enhet."

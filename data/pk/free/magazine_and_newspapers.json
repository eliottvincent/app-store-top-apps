Pitch, music rollover time, pitch, and speaking mode can all be changed.Share your text-converted musical file with your friends and family. Listen to your creation in the history section. Export and share high-quality audio files. For Instagram reel voiceovers, use audio files.\n\nCHOOSE A VOICE AGE AND SPEAKING MODE:  Listen to voices that make you feel close to someone you know and read aloud like a toddler or a man reading in a baritone voice.\n\nUSEFUL FOR ALL TYPE OF DOCUMENTS: Make it a PDF reader by capturing a PDF, taking a screenshot, documenting, or importing a picture. Unlike most text-to-speech (TTS) voice aloud readers, this one is powered by powerful neural voices with great fidelity.\n\nSHARE YOUR CREATION AND LISTEN TO IT IN THE HISTORY SECTION: Musical Reader text-to-speech can read books, documents, and articles to you as you cook, work, commute, or do other things. All of this can be listened to by going to the history section where it is saved.\n\nWe're more than simply a text-to-speech app; we include original neural voices and music. Our text-to-voice technology gives customers complete control, which is a key differentiator for us.\nProfessionals, students, and persons with dyslexia, ADHD, A.D.D, low vision acuity, concussions, and other reading difficulties can benefit greatly from this app.\n\n\n\nWe used Amazon's POLLY voice library to build our neural engine.\n\n\"Musical Reader\" plan:\n* Monthly: $0.99 per month\n \nThese are the prices for customers in the United States.Pricing in other countries may vary, and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on the country of residence.\n \nPayments and Renewal:\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes Account upon purchase confirmation. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n* After purchasing, you can manage or disable auto-renewal in your account settings at any time.\n* No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active period.\n \nRead more about our privacy policy here -\nhttps://www.trilonapps.com/musicalreader/musicalreaderprivacypolicy\n \nRead more about our terms of service here -\nhttps://www.trilonapps.com/termsofservice"

      "label": "JusttheNews.com is committed to just reporting facts from journalists with a long record of public trust and excellence. In an era where opinion and supposition are too often substituted for fact and where journalists rush to get things first and hope their stories are correct, JusttheNews.com tries to stand out by returning to the bedrock promise of getting news first, but first getting it right. We try to deliver exclusive news you can trust.\n \nJusttheNews.com is a back-to-the-future initiative where old-fashioned, honest and exclusive reporting is delivered in a neutral voice, but delivered through the modern channels of YouTube, podcasting, e-books and social media. And in a twist of old and new, JusttheNews.com journalists deliver unprecedented transparency by offering a Dig Deeper tool on their Web site that allows consumers to see the underlying core materials and evidence that substantiate each story. These embeds replace the shaky promise of modern journalists to \"just trust us, we're right\" with \"we trust readers to look at the facts and make up their own minds.\"\n\nJusttheNews.com is sticking just to the facts, without regard to outcome or personal bias. We will construct original, exclusive content with a neutrality and transparency that lets readers, viewers and listeners make up their own minds.\n\nJusttheNews.com is based in Washington, with an eye toward covering events in the capital for those who live outside it. It consists of four divisions dedicated to Web reporting, exclusive news, podcasting and long-form nonfiction book publishing.\n\nIts mission can be succinctly summarized by three brand statements:\n\nHonest Journalism, Trusted Reporters\nInformation Without Indoctrination\nRising Above Rhetoric"

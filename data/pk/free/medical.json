Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "Goli pharmacy is specialized in delivering genuine monthly medicines and health products for maintaining quality of life at the best value across Pakistan. \n\nGoli is an online pharmacy platform (marketplace) where you can purchase medicines online that serves patients with chronic needs by providing a better experience between the patient (consumer) and pharmacies. \n\nWe believe that the needs of a person who takes medicines everyday over a long period of time (chronic) to maintain certain aspects of their health are different then the needs of a person who has been prescribed medication for 5-7 days (acute) to a couple of weeks. \n\nWe have experienced chronic care management in countries with exceptional resources that have nearly universal health insurance coverage for outpatients, as well as countries with comparably lower healthcare standards where even the fraction of people who are able to pay for their own medicines to maintain their health are unable to do so. We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "ONLY DOCTORS WITH QARDIOMD ACCESS OR PATIENTS WHO ARE BEING MONITORED ARE ABLE TO LOGIN AND USE THE QARDIODIRECT APP.\n\nQardioDirect is the companion app for doctors with access to the QardioMD portal, and for patients those doctors are monitoring remotely.\n\nWith the QardioDirect app and Qardio devices, patients can reliably share medically accurate data such as:\n\n• ECG\n• Blood pressure\n• Heart rate\n• Irregular heartbeat detection\n• Blood oxygen level\n• Temperature\n• Weight, BMI, full body composition\n\nQardioMD is a powerful dashboard that lets doctors get just the right amount of data generated by their patients in an easy to view and understandable format.\nQardioMD continuously displays data in an actionable way, saving the doctor time and revenue while allowing them to provide better care. This HIPAA compliant solution allows clinicians to remotely monitor an unlimited number of patients and see who most needs their attention and who is doing well, all with a click of button. \n\nQardioDirect App:\n\n• Gives healthcare professionals an additional way to onboard new patients easily\n• Works with Qardio devices for in-clinic and at-home measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, ECG, heart rate, irregular heartbeat detection, blood oxygen level, temperature, weight, BMI and full body composition\n• Lets doctors demonstrate Qardio products to patients\n\nHow it works:\n\nPatients use FDA-cleared Qardio devices to monitor their health outside the doctor's office, which automatically share vitals with their provider.\n\nProviders use HIPAA-compliant QardioMD services. When a patient takes a measurement, the data is displayed in the secure QardioMD web portal.\n\nQardio does the rest. QardioMD continuously displays patient data, and with easy to use filters shows who needs priority attention.\n\nQardioDirect and Apple Health work seamlessly together, enabling easier health tracking with all your health and wellness information in one place. \n\nWhat other doctors have to say about Qardio:\n\n“I believe that good, high quality home blood pressure monitoring devices are going to be critical for achieving better blood pressure control in the US population. I’ve been very impressed with the QardioArm device, which we are currently using in the Health eHeart Study.” - Mark Pletcher, Health eHeart Study Principal Investigator, UCSF\n\n“As a physician, I believe people need to take control of their health and outcomes and this product being so easy to use, portable and most importantly accurate is a product I would recommend to all. Since stopping my denial and becoming a patient myself, I have done just that. Folks, the newest data regarding BP is irrefutable and having just one reading at a doctor’s office every so often is, in my opinion, the wrong way to detect hypertension and products like these should become part of a person's routine, especially as we age and our vessels become less compliant.” HB, Physician and QardioArm User, Amazon Review.\n\nQardioArm and QardioCore have regulatory clearance in the United States, European Economic Area, Canada. Qardio’s products and application should be only used in conjunction with professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and not as a substitute, or a replacement for it."

This is an important tool for any expectant mother!\n\nConsult your doctor to know how often and for how long you should be contracting.\nThis app is not a medical device; our recommendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the length and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the proper indicators, but labor pains become severe, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than have your baby at home or on the way there. Listen to what your body has to say.\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at hello@mindtastik.com. Your feedback is very important to us.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/Q6vbjMzk\nPrivacy policy: http://mindtastik.com/Mindtastik-privacy-policy.pdf"

MedShr is a totally secure, private network and features an easy to use in-app patient consent form and system for anonymising images.

Create a case, obtain consent and start a discussion securely from your mobile. Send medical cases to colleagues, share them with the wider community, export to your e-portfolio or simply organise cases for your personal records. MedShr is safe, secure and enables you to maintain complete control over the privacy of your cases - with all members being 100% verified as doctors, healthcare professionals and medical students.\n\nEXPAND YOUR PROFESSIONAL NETWORK\n\nMedical students and doctors of all levels are joining MedShr to advance their learning as they connect with peers from their university, place of work and across the world. Connect and follow specialists in your field to keep up to date on their latest cases, techniques and learnings. Join groups to learn from others, share findings or just converse around complex and interesting clinical cases. Medical students, junior doctors and specialist trainees use MedShr groups as a resource for informal learning, ahead of case-based examinations and as an aid to formal learning.\n\nMESSAGE CONNECTIONS AND COLLEAGUES\n\nMedShr Messaging allows you to message your connections about anything from arranging to meet at a conference to sharing a link to an interesting case. To get started, tap the message bubble in the top right-hand corner of the home feed to start a new chat. Use MedShr Messaging to reach out to colleagues and build your network.\n\nOBTAIN CPD CREDITS AND SHOW PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nThere are opportunities to learn from and reflect on cases every day.

The simple process makes it easy to receive CPD credit and keep a record of your learning on the go.\n\nHELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THOSE IN NEED\n\nOur community is providing medics in crisis zones and doctors in developing countries with quick access to second and specialist medical opinions so that they can make critical clinical decisions. With your participation, you can collaborate with like-minded professionals and be part of a new frontier in medical education.\n\n“MedShr is a brilliant idea - smartphones connect doctors, making it possible for aid workers to get an instant medical diagnosis” ***** - Rohan Silver, Evening Standard\n\nFor support, suggestions and feedback, please contact us at info@medshr.net"

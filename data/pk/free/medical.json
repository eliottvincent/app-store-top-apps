Whether prehypertensive or hypertensive, SmartBP can help you track your progress and manage all your blood pressure measurements with an overall goal of improving your blood pressure.\n\nDisclaimer: \n1) SmartBP al­lows you to record, track and an­a­lyze trends in your blood pres­sure. You can ei­ther man­u­al­ly en­ter your records or use a blood pres­sure mon­i­tor to sync with SmartBP through Apple Health. SmartBP alone does not mea­sure blood pres­sure. You need a sep­a­rate blood pres­sure mon­i­tor to mea­sure blood pres­sure.\n\n2) SmartBP is NOT a substitute for a doctor or professional healthcare or advice. Any health related information provided is for informational purposes only and should not be used to replace the advice of healthcare professionals.\n\nFor information on how to use the app, visit our website \n* Video: www.smartbp.app\n* FAQ: www.smartbp.app/faq \n\nFeatures- \n\n- Record systolic, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and weight. Body mass index (BMI), pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is automatically calculated. Now you can enable/disable weight monitoring. You can manually enter measurements or automatically and seamlessly sync them through SmartBP connected Blood Pressure Monitors.\n\n- Quickly add notes (e.g. before dinner) and measurement information (e.g. sitting, left arm) using tags. \n\n- Store and access all your blood pressure measurements anywhere and anytime using Apple HealthKit. Avoid manual data entry and reduce errors by automatically uploading blood pressure measurements to HealthKit by auto-syncing with SmartBP.

We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

      "label": "Join the millions of medical professionals who use MDCalc daily to support clinical decision making at the bedside. Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

      "label": "Medical Editor's Review:\nThis app allows you to view ECG recordings in real time demonstrating a wide range of different cardiac abnormalities. You can also read concise explanations of how each abnormality manifests itself in ECG findings. The ability to view these ECG recordings as often as desired makes this a valuable tool for mastering the nuances of ECG interpretation.\n\nCustomer reviews:\nThese apps have really been improving since recent updates. They are not designed as standalone tutorials, but rather serve as an excellent and extensive library of realistic example cases that illustrate principles of ECG interpretation, from the simplest to the very complex, and from the common to the very rare. Recent updates have expanded to include basic information on elements of ECG interpretation and cardiac physiology, which has added a new layer of depth to an already great collection of apps. Please, keep up the excellent work!\"\n\n\"A best and easy ecg interpretor which was very useful thanx ecg book...enjoy and try to learn\"\n\"Great app for practicing strips!!!

Measure your stress to manage it!\n\n- What is the principle behind StressScan? − \nMany of the functions essential to maintaining human health are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is medically recognized that the balance of the autonomic nervous system can become disordered through fatigue and other stress, stemming from causes such as work and human relationships. By analyzing the waveform of your heartbeat as measured at the fingertip, StressScan can analyze the balance of your autonomic nervous system and measure your stress level on a stress index of 1 to 100.\n\n- You can trust StressScan! - \nThe technology used by StressScan is based on heart rate variability analysis, which is widely recognized in the field of heart rate analysis and autonomic nervous system research. \nAlthough heart rate variability analysis technology is not yet generally well known, many medical institutions and companies have taken an interest and are beginning to put it to use. The technology is seeing use even at the cutting edge of stress care, including adoption by the US military to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers returning from the battlefield, and by NASA for astronaut training and health management.\n\n- Usable in a range of scenarios! - \n· Periodic checking of daily stress level\n· Checking the effects of favorite meals and drinks on stress\n· Checking relaxation while traveling or at a favorite spot\n\n- Device compatibility -\nThe app is intended for use with a camera- and flash-equipped smartphone. It is not usable with devices that do not have a camera and flash.\n\n- Usage environment -\nAn Internet connection is required to use the app. External support for measurement functions is used for complex stress analysis."

This app will improve your clinical skills more than reviewing with a book because you will learn to diagnose the rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\n\nThe app utilizes an organized four criteria approach to identify the rhythms. Then study the description of the rhythm to understand the electrophysiology. Use the same process to review all the ECG rhythms.\n\nThere are 80 ECG rhythms included in this app.\n\nWhen you feel you have mastered the rhythms in this program you should test yourself using the app Anesoft 'ACLS Rhythm Quiz'."

      "label": "Rhythm modules review ECG rhythm recognition. ACLS Cases is a simulator.\n\nThe new rhythm primer module presents the basics of reading electrocardiograms. The new challenge module provides three fun exercises to reinforce your ability to identify the EKG rhythm. This latest version has improved performance when internet connection is not available.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases will help you pass the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support ACLS course. With regular use of ECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases you will maintain your cardiac resuscitation skills so that you will always be ready to serve as an effective leader of the 'code blue' team.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases includes four modules to improve your ability to identify the ECG rhythm and treat the patient. The first module, ECG Rhythm Primer, reviews the basics of identifying the cardiac rhythm in electrocardiogram lead II. It describes the waves, intervals, and a four step method to identify the rhythm. Rhythm Tutor teaches and reinforces the organized four question approach to identification of electrocardiogram rhythms. When you think you have mastered identification of the rhythms in Rhythm Tutor, you should use Rhythm Challenge to test yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Rhythm modules present 80 different electrocardiogram wave forms as they sweep across the screen just like on a real ECG monitor. Recognition of EKG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will improve your clinical skills more than reviewing with a book because you will learn to diagnose the EKG rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\r\n\r\nAfter you are comfortable identifying the cardiac rhythm, you can use the ACLS Cases module to practice the resuscitation of patients based on the latest ACLS guidelines. ACLS Cases enables you to rehearse megacode management in a realistic screen-based simulator. The current version follows the updated 2015 AHA treatment guidelines. You must evaluate the patient and electrocardiogram rhythm, decide on the appropriate management, and serve as the team leader guiding two assistants through the resuscitation including administration of electrical defibrillation and medications.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 cardiac arrest case scenarios included. The first three cover ventricular fibrillation, the next two are for pulseless ventricular tachycardia, another covers asystole, and the remainder of the cases cover tachycardia algorithms. This app is for training purposes only. Do not assume a real patient will behave exactly the same as any of the simulated patients, however, with regular practice you will always be ready to run a full cardiac resuscitation."

Esta aplicación mejorará sus habilidades clínicas más que revisar con un libro porque aprenderá a diagnosticar los ritmos mientras se mueven dinámicamente por la pantalla.\n\nLa aplicación utiliza un criterio organizado de cuatro criterios para identificar los ritmos. A continuación, estudiar la descripción del ritmo para comprender la electrofisiología. Utilice el mismo proceso para revisar todos los ritmos de ECG.\n\nHay 80 ritmos de ECG incluidos en esta aplicación.\n\nCuando sientas que has dominado los ritmos en este programa debes probarte usando la aplicación Anesoft 'Quiz del ECG Ritmo'."

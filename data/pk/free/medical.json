We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

      "label": "Join the millions of medical professionals who use MDCalc daily to support clinical decision making at the bedside. Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

Meticulously built over ten years from high-resolution cross-sectional photographs of real cadavers, the app provides an accurate and visually stunning reconstruction of the anatomy of the abdomen.\n\nThe easy to use and intuitive interface lets you choose precisely the anatomy you want to see, from exactly the angle you want to see it. This flexibility is supported by a wealth of user-friendly tools to help you set up your ideal anatomical image, quickly and easily:\n\n•\tThe Gallery contains 22 pre-set scenes, designed by an in-house team of anatomical experts, to clearly and comprehensibly present in-depth regional and systemic anatomy of the abdomen. Each scene is divided into five layers to provide greater control over the depth of anatomy shown; making tailoring the anatomy you want to see simple and quick.\n\n•\tThe Contents folders arrange all 1,070 structures systemically, meaning you can browse by subcategory and switch all related structures on at once. It provides an excellent learning tool – for example turn on all branches of the superior mesenteric artery, or all the muscles of the abdominal wall.\n\n•\tThe Contents layer controls split each system into five layers – from deep to superficial. This allows you to quickly build up different systems to the depth you want to see.\n\n**Save to Favourites**\n\nSave the views you create for later in the Favourites, save anything as an image, or share with another user as a URL link. Use the pins, labels and drawing tools to customize your images for enlivened presentations, engaging course materials and handouts – all from your iPad!\n\n**Informative**\n\nRead detailed and accurate text for each structure using the T icon, and in a feature unique to Primal Pictures, each anatomical term in the text is linked to the appropriate model in the 3D model. Selecting these links will highlight the relevant structures, bringing the text to life and make learning anatomy more visual and immediate.\n\n**Context**\n\nSee each structure in context with the anatomy that surrounds it. Explore these relationships and easily navigate to related anatomical structures to expand your learning. Select a field name in the right-hand menu to show the anatomical category and sub-category of the structure for added understanding and simple navigation.\n\n**Technical Specifications**\n\niPad 3 and above only.\niPad Air and above for optimal viewing.\niPhone 6 and above for best performance."

      "label": "The Due Date Calculator app is a fertility-specific pregnancy due date calculator designed primarily for physician use. The app calculates the pregnancy due date for women who have undergone fertility treatment including embryo transfer, IUI and egg retrieval. Due date information may also be calculated using the date of ovulation. \n\nHow to Use the Due Date Calculator app:\n\nView the options in the dropdown menu under “Calculate Pregnancy By” header and make your selection. Next, using the “Select Date” menu, enter the appropriate date and press calculate. Results will indicate the date of the last menstrual period (LMP), estimated due date, gestational age of the baby and likely date of conception. \n\nThe Due Date Calculator app is appropriate for use in women with a history of infertility as well as those who conceived naturally. For the best results, use the most accurate data available. \n\nIf a baby was conceived by natural conception, the estimated due date is determined by the first day of the mother’s last normal menstrual period. If an ovulation kit was used to detect LH surge, the ovulation date should be used to determine the expected due date. Due dates can also be calculated using the embryo transfer date or date of insemination.\n\nPregnancy due dates are not precise, but rather an estimation of the day a woman might be expected to give birth. Most women deliver within a two week period before or after their anticipated due date.\n\nFor use with IVF, IUI, HCG Trigger, LH Surge, Embryo Transfer."

      "label": "Features:\n\n1. 3 classes of Amplifier with noise reduction. Users can choose their own volume amplification level, comfortable listening. \n\n2. Hearing Protection: Amplifying the volume can hear minute sound details, but if you enlarge any sound without limit, the loud sound can cause ear pain, dizziness, and even permanent hearing damage. This app uses advanced algorithms to enhance the lower sound while suppressing strong sound to protect your hearing.\n\n3. Multiple Scenarios Selection: This app has a 12-band audio equalizer designed specifically for hearing aids, and provides preset six kinds of listening scenarios  for conversational, music, video, and high, medium and low hearing loss. Users can also set their own scenario.\n\n4. Microphone Selection. Currently, different models of iPhones provide 3 to 4 microphones. They are located below the phone, next to the front camera and next to the back camera.  The user can select the microphone towards the sound source to get a clearer sound.\n\n5. Recall function.  It buffers the past five minutes sound for recall.  The function is like the black box of air plane. You can get back the past conversation if it is necessary. Or save it to an audio file as a keeper.\n\n6. A professional sound recorder is attached.  \n\n7. Voice to Text.  You can use hearing aids. At the same time, record audio files and convert speech to text.\n\n8 Support Bluetooth and wire headphone.\n\n9. Can run parallel with music or game apps.  Even if you listen to music, watch videos, play games, you can listen to the sound of environment.\n\n10.  High-quality sample rate. Use the sample rate of the CD quality to make the sound details perfectly present.\n\n11. Support sound balance. Users can adjust the volume for 2 ears individually.\n\n12.  Can run in the background and very low energy consumption. Even if the screen is locked, the software can be used normally.\n\n13. 7-day free trial\n\nLegal:\nPlease see Hearing Aid - Sound Amplifier’s “Terms of Services” and “Privacy Policy”\n\nTerms of Use:  http://www.dawnstreamsoft.com/tou_en.html\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.dawnstreamsoft.com/privacy.html\n\nSubscriptions\nHearing Aid - Sound Amplifier is available for free download.

      "label": "Goli pharmacy is specialized in delivering genuine monthly medicines and health products for maintaining quality of life at the best value across Pakistan. \n\nGoli is an online pharmacy platform (marketplace) where you can purchase medicines online that serves patients with chronic needs by providing a better experience between the patient (consumer) and pharmacies. \n\nWe believe that the needs of a person who takes medicines everyday over a long period of time (chronic) to maintain certain aspects of their health are different then the needs of a person who has been prescribed medication for 5-7 days (acute) to a couple of weeks. \n\nWe have experienced chronic care management in countries with exceptional resources that have nearly universal health insurance coverage for outpatients, as well as countries with comparably lower healthcare standards where even the fraction of people who are able to pay for their own medicines to maintain their health are unable to do so. We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\n\n\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals. It is a tool that anyone working in the medical industry should possess.\"\n\n\"Great app for keeping your skills sharp and seeing a wide variety of cases\"\n\nECG Pro provides: \n\n1) 3500+ abnormal real world 12 lead ECG cases in raw data (In-App-Purchase needed for advanced ones)\n2) Each case has professional interpretation and measurement \n3) They cover 100+ common ECG findings \n\n[Features] \n1) Browse ECG cases by findings like \"Atrial Flutter\", \"Escape Rhythm\" and more \n2) Search for whatever you want to learn, like \"Flat T wave\" \n3) Dynamically play each case in monitoring mode (with beeping sound) \n4) Display leads in 12 x 1, 6 x 2, 4 x 3 layout \n5) Each case has 12 template views with P / QRS / T waves identified \n6) Send cases to your friends, in PDF format \n\nFor students or interns, you can use the cases as learning resources. \nFor teachers, you can use the cases as teaching resources. \n\n[Note] \n1) All cases are stored in raw data (sample rate is 500hz), not static images, so you can look into very detailed waves in pixels \n2) You should already have basic knowledge of ECG interpretation, and you use the cases to build a solid cardiology foundation \n\n[Findings Covered] \nAtrial Flutter \nAtrial Fibrillation \nVentricular Fibrillation \nEscape Beat \nPAC (Premature Atrial Contruction) \nPAC Bigeminy \nPAC Trigeminy \nPVC (Premature Ventricular Contruction) \nPVC Bigeminy \nPVC Trigeminy \nSupraventricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Escape Rhythm \nVentricular Rhythm \nQT Prolongation \nShort QT \nHigh T \nST Elevation \nS1,S2,S3 Pattern \nHigh Voltage \nPositive T in V1 \nVentricular Hypertrophy \n\nand more..."

      "label": "This application is designed for professional dentists who want to advise their patients more effectively. A large collection of 3D illustrations of dental treatment is sorted into groups and located inside this application.\n\nQuick and easy. Many dentists draw illustrations on paper every time explaining the treatment process to their patients, which can take some time. Finding the necessary illustration in the application database is very simple- it will take you about 10 seconds. \n\nThe 3D illustration is better than a photo. Patients can be shocked and frightened by seeing photographs of blood operations or a real photo of teeth.  If you use 3D illustrations, the patient most likely will perceive such information loyally.\n\nQuality and precision. All illustrations are based on accurate anatomy, real procedures, and treatment, based on the support of professional doctors and dental surgeons. \n\nAccess to the necessary illustrations will be instant regardless of where you are. This application does not use the Internet traffic to download the illustrations, all necessary 3D illustration files are already contained within the application.\n \nThe category of selected illustration topics allows you to access the most frequently used topics even faster. To do this, you will need to transfer the necessary topic to the Favorites section.\n\nThe list of topics by category:\nAnatomy of teeth and jaws. Information schemes. \nHygiene and teeth whitening. The development of tartar and plaque. Cleaning.  \nTherapy- dental treatment. Different types of caries. \nProsthetics. Veneers, Restorations, Bridges, Crowns, Removable prostheses.\nImplantation. Bone Augmentation. Partial and complete rehabilitation of teeth.  \nOrthodontics. Braces, Occlusion, Congenital and acquired defects.\nPeriodontology. Various gum problems and their treatment.\nSurgery. Extractions, Hemisection, Sinus-lifting, Bone Augmentation.  \n\n\nThe gallery works on the principle of the slideshow presentation. You open a topic you are interested in, the topic itself can contain 3-10 images. You choose the most suitable illustration and show to the patient and consult him. Next, you can switch the related images from the topic while you continue to consult."

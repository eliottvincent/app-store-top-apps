Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

This simple tool lets you report adverse effects to medicines, keep track of previously reported information and receive official news and alerts about medicines you are taking or interested in. \n \nWhy use the app?\n \n• Quick and easy to report adverse effects\n• Instant access to medicines safety information\n• Help make medicines safer for all\n• It’s free!\n \nKey features of the app\n \n• Submit reports on adverse effects even while offline\n• View and submit updates to previously submitted reports\n• See immediate acceptance of your reports\n• Create a ‘watch list’ of medications to receive personalised news and alerts\n \nWhy does it matter?\n \nMedicines are developed to be as safe and effective as possible, but they can still cause side effects. It is important for people to report adverse effects to medicines as this information can be used to identify previously unknown issues with those medicines.\n \nAdverse effects sometimes stop patients from completing their treatment, which can lead to even more serious problems. Reporting adverse effects encourages a dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals and helps professionals to identify and investigate unknown or poorly described adverse effects.\n \nThe Med Safety app has been developed as part of the WEB-RADR project. WEB-RADR is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI JU) under grant agreement n° 115632, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and EFPIA companies’ in kind contribution."

With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\n\n\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals. It is a tool that anyone working in the medical industry should possess.\"\n\n\"Great app for keeping your skills sharp and seeing a wide variety of cases\"\n\nECG Pro provides: \n\n1) 3500+ abnormal real world 12 lead ECG cases in raw data (In-App-Purchase needed for advanced ones)\n2) Each case has professional interpretation and measurement \n3) They cover 100+ common ECG findings \n\n[Features] \n1) Browse ECG cases by findings like \"Atrial Flutter\", \"Escape Rhythm\" and more \n2) Search for whatever you want to learn, like \"Flat T wave\" \n3) Dynamically play each case in monitoring mode (with beeping sound) \n4) Display leads in 12 x 1, 6 x 2, 4 x 3 layout \n5) Each case has 12 template views with P / QRS / T waves identified \n6) Send cases to your friends, in PDF format \n\nFor students or interns, you can use the cases as learning resources. \nFor teachers, you can use the cases as teaching resources. \n\n[Note] \n1) All cases are stored in raw data (sample rate is 500hz), not static images, so you can look into very detailed waves in pixels \n2) You should already have basic knowledge of ECG interpretation, and you use the cases to build a solid cardiology foundation \n\n[Findings Covered] \nAtrial Flutter \nAtrial Fibrillation \nVentricular Fibrillation \nEscape Beat \nPAC (Premature Atrial Contruction) \nPAC Bigeminy \nPAC Trigeminy \nPVC (Premature Ventricular Contruction) \nPVC Bigeminy \nPVC Trigeminy \nSupraventricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Escape Rhythm \nVentricular Rhythm \nQT Prolongation \nShort QT \nHigh T \nST Elevation \nS1,S2,S3 Pattern \nHigh Voltage \nPositive T in V1 \nVentricular Hypertrophy \n\nand more..."

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

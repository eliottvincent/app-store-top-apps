      "label": "Goli pharmacy is specialized in delivering genuine monthly medicines and health products for maintaining quality of life at the best value across Pakistan. \n\nGoli is an online pharmacy platform (marketplace) where you can purchase medicines online that serves patients with chronic needs by providing a better experience between the patient (consumer) and pharmacies. \n\nWe believe that the needs of a person who takes medicines everyday over a long period of time (chronic) to maintain certain aspects of their health are different then the needs of a person who has been prescribed medication for 5-7 days (acute) to a couple of weeks. \n\nWe have experienced chronic care management in countries with exceptional resources that have nearly universal health insurance coverage for outpatients, as well as countries with comparably lower healthcare standards where even the fraction of people who are able to pay for their own medicines to maintain their health are unable to do so. We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

The app calculates the pregnancy due date for women who have undergone fertility treatment including embryo transfer, IUI and egg retrieval. Due date information may also be calculated using the date of ovulation. \n\nHow to Use the Due Date Calculator app:\n\nView the options in the dropdown menu under “Calculate Pregnancy By” header and make your selection. Next, using the “Select Date” menu, enter the appropriate date and press calculate. Results will indicate the date of the last menstrual period (LMP), estimated due date, gestational age of the baby and likely date of conception. \n\nThe Due Date Calculator app is appropriate for use in women with a history of infertility as well as those who conceived naturally. For the best results, use the most accurate data available. \n\nIf a baby was conceived by natural conception, the estimated due date is determined by the first day of the mother’s last normal menstrual period. If an ovulation kit was used to detect LH surge, the ovulation date should be used to determine the expected due date. Due dates can also be calculated using the embryo transfer date or date of insemination.\n\nPregnancy due dates are not precise, but rather an estimation of the day a woman might be expected to give birth. Most women deliver within a two week period before or after their anticipated due date.\n\nFor use with IVF, IUI, HCG Trigger, LH Surge, Embryo Transfer."

      "label": "This is simply the best Obstetrics calculator in the market.   This application is designed and written by a practicing OBGYN and tested clinically.  \n\n1)  Rapid Gestational Age Calculator:  having 8 date pickers enable a practitioner to enter the due day in less than 3 taps.   Each date picker is a month apart from one another.  One can easily scroll down to the desired month and then press to select the day of the month to complete the input.  Each of the date picker is numerically pre-assigned each time the user signs into the program.  \n\n2)  Fetal Weight Percentile:  weight percentile from 2 sources enhances clinical decision making.  Percentile information is calculated from employing error functions and z scores with the primary focus of being the most precise at the 10th percentile.  This percentile level is an important cut-off for deciding the course of action.  In addition, a weight projection at 39 weeks is revealed.  This projection provides improved obstetrical understanding of percentile and can help providers and families to better analyze their situations.\n\n3)  Final Estimated Due Day: physicians or assistants enter the first day of last menstrual period, date of ultrasound and gestational age to establish the final estimated due day. This is the calculation in accordance with the guidelines of ACOG.  Each clinical picture and comprehension shall be more pivotal than ACOG guidelines but this approximation can provide an impetus for discussion.\n\n4)  Weight Conversion: unit conversion from grams to pounds and vice versa is completed in this part of the program.  Ultrasound almost always generate an estimate in grams.  Many struggle to understand weight in grams while others face the challenge of locating a calculator swiftly.  This section yields the answer and saves time for more crucial or critical conversations in other areas.   \n\nDisclaimer\nThis application provides information that is meant to be educational.

The algorithms behind the App have been derived after an extensive research of the published materials on the aortic and mitral prosthetic valve assessment.\n\n\n- Check Valve Function\n\nAfter selecting a particular valve type, the patient characteristics (weight/height) and the prosthesis actual parameters (peak velocity, mean gradient, VTI prosthesis, VTI LVOT and LVOTd), Valve PPM will provide the user with an answer regarding the normal function of the valve, the potential patient prosthesis mismatch or the intrinsic prosthesis dysfunction.\n\n\n- Optimal Valve Selector\n\nThe user will be required to select a valve position (aortic/mitral) and the patient characteristics (weight/height) and Valve PPM will instantly indicate the minimum Effective Orifice Area (EOA) in order to avoid Patient Prosthesis Mismatch (PPM)."

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

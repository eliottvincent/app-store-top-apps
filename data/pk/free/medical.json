We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

Measure your stress to manage it!\n\n- What is the principle behind StressScan? − \nMany of the functions essential to maintaining human health are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is medically recognized that the balance of the autonomic nervous system can become disordered through fatigue and other stress, stemming from causes such as work and human relationships. By analyzing the waveform of your heartbeat as measured at the fingertip, StressScan can analyze the balance of your autonomic nervous system and measure your stress level on a stress index of 1 to 100.\n\n- You can trust StressScan! - \nThe technology used by StressScan is based on heart rate variability analysis, which is widely recognized in the field of heart rate analysis and autonomic nervous system research. \nAlthough heart rate variability analysis technology is not yet generally well known, many medical institutions and companies have taken an interest and are beginning to put it to use. The technology is seeing use even at the cutting edge of stress care, including adoption by the US military to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers returning from the battlefield, and by NASA for astronaut training and health management.\n\n- Usable in a range of scenarios! - \n· Periodic checking of daily stress level\n· Checking the effects of favorite meals and drinks on stress\n· Checking relaxation while traveling or at a favorite spot\n\n- Device compatibility -\nThe app is intended for use with a camera- and flash-equipped smartphone. It is not usable with devices that do not have a camera and flash.\n\n- Usage environment -\nAn Internet connection is required to use the app. External support for measurement functions is used for complex stress analysis."

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

This user-friendly application excels in its simplicity of use and is a great aid for those who care about their health. \n\nYou just enter the information of your age, gender, family anamnesis, physical condition, BMI, and other factors into your mobile phone.\n \nDiabetes mellitus represents one of the most frequent civilization diseases. Two basic types  are recognized: type 1 diabetes and  type 2 diabetes, which both develop due to an absolute or relative deficit of insulin. The diabetic thus cannot use his/her own blood glucose, which leads to increased blood sugar and other serious health consequences.\n \nDo not let diabetes take control over your life. Find out the possible risk of developing this disease and adopt the possible preventive measures in time.  Modern medicine is able to cure this disease.\n \nThe Diabetes Test application offers the following:\n● \tRisk test of disease development\n● \tDisease information\n● \tOption to send test results via e-mail\n● \tNext test date reminder \n● \tTips and tricks to reduce the risk of the disease\n● \tSharing option"

This easy-to-use and convenient format will further assist health care professionals in their implementation of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®), thus improving the quality and effectiveness of care provided to patients with cancer. \n\nNCCN is a not-for-profit alliance of leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education. NCCN is dedicated to improving and facilitating quality, effective, efficient, and accessible cancer care so patients can live better lives. Through the leadership and expertise of clinical professionals at NCCN Member Institutions, NCCN develops resources that present valuable information to the numerous stakeholders in the health care delivery system. By defining and advancing high-quality cancer care, NCCN promotes the importance of continuous quality improvement and recognizes the significance of creating clinical practice guidelines appropriate for use by patients, clinicians, and other health care decision-makers around the world.\n\nOver the past 25 years, NCCN has developed an integrated suite of tools to improve the quality of cancer care. The NCCN Guidelines® document evidence-based, consensus-driven management to ensure that all patients receive preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and supportive services that are most likely to lead to optimal outcomes. \n\nThe NCCN Guidelines are a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and interventions that apply to 97 percent of cancer cases in the United States. In addition, separate guidelines relate to major prevention and screening topics and another set of pathways focuses on the major supportive care areas. \n\nThe NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations based on the best evidence available at the time they are derived. Because new data are published continuously, it is essential that the NCCN Guidelines also be continuously updated and revised to reflect new data and new clinical information. The intent of the NCCN Guidelines is to assist in the decision-making process of individuals involved in cancer care—including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, payers, patients and their families—with the ultimate goal of improving patient care and outcomes. The NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations for appropriate care for most but not all patients; however, individual patient circumstances must be considered when applying these recommendations. \n\nVisit NCCN.org to learn more about the NCCN Guidelines as well as other NCCN Content."

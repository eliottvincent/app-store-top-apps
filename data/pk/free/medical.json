We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

      "label": "Blood pressure monitor & heart rate tracker app - Our application does not measure blood pressure. The app allows you to track it. For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "Start learning sonography today! Many different cases and pathologies. An ever expanding library of new patients for you to practice with. Learn the correct ultrasound probe movements with our scan tutorial. Revise anatomy with our labeling: It shows all important structures colored - for maximum clarity during scanning. We are the world's first realistic ultrasound simulator app. Scanbooster allows sonographers, medical doctors, students, and nurses to learn sonography with ease. Scanbooster puts a professor, a high-end ultrasound machine and many patients on your iPhone. It SIMULATES sonographic examinations with maximum realism.\nScanbooster comes with many different organs and even real pathologies that you can scan - just like with a real device. Just move your device to perform virtual scans. If you have both iPhone and iPad you can use your iPhone as a virtual ultrasound probe to control Scanbooster on your iPad. Just download the additional Scanbooster Control App!\n\nFeatures:\n\n-Easy navigation:\nLabeling of many important structures is available in every contained organ volume!\nIf you ever get lost, just turn on labeling to see every structure colored. Pathological structures will be labeled separately.\n\n-Learn the correct handling of an ultrasound transducer: With our scan-tutorial the correct handling and the different movements become easy to repeat for yourself.\n\n-Learn the difference between different ultrasound probes: We have included linear probes, curved probes and even intravaginal/intracavital probes in Scanbooster.\n\n-Included Pictogram:\nWith the pictogram, you'll always know where you are scanning currently. Just turn it on - with a single tap.\n\n-Many different cases:\nScanbooster features an ever-growing array of both physiologic cases and pathologic cases as well. For the first time, all medical doctors can scan even the rarest pathologies themselves -instead of only looking them up 2d in the textbook.\n\n-Innovative learning modes:\nWith our different learning modes, performing an ultrasound examination becomes a breeze. Scanbooster will show you various stats about your learning progress. That way you'll always keep track of your progress. If you should ever need help - Scanbooster has got you covered. Just like a professor that's always beside you. In our learning modes, Scanbooster will guide you to the right answer.\n\n-Scanning like the real thing:\nWith the optional Scanbooster Control App on your iPhone, scanning will feel almost like the real thing. Install it to your iPhone to control Scanbooster on your iPad. With it, your iPhone becomes a virtual ultrasound probe. On newer devices, realScan functionality supports all movements: fanning, rotating, rocking, sweeping, sliding and compression - all in the air. All movements are then sent to your iPad with a very fast Bluetooth connection. Your iPhone will be transformed into your virtual ultrasound probe. With Scanbooster Control you'll feel as if your patient was right in front of you!\n\n-Free lifetime updates for all volumes/organs:\nIf we add new features to any organ you can download it right away - for free!\n\n-Many options and settings:\nScanbooster has many options and settings - just like a real ultrasound machine. You can change brightness, contrast, zoom, depth,...and many more. We placed high importance on making Scanbooster feel a little like a real device. That way the transition will become much easier for you when you finally perform your examinations - with real patients and devices.\n\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

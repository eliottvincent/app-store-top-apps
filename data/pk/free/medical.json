We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

      "label": "Eat Sleep is the simplest way to track your baby’s eating, sleeping, and diaper habits. It’s designed so you don’t have to mess with timers, alarms, or typing. All the important stuff can be entered with a one-finger tap. View all eat/sleep/diaper events for each day, or view the combined history of any individual activity. As you continue using the app, you’ll be able to view trends from day to day, week to week, or month to month.\n\nUnlike some apps, Eat Sleep isn’t overflowing with features you may not need. A real, working, first-time mom helped design the app so it’s simple and easy to use. Eat Sleep tracks the information your baby’s physician cares about most without being needlessly complicated.\n\nEat Sleep also includes a simple note-taking feature which allows you to track special events or routines. You can also now track multiple children.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nEat – Track how long your baby was breastfed and which side. You can also track the amount of formula or pumped breast milk your baby consumed.\n\nSleep – Simple options and no calendars to mess with. Select when your baby finished sleeping and approximately how long—the app does the rest! Intuitive menus help jog your memory and let you enter blocks of time quickly.\n\nDiaper – Keep tabs on diaper changes and whether diapers were wet, dirty or both. This is especially important for breastfeeding moms who need to know if their baby is eating enough!\n\nBabySync - A paid feature that allows you to back up, share, and collaborate on your child with others!\n\n---\n\nEat Sleep is free but does contains ads. You can simply remove these ads while also supporting the makers of this app through an in-app purchase on the settings screen.\n\n----------\n\nNeed help with the latest version of Eat Sleep? Please email us at eatsleep@makesail.io. We're happy to help!"

Het beeldbellen is ook zonder zorg al erg welkom, denkt u eens aan het beeldbellen met uw kinderen, kleinkinderen, maar ook met de huisarts, maaltijden leverancier, gemeente ambtenaar en het buurthuis? U voegt zelf verwanten toe, heel gemakkelijk, op basis van hun e-mailadres.\r\n\r\nDe app heet iQAN, wat u uitspreekt als “i can” waarmee we u de regie geven over uw sociale netwerk (beeldbellen) maar ook regie over uw agenda, uw slimme apparaten (domotica) en misschien wel over uw eigen menukaart (tafeltje dekje). Het bedrijf achter iQAN heet CareScreen, wij bestaan al meer dan 10 jaar en mogen sinds die tijd applicaties ontwikkelen voor zowel ziekenhuizen, als verpleeghuizen en thuiszorgorganisaties.\r\nVoor wie is de app geschikt?\r\nVoor jong en oud, dat blijkt uit onze gebruikers ervaringen. Het enige wat u nodig heeft is een tablet, laptop of smartphone. Hierop installeert u onze app en de rest wijst zich vanzelf.\r\nSnel contact\r\nBent u cliënt en heeft u een vraag aan uw zorgverlener? Of bent u zorgverlener en wilt u informeren hoe het met uw cliënt gaat? Wilt u graag vrijwilligerswerk doen? Of bent u groot fan van gadgets en wilt u zelf bepalen wie de voordeur mag openen of de lampen mag bedienen?\r\nVia de iQAN regisseert u al deze zaken zelf, voor uw naaste of voor uw zelf.\r\n\r\nGebruikersvriendelijk\r\nDeze app is al vanaf 2010 dagelijks in gebruik, de software is hiermee doorontwikkeld en betrouwbaar, maar ook erg gebruiksvriendelijk. Het ontwerp is afgestemd op de wensen van de zorgorganisatie die met de app werkt en heeft hierdoor veel verschijningsvormen.\r\n\r\nEnkele voordelen:\r\n- Eenvoudig in gebruik\r\n- Eenvoudig te installeren\r\n- Al uw vrienden, familie en zorgverleners altijd dichtbij\r\n- Reeds jaren in gebruik door een grote populatie gebruikers\r\n- Verminderd het sociale isolement\r\n- Creëert een groter gevoel van veiligheid\r\n- Bevorderd de zelfredzaamheid\r\n- Begeleiding bij medicatie en voedsel inname\r\n- Positieve en informele begeleiding mogelijk"

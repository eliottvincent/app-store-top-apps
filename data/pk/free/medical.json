      "label": "Join the millions of medical professionals who use MDCalc daily to support clinical decision making at the bedside. Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

      "label": "Mobile eLogbook has been designed in co-operation with the elogbook.org FHI Pan-Surgical Electronic Logbook to facilitate completion of your logbook.\n\nOnce you have entered your elogbook.org login credentials, the app will synchronise with the individual account. All operation and hospital codes, your favourite procedures, consultants and hospitals will be retrieved for use with the app to record all the necessary information in a format that will be instantly recognisable from the elogbook.org webpages.\n\n* Offline data entry\n\nYou do not require a Wi-Fi or 3G connection to enter data in to the app. Ideal for environments with poor network signals. A Wi-Fi/3G connection is only required at the time of upload.\n\n* Upload functionality\n\nIn order to upload operations to the elogbook system you will need to subscribe to the upload functionality. When you initially successfully validate your elogbook username and password you will receive a free 28 day trial subscription. Once this expires you will need to purchase a subscription to continue to upload - this can be performed simply within the app.\n\nOnce procedures have been successfully uploaded, they will be deleted from the app. No patient identifiable information will be retained on your device. We recommend uploading data immediately or as soon as a network 3G/Wi-Fi signal is available. If upload is interrupted due to signal loss for example, data not yet uploaded will be retained until a successful upload is achieved.\n\n* Supported specialities\n\nThe following specialties are currently supported, including specialty specific fields, e.g. laparascopic, 30 day mortality, sub-division of roles within procedures etc\n\nCardiothoracic Surgery\nGeneral Surgery\nNeurosurgery\nOpthalmology\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery\nOtolaryngology\nPaediatric Surgery\nPlastic Surgery\nTrauma and Orthopaedic Surgery\nUrology\n\n* Operation and hospital codes\n\nUpon first use, the app will automatically download all operation and hospital codes from the elogbook.org website. As the elogbook.org evolves, changes will be available automatically. Simply “Check for data updates” from within the app settings.\n\n* Favourites and search\n\nThe app will automatically download your favourite operations, hospital and consultants. You can also search through the lists of operations, hospitals and consultants.\n\n* Simplifying data recording\n\nFavourites are available at the push of a button. Search facility allows rapid identification of a particular procedure. Alternatively users can navigate through the operations list, identical to the elogbook.org.\n\nDuplicate fields when performing multiple procedures on the same patient by:\n\n- “Add another procedure on the same patient” prompt. This option can be activated in the settings page\n- Perform a “long press” on any patient record and follow the duplicate fields prompt\n\n* Operation List\n\nSee all your entered operations ordered by date\nPatient ID, operation date and procedure are shown for easy identification\n\n* Security and encryption\n\nMobile eLogbook is protected by a PIN which is stored in the iPhone keychain\n\nPatient data is secured using standard iOS file protection capabilities.\n\nData is uploaded to the elogbook.org servers over a secure HTTPS connection (the same encryption that is used when logging in to the elogbook.org website)"

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

You'll also get the latest health advice.\n \nAvailable in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.\n\nThe app can be used when travelling across England, Wales, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), and alerting them if they have been in contact with someone who later reported a positive test result in the app.\n\nThe app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.\n\nThe app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended)."

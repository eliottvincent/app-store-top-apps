We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

      "label": "-The Multiplier App automates calculations to predict mature height and bone length in children. This method was created originally in Baltimore at the University of Maryland, and subsequently developed at the International Center for Limb Lengthening (ICLL), Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics (RIAO), Sinai Hospital of Baltimore.\n\n\n-We have taught the Multiplier Method for more than 19 years at our annual Baltimore Limb Deformity Course (www.DeformityCourse.com). These calculations are typically performed by hand, using various formulae. Certain calculations are easy, but others involve more complicated formulae. Utilizing this app will reduce the time needed for these routine calculations and decrease errors. You need only input certain data (sex, age, length) and the app will calculate the answer by using the appropriate Multiplier formula.\n\n\nThe Multiplier App will allow you to make the following calculations:\n\n• Lower Extremity\n- Limb Length Discrepancy (LLD) (Congenital)\n- LLD (Developmental)\n- Growth Remaining\n- Bone Length\n- Timing of Angular Correction\n- Timing of Epiphysiodesis\n- Comprehensive (Congenital) LLD and Epiphysiodesis\n-Scanogram Calculations (calculates femur/tibia lengths, overall limb length discrepancy, and amount/side of femur/tibia discrepancies)\n\n• Upper Extremity\n- LLD (Congenital)\n- LLD (Developmental)\n- Growth Remaining\n- Bone Length\n\n• Height and CDC Growth Charts (calculates height at maturity, calculates height at every age, and plots the patient’s height and weight on the CDC growth charts)\n\n• Achondroplasia\n- Height\n- Sitting Height\n- Leg Length\n\n• Fetus (calculates the length of tibia or femur at birth and maturity)\n\n• Foot\n- Foot Length\n- Foot Length Discrepancy\n\n• Spine (calculates sitting height at maturity)\n\n• Oblique Plane Deformity (calculates magnitude, orientation, and direction of an oblique plane deformity)\n\n• Inclined Osteotomy (calculates the rotational orientation and the vertical inclination of the osteotomy)\n\nThis app also provides the following additional resources:\n-Bone Age: Elbow and Hand (shows how to determine skeletal age by using radiographs of the elbow or hand)\n-Figures that show the standard measurements for the lower limb and foot\n-The multiplier formulae that the app uses to perform the calculations\n-Tables that show the multiplier values that are used in the formulae\n-Figures that show the Solomin Foot Analysis (deformity correction planning for the midfoot, hindfoot, and ankle using reference lines and angles provided by Dr. Leonid Solomin)\n-Figures that show the development of the apophyses, epiphyses, and bones\n-Bibliography\n-User guide\n\n\nDisclaimer: No growth prediction method is 100% accurate; this App is not a substitute for sound and careful clinical judgment.\nPrivacy Policy: We respect the privacy of the people who use International Center for Limb Lengthening apps. The Multiplier app does not collect, use or distribute any data from the users."

Colour-coded icons allow easy navigation to content sections. \n\nSupporting information on how to prescribe antibiotics appropriately is provided in an introductory section then subsequent sections cover antimicrobial treatment recommendations for a range of infections from commonly encountered respiratory tract infections to severe sepsis and management of complex infections in patients with haematological conditions.   \n\nOther features include evidence-based guidelines on antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgical procedures including interventional radiological procedures. Antibiotic dosing guides including in renally-impaired, obese or pregnant patients are also included.\n\nThis app was developed by MEG Support Tools. The MEG Guidelines system provides a way for clinicians to deliver their guidelines, protocols and clinical practice guides to staff members on their own mobile devices.

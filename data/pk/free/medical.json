They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves.

      "label": "Goli pharmacy is specialized in delivering genuine monthly medicines and health products for maintaining quality of life at the best value across Pakistan. \n\nGoli is an online pharmacy platform (marketplace) where you can purchase medicines online that serves patients with chronic needs by providing a better experience between the patient (consumer) and pharmacies. \n\nWe believe that the needs of a person who takes medicines everyday over a long period of time (chronic) to maintain certain aspects of their health are different then the needs of a person who has been prescribed medication for 5-7 days (acute) to a couple of weeks. \n\nWe have experienced chronic care management in countries with exceptional resources that have nearly universal health insurance coverage for outpatients, as well as countries with comparably lower healthcare standards where even the fraction of people who are able to pay for their own medicines to maintain their health are unable to do so. We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

You can also read concise explanations of how each abnormality manifests itself in ECG findings. The ability to view these ECG recordings as often as desired makes this a valuable tool for mastering the nuances of ECG interpretation.\n\nCustomer reviews:\nThese apps have really been improving since recent updates. They are not designed as standalone tutorials, but rather serve as an excellent and extensive library of realistic example cases that illustrate principles of ECG interpretation, from the simplest to the very complex, and from the common to the very rare.

Meet ECG Basics, your go to app to learn the concepts of this ever challenging subject.\n\nThis app is organised into various sections - starting from basic concepts moving towards more advanced topics.\n\nInitial sections introduces you to calculate rate, analysing rhythm, and cardiac axis. Also you will learn about the waves - how they are generated and their morphology. \n\nSubsequent sections are organised in to topic wise not limiting to rhythm disturbances, bundle branch blocks, conduction disturbances, cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias, stress testing (TMT), Pediatric ECG, Pacemaker ECGs, electrolyte disturbances.\n\nThis app sort of works like an ECG atlas so that you can refer to specific electrocardiogram in emergency. \n\nElectrocardiography and electrocardiogram interpretation is must for any cardiologist and this topic is to be mastered in cardiology.\n\nThe free version does not include some chapters (which are not very essential, but more important to someone looking for advanced learning) and it contains ads. Purchase the pro version to gain mastery over electrocardiography.\n\nThis app is most useful for people looking for basic concepts (consider it as ECG for dummies) like medical students, paramedical staff, nurses, physiotherapists. But people who already mastered electrocardiography can also have look back into basics. \n\nLook out for the companion app, ECG flashcards by us in AppStore for rapid review of ECGs.\n\nIn future updates, we are planning to challenge you with pro features like self assessment so that you can evaluate yourself what you have learnt.\n\nPlease do post a positive review if you like the app. It means a lot for us.

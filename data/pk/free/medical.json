Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings.

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

Measure your stress to manage it!\n\n- What is the principle behind StressScan? − \nMany of the functions essential to maintaining human health are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is medically recognized that the balance of the autonomic nervous system can become disordered through fatigue and other stress, stemming from causes such as work and human relationships. By analyzing the waveform of your heartbeat as measured at the fingertip, StressScan can analyze the balance of your autonomic nervous system and measure your stress level on a stress index of 1 to 100.\n\n- You can trust StressScan! - \nThe technology used by StressScan is based on heart rate variability analysis, which is widely recognized in the field of heart rate analysis and autonomic nervous system research. \nAlthough heart rate variability analysis technology is not yet generally well known, many medical institutions and companies have taken an interest and are beginning to put it to use. The technology is seeing use even at the cutting edge of stress care, including adoption by the US military to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers returning from the battlefield, and by NASA for astronaut training and health management.\n\n- Usable in a range of scenarios! - \n· Periodic checking of daily stress level\n· Checking the effects of favorite meals and drinks on stress\n· Checking relaxation while traveling or at a favorite spot\n\n- Device compatibility -\nThe app is intended for use with a camera- and flash-equipped smartphone. It is not usable with devices that do not have a camera and flash.\n\n- Usage environment -\nAn Internet connection is required to use the app. External support for measurement functions is used for complex stress analysis."

Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves.

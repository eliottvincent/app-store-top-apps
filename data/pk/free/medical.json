      "label": "Cardian allows you to track your heart health by spending JUST 6 minutes weekly! It is even easier now with a dedicated Apple Watch app. The method we use is called Active Orthostatic Test.\n\nThe tracking method is very simple - you are going to measure your lying and standing heart rates.\n• In the first phase you will lie for 5 minutes and then measure your heart rate.\n• In the second phase you will stand for 1 minute and then measure your heart rate\n\nGenerally, the lower the difference between lying and standing heart rates the better your overall heart health. Approximate ranges (please note this is not a diagnose, if you are feeling bad contact your doctor):\n• [0 - 15] Great heart health.\n• [16 - 25] Normal heart health.\n• [25+] Bad heart health.\n\nThe key to successful tests is to pass them at the same time of day regularly. You can setup notification preferences to never miss your test.\n\n--------------------\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\n\nCardian reads / writes the following data using the Health app (HealthKit).\n\nApple Watch App:\n\n- Heart Rate (Read / Write)\n- Workouts (Write)\n\n--------------------\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lfffp8ayg95pa4x/cardian_privacy_policy.pdf?dl=0\nTerms of service: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qu72a2a5a35jgqk/cardian_terms.pdf?dl=0\n\n--------------------\n\nDisclaimer:\nYOU MUST NEVER RELY ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED USING THIS APP FOR ANY DIAGNOSIS OR RECOMMENDATION FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT.

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

We understand there is a huge gap in the way people with chronic needs are served in our country even though the resources are available.\n\nWe believe in incremental improvements; we believe in being a little bit better everyday and we have designed our services with these principles in mind. We are working tirelessly to improving our own efficiencies as well as the our services for the following outcomes:\n- Improved patient journey.\n- Reduced medication errors.\n- Improved compliance.\n- Better concordance.\n- International travel facilitation.\n- Reduction in hospital admissions.\n- Reduction in readmissions due to medication errors.\n\nWe help the healthcare industry plan and create future capacity, reduce the overall systemic cost, understand health trends and build partnerships that improve the quality of lives of millions with better outcomes."

Join our community and connect with hundreds of thousands of verified doctors, healthcare professionals and medical students sharing knowledge and learning from each other in a secure private network.\n\nMedShr’s Awards include: Facebook App of the Year for Social Good Award; The Evening Standard Startup of the Year 2018; and a World Summit Award from the United Nations.\n\nThe app has been featured on the BBC, Sky News, The Evening Standard, The Telegraph and Metro News.\n\n“A revolution in the way Medical Knowledge spreads” *****\n- Dr Tzalamouras Basilis, Interventional Cardiology Fellow\n\nDISCOVER AND DISCUSS MEDICAL CASES & IMAGES\n\nFrom ECGs, scans and X-rays to patient photos and videos, MedShr helps you find and discuss relevant medical cases with colleagues, by specialty and at all grades. MedShr is a totally secure, private network and features an easy to use in-app patient consent form and system for anonymising images. Follow clinical cases you find interesting and learn from your peers with informal and accredited case based discussion.\n\nSHARE KNOWLEDGE WITH VERIFIED MEMBERS\n\nMedShr is the simple way to capture, share and discuss clinical images and videos in your everyday practice. Create a case, obtain consent and start a discussion securely from your mobile. Send medical cases to colleagues, share them with the wider community, export to your e-portfolio or simply organise cases for your personal records. MedShr is safe, secure and enables you to maintain complete control over the privacy of your cases - with all members being 100% verified as doctors, healthcare professionals and medical students.\n\nEXPAND YOUR PROFESSIONAL NETWORK\n\nMedical students and doctors of all levels are joining MedShr to advance their learning as they connect with peers from their university, place of work and across the world. Connect and follow specialists in your field to keep up to date on their latest cases, techniques and learnings. Join groups to learn from others, share findings or just converse around complex and interesting clinical cases. Medical students, junior doctors and specialist trainees use MedShr groups as a resource for informal learning, ahead of case-based examinations and as an aid to formal learning.\n\nMESSAGE CONNECTIONS AND COLLEAGUES\n\nMedShr Messaging allows you to message your connections about anything from arranging to meet at a conference to sharing a link to an interesting case. To get started, tap the message bubble in the top right-hand corner of the home feed to start a new chat. Use MedShr Messaging to reach out to colleagues and build your network.\n\nOBTAIN CPD CREDITS AND SHOW PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nThere are opportunities to learn from and reflect on cases every day. MedShr now makes it easy to request Continuing Professional Development (CPD) credits for each case that you share on MedShr. The simple process makes it easy to receive CPD credit and keep a record of your learning on the go.\n\nHELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THOSE IN NEED\n\nOur community is providing medics in crisis zones and doctors in developing countries with quick access to second and specialist medical opinions so that they can make critical clinical decisions. With your participation, you can collaborate with like-minded professionals and be part of a new frontier in medical education.\n\n“MedShr is a brilliant idea - smartphones connect doctors, making it possible for aid workers to get an instant medical diagnosis” ***** - Rohan Silver, Evening Standard\n\nFor support, suggestions and feedback, please contact us at info@medshr.net"

      "label": "This application is designed for professional dentists who want to advise their patients more effectively. A large collection of 3D illustrations of dental treatment is sorted into groups and located inside this application.\n\nQuick and easy. Many dentists draw illustrations on paper every time explaining the treatment process to their patients, which can take some time. Finding the necessary illustration in the application database is very simple- it will take you about 10 seconds. \n\nThe 3D illustration is better than a photo. Patients can be shocked and frightened by seeing photographs of blood operations or a real photo of teeth.  If you use 3D illustrations, the patient most likely will perceive such information loyally.\n\nQuality and precision. All illustrations are based on accurate anatomy, real procedures, and treatment, based on the support of professional doctors and dental surgeons. \n\nAccess to the necessary illustrations will be instant regardless of where you are. This application does not use the Internet traffic to download the illustrations, all necessary 3D illustration files are already contained within the application.\n \nThe category of selected illustration topics allows you to access the most frequently used topics even faster. To do this, you will need to transfer the necessary topic to the Favorites section.\n\nThe list of topics by category:\nAnatomy of teeth and jaws. Information schemes. \nHygiene and teeth whitening. The development of tartar and plaque. Cleaning.  \nTherapy- dental treatment. Different types of caries. \nProsthetics. Veneers, Restorations, Bridges, Crowns, Removable prostheses.\nImplantation. Bone Augmentation. Partial and complete rehabilitation of teeth.  \nOrthodontics. Braces, Occlusion, Congenital and acquired defects.\nPeriodontology. Various gum problems and their treatment.\nSurgery. Extractions, Hemisection, Sinus-lifting, Bone Augmentation.  \n\n\nThe gallery works on the principle of the slideshow presentation. You open a topic you are interested in, the topic itself can contain 3-10 images. You choose the most suitable illustration and show to the patient and consult him. Next, you can switch the related images from the topic while you continue to consult."

      "label": "IAM Medical Guidelines helps Canadian medical professionals become more familiar with a curated selection of the many Clinical Practice Guidelines they are increasingly expected to know about. We currently have guidelines for Asthma, COPD, Breast Cancer Recovery for primary care and patients, genetic screening, deprescribing of BZRAs, CHEIs, memantine, PPIs, AHGs and antipsychotics, and Shared Decision Making for Abdominal Aortic Aneurism, Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Cancer of the Colon, Lung Cancer and Prostate Cancer, with more to come!\n\nIAM is a single container for these Guidelines; we started with an accredited program in partnership with the Canadian Thoracic Society and their 2012 Guideline Update: Diagnosis and Management of Asthma in Preschoolers, Children and Adults. This has been followed with recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of Asthma in preschoolers (2015), Severe Asthma Guidelines (2017) and COPD (2017).\n\nThe app also includes Breast Cancer Survivorship guidelines deriving from the work of Marian Luctkar-Flude RN PhD, Alice Aiken PhD, Mary Ann McColl PhD, Joan Tranmer RN PhD and Hugh Langley MD CCFP, published in Canadian Family Physician (Le Médecin de famille canadien) Vol 61: november 2015. These key guideline recommendations for post-treatment breast cancer care were synthesized from existing guidelines produced by credible cancer care and primary care organizations, and align with the most recent guidelines published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the American Cancer Society in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Vol 34(6): 2016. \n\nNotably, we include Breast Cancer Recovery guidelines for Breast Cancer survivors; this is the same information as in Breast Cancer Survivorship, but presented for non-medical professionals.\n\nA more recent addition is GEC-KO, a channel published by Genetics Education Canada whose mandate is to increase genetics literacy in health care professionals and thereby enhance quality of care in order to optimize the health and well-being of Canadians.\n\nThe most recent channel is Deprescribing, a Decision Support application applying the methods and algorithms developed by Dr. Barb Farrell and Dr. Cara Tannenbaum and their collaborators. See https://deprescribing.org.\n\nWe simplify study by:\n•\tFeaturing only guidelines published by recognized authorities\n•\tSelecting the recommendations most important to the intended audience of each guideline, using a Delphi process\n•\tWorking with guideline authors to condense each recommendation for easy scanning on the “Topics” page\n•\tUsing Push Notification to gently highlight a different recommendation each week\n•\tPresenting each recommendation at three levels; Topics (searchable list of condensed recommendations), Recommendation (the full monte) and Guideline (the recommendation shown in context in the full guideline)\n•\tOptimizing the guideline for easy reading on small devices, while maintaining access to the full original content\n\nWe encourage study by:\n•\tPromoting reflective learning, using ITPCRG’s research-proven Information Assessment Method (https://www.mcgill.ca/iam/home-page); for each recommendation, a short questionnaire encourages reflection on how the information could be valuable to the practitioner.\n\nAll the app content is stored on our servers and downloaded to your device when you add a new channel, so you can study anywhere – the subway, in-flight, at the cottage…  As new guidelines are added, they will become available for download, and corrections and updates to existing guidelines will be incorporated seamlessly. The app keeps itself up-to-date.\n\nOur goal is to become a one-stop shop for Medical Guidelines, so that you only need to invest your valuable time (and iPhone homepage real estate) in a single app, rather than downloading and learning about a separate app for each guideline."

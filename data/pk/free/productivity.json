Zero-log policy, traffic encryption, IP and DNS masking. These all mean that third parties are not able to monitor you any longer, and that your privacy is reliably secured from obtrusive website and ISP surveillance.\n\n+70 LOCATIONS\nOur high-speed VPN servers in 70+ locations all over the globe, as well as our enhanced KeepSolid Wise technology, allow you to freely surf the web without giving out a single piece of your personal information, including your current location. Don’t let websites discriminate you based on the way you surf the internet or the place you browse it from.\n\nTOTAL SECURITY\nWe offers a variety of VPN protocols, each with unique capabilities and strengths. Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. All costs for subscriptions are mentioned above.\n\nPrivacy policies : https://luni.app/support/vpn_privacy\nTerms of use : https://luni.app/support/vpn_terms\n\nDisclaimer: We have had reports that our VPN service might be blocked in the countries listed below:\n- China\n- UAE\n- Saudi Arabia\n- Iraq\n- Iran\n- Turkmenistan\n- Turkey\n\nWhile we can’t say that it’s totally impossible to connect in the mentioned locations, there are a few challenges to overcome."

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

      "label": "Hello VPN is a private and secure VPN service with remarkable features. “VPN and proxy server companies are all the same” we can hear you saying. Actually it’s not always that simple. Hello VPN never ever keeps user logs, as it believes in absolute user privacy and internet freedom. Although a lot of VPN companies claim to have such a motto, it is not always the case, because of the binding regulations and laws some VPN companies are subject to.\n\nThat’s right, some countries may be subject to regulations of intelligence alliances like The Five Eyes (FVEY), The Nine Eyes, and The Fourteen Eyes Alliances. Although there is nothing wrong with that, having a company headquarter based in alliance countries may result in an obligation to keep user logs on a regular basis, contrary to the promise made to you by some VPN or proxy server companies! \n\nFortunately there are still light-side of the force VPN and proxy server companies abiding by their word, hence keeping no user logs! As you may have already guessed, Hello VPN is one of them. Thanks to Hello VPN being an Estonia based VPN service, such binding regulations and laws are not applicable to Hello VPN.\n\nNo doubt there are many reasons to use a VPN or a proxy server e.g. ultimate privacy, boosting gaming performance by means of a stable connection, accessing services available for only specific locations, fast video streaming, WiFi security, anonymous browsing aka incognito mode etc. No matter the motivation behind, you are all set with Hello VPN! Variety of VPN servers are optimized for different use cases!\n\nDid Hello VPN begin to appeal to you? The word “Hello” stands as a way of greeting to the free internet, and the word VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. Keeping your private information private, and keeping prying eyes away is the essential goal of Hello VPN. \n\nHow does Hello VPN work? HelloVPN works by routing your Apple device’s connection through private servers of HelloVPN rather than your internet service provider (ISP) directly, so that when your data is sent to the internet, it comes from the HelloVPN servers. That’s right, HelloVPN creates a private tunnel from your device to the internet, and basically hides your data through encryption.\n\n“But what are the proxy servers?” is a frequently asked question to our customer support. A proxy server is also a system that provides a gateway between users and the internet. “What is the difference between a VPN and a proxy server then?” occurs to be a common follow-up question. The main difference between a VPN and a proxy server is encryption. VPNs hide all your web activity, such as all the apps you use, websites you visit, using encryption. Proxy servers on the other hand, will only change your IP address on a specific session or on a specific app, but they won’t encrypt all your online activities. In other words, a VPN secures all your network traffic, while a proxy server works on an application level. A proxy server is also relatively suitable for browsing the internet, but it’s not as safe and secure as a VPN.\n\n“Is Hello VPN free?” You can get your secure VPN connection completely free by watching in-app advertisements within Hello VPN’s basic mode. You can also upgrade to premium mode anytime to remove in-app ads, and also to access all the extra network features. \n\nAbout Hello VPN Premium Subscription:\n\n*The subscription covers VPN usage.\n*Hello VPN subscription period alternatives are 1 week, 1 month and 1 year. \n*Based on your plan every 1 week or 1 month or 1 year your VPN subscription renews. \n*Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at only your confirmation.\n*Hello VPN subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off.\n\nYou can cancel your Hello VPN subscription anytime via this URL:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039\n\nHello VPN’s terms of use can be found via this URL on Hello VPN’s official website:\nhttps://www.hellovpn.app/en/terms-of-use"

No problem: stay up-to-date with our detailed live text commentary.\n• LINE-UPS AND HEAD-TO-HEAD: Do you need to know the line-ups before the match starts? We have them in advance. And also the head-to-head history so you can check how both teams have played against each other in the past.\n• LIVE TABLES: One goal can change a lot. Our live tables will show you if a scored goal has changed the league ranking, as well as the current top scorers table.\n• MATCH PREVIEWS AND RECAPS: Stats are important, but they don't tell everything. This is why you can find a detailed preview for every match in the most popular leagues - and also the post-match reports.\n\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES\n\nLength of this subscription is 1 year.

      "label": "WebCricket is a free cricket scoring application which also has the fantastic feature of live online scoring! It is the most widely used electronic scoring system amongst schools and clubs in South Africa, a major cricket playing nation.\n\nThe WebCricket system has the following major features:\n\n     1.\tUser-friendly electronic scoring system to simplify the old book scoring method\n     2.\tLive online scoring for your community to follow the game in real time (www.websports.co.za)\n     3.\tEvent List tracking which allows you to go back to any point in the game to edit errors made while scoring\n     4.\tDetailed statistical analysis which has proven to be an essential coaching tool for player development\n     5.\tExtensive help files to guide you along should you require any assistance during the scoring process\n     6.\tThe development of the WebSports Notification app, which will send a notification to your device when a wicket falls, player reaches 50 etc. \n\nFeedback from the current users is that the WebCricket system is extremely user-friendly! Simply register after you download, add your ‘Venues’, ‘Teams’ and ‘Players’ and then get going by starting a ‘New Game’. For help, simply click on the ‘Help’ menu icon from any screen to get routed to the help section for that particular screen.\n\nAs we have seen in South Africa, live online scoring has become an extremely valuable feature of the WebCricket system. With our busy schedules these days, and with so much cricket being played during the week, it is impossible for parents to always be at the games due to work or other commitments. Live scoring allows them the opportunity to follow the game in real time with ball-by-ball updates so that they don’t miss any of the action!\n\nAnother major development has been the creation of the WebSports Notification app. It is a free download which allows you to follow any registered team using the WebCricket system. It sends you a notification as soon as a main event happens in a game (Wicket falls, player reaches 50 etc.). It is a wonderful tool for users who cannot always follow the action on the WebCricket site at all times, but would like to know immediately when something happens in the game. Note: Please email help@cobitech.co.za to get your team registered for the WebSports app. The app is available on the Apple Store.\n\nWe have no doubt that you will all thoroughly enjoy your scoring experience with the WebCricket app. For any queries, please don’t hesitate to email us as at help@cobitech.co.za."

We generate a variety of analytics like 3D ball trajectory, pitchmaps, ball-by-ball video organization, and more! The phone is simply placed on a tripod at the beginning of a session, pointed at the sporting environment and we take care of the rest. Recorded video and data is then stored in the cloud, making it available to other phones - for other players, coaches, referees, friends and family to view with ease!"

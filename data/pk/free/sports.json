We generate a variety of analytics like 3D ball trajectory, pitchmaps, ball-by-ball video organization, and more! The phone is simply placed on a tripod at the beginning of a session, pointed at the sporting environment and we take care of the rest. Recorded video and data is then stored in the cloud, making it available to other phones - for other players, coaches, referees, friends and family to view with ease!"

Capture, Analyse, and Share your successes with friends - for free!\r\n\r\nThis Application enables you to get down to the nets and immediately gather some valuable insights around your bowling with your friends.\r\n\r\nImportant Tips around setting up the device (see training video):\r\n\r\n1. Use AR feature built into the app which will help calibrate your phone - the perfect position is 2m behind the stumps and 150cm in height\r\n\r\n2. Aligning the AR stumps up at both ends will ensure the phone is set up in the perfect position to capture your personal analytics\r\n\r\n3. Invite friends to join the net session and tag deliveries to their profile\r\n\r\n4. Press the Record button to start the video when the bowler is in their delivery stride and again as it reaches the end of the net - This will ensure the video has been captured in full\r\n\r\n5. Visit your activities screen to analyse your results and share the results through the main social streams\r\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing how you get on and please reach out to us with any feedback as we are constantly looking to improve the experience of the app."

      "label": "The Cricket Scorebook App takes a simple approach to scoring cricket. Not only that, we have features that help with coaching and improving player performance.\n\nFeatures for Coaches:\n* Dot ball counter - encourage kids and junior cricketers to rotate the strike to keep the scoreboard ticking\n* Most common dismissals for each batter. You can analyse each batter and find the common dismissal type - i.e. you might find a batter is always caught-out. You can then coach them techniques to reduce the ball being hit the air.\n* and many more coach analysis tools including total wides bowled, total strike rate, etc\n\nFeatures for Scorers:\n* Do you sometimes forget to score a ball? We have a smart reminder system that will vibrate your phone if you forget to score a ball. Never forget to score a ball again!\n* Ability to score negative runs instead of a wicket (perfect for kids cricket!)\n* Ability to score a wide and NOT count as an extra ball in the over (perfect for kids cricket!)\n* and many more features to make score easy - including allowing a batter to bat twice in one innings, undo a wrong score, etc\n\nStats include:\nBatting Average\nHighest Score\nTotal Runs\nStrike Rate\nTotal Innings Batted\nTotal Outs\nTotal Sixes\nTotal Fours\nTotal Dots\nTotal Balls faced\nTotal times dismissed bowled\nTotal times dismissed caught\nand MANY MORE STATS!!\n\n\nExciting 'fresh' design.\nEvery cricket scorebook looks the same. Not true! We have designed our app differently! \n\nNo longer is the design boring. Instead of showing the batter list while you score, we show coaching suggestions, live stats, current partnership, total innings dot-balls/scoring shots, and other helpful cricket tips.\n\nWho is this app for?\n\nIf you are scoring or coaching kids cricket, youth cricket, social cricket, indoor cricket, gully cricket or backyard cricket - this app is for you. It keeps things simple, makes scoring fun, and is completely FREE (in-app purchase available for stats).\n\nWho is this app not for?\n\nIf you are a senior cricketer, or play in a competitive grade - we suggest looking at an app that is built specifically for enhanced scoring & statistics (note: another advantage of our app is that it is free! Other enhanced Cricket scoring apps do have a cost).\n\nDownload today!\nThis app is built for ease-of-use for kids, youth & social cricket. And for coaches who want live in-play suggestions to help improve batting & bowling.\n\nThere has never been a Cricket Scorebook App built for Kids, Youth or social cricket… until this one launched! Download for FREE today.\n\nThis app has been developed by cricketers, cricket coaches, kids cricket scorers and kid cricket umpires. Made for all cricketers, by cricketers!\n\nWe don't like cricket, we love it!\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

CricScore’s unique features provide a smooth and pleasant user experience.  \n\nKey Features:\n-\tFree app, no ads present, no subscription required\n-\tThe opponent team does not need to use this app for you to score your batting innings\n-\tCreate teams without requiring an email address/phone number of each team member\n-\tAdd all the team members in a single click\n-\tPrivate PIN for each team to avoid random teams playing against your team\n-\tShowing the next spell bowler at the top at the end of the over\n-\tTemporarily skip sign-in and connect your email address later.\n\nCricScore app allows you to create a team efficiently add all team members in one attempt, which saves time by avoiding adding each team member individually.\n\nYour opponent team does not need to use this app for you to score your batting innings as there is an option to play against a sample team (created by CricScore). You can play against any opponent in the world as long as you have their team name and their team’s private PIN. Each team's private PIN prevents other teams from scoring against your team without your knowledge. Each team can update scoring from their mobiles without sharing the same account – changes will be live and available on each individual’s respective mobiles.\n\nWhile choosing the next bowler to bowl, CricScore shows the next spell bowler who can potentially continue at the top. CricScore also shows every other bowlers’ stats while choosing the next bowler to bowl. \n\nCricScore needs only the email address of the team’s administrator to create an account to sign in to the app. CricScore does not require other team members' phone numbers/email addresses to create a team.\n\nThere is an option for users to sign in anonymously without an email. Later, an email can be linked to the anonymous account. The anonymous user can still use all the signed-in user's features. However, CricScore does not recommend this option as the user will lose all their team's information, scores, and other data when they delete the app from their phone.\n\nCricscore’s founder created this app single-handedly in his free time to help cricket lovers everywhere enjoy the game more. Please let us know your feedback and suggestions by emailing support@cricscore.net."

The 4dot6 cricket umpire run counter app will vibrate to remind when you have forgotten to score a ball.\n\nHow?\n\nThe app calculates the average time between balls - and when this time has gone over by 33% - we remind you with a slight vibrate. Now all you need to do is workout if the ball was pitching outside leg stump...\n\n\nHighest partnership\n\nAllow the app to assist with coaching by viewing the highest partnership, average partnership and current partnership. With this info you can encourage the batsman to bat a long innings to build large partnerships.\n\n\nCricket Umpires\n\nTime to update to the latest cricket umpire run counter. Everything you need to make sure you are accurately counting and scoring each ball.\n\n\nCricket Coaches\n\nInstall the latest cricket umpire over and ball counter to allow you to help coach your players to bat longer innings. The Total Dot Balls feature is a great tool to help encourage batsman to rotate the strike to keep the scoreboard ticking over.\n\n\nCricket Players\n\nAre you looking to get on the good side of your regular cricket umpire? Install this app on your umpires phone and you’ll be shown the ‘going down leg’ gesture for your next few innings!"

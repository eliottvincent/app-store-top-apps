CricScore’s unique features provide a smooth and pleasant user experience.  \n\nKey Features:\n-\tFree app, no ads present, no subscription required\n-\tThe opponent team does not need to use this app for you to score your batting innings\n-\tCreate teams without requiring an email address/phone number of each team member\n-\tAdd all the team members in a single click\n-\tPrivate PIN for each team to avoid random teams playing against your team\n-\tShowing the next spell bowler at the top at the end of the over\n-\tTemporarily skip sign-in and connect your email address later.\n\nCricScore app allows you to create a team efficiently add all team members in one attempt, which saves time by avoiding adding each team member individually.\n\nYour opponent team does not need to use this app for you to score your batting innings as there is an option to play against a sample team (created by CricScore). You can play against any opponent in the world as long as you have their team name and their team’s private PIN. Each team's private PIN prevents other teams from scoring against your team without your knowledge. Each team can update scoring from their mobiles without sharing the same account – changes will be live and available on each individual’s respective mobiles.\n\nWhile choosing the next bowler to bowl, CricScore shows the next spell bowler who can potentially continue at the top. CricScore also shows every other bowlers’ stats while choosing the next bowler to bowl. \n\nCricScore needs only the email address of the team’s administrator to create an account to sign in to the app. CricScore does not require other team members' phone numbers/email addresses to create a team.\n\nThere is an option for users to sign in anonymously without an email. Later, an email can be linked to the anonymous account. The anonymous user can still use all the signed-in user's features. However, CricScore does not recommend this option as the user will lose all their team's information, scores, and other data when they delete the app from their phone.\n\nCricscore’s founder created this app single-handedly in his free time to help cricket lovers everywhere enjoy the game more. Please let us know your feedback and suggestions by emailing support@cricscore.net."

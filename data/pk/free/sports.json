The application features similar functionality to the website with a design made for mobile devices. iOS users can access the FEI Equine Prohibited Substances Database from the palm of their hand. The application requires that users connect to the internet through cellular or Wi-Fi network.\n\nThe purpose of the FEI Prohibited Substances Database is to make a clear distinction between the use of routine, legitimate medication and deliberate and calculated doping to affect a horse’s performance; the FEI has published guidelines to assist treating and team veterinarians. Inappropriate use of substances is also a threat to the health and welfare of the horse. The purpose of this database is to help you identify prohibited substances under FEI regulations. Information such as substance definition, common usage and common trade names are available.\n\nYou must be aware that the list of trade names is not exhaustive but it reflects the most common trade names in various countries. The trade names used may be different in your country. Therefore it is imperative you always use the database to check for active substances rather than trade names. Although the FEI has taken all reasonable care that the information contained within the website and mobile application is accurate at the time of publication, no representation or guarantee (including liability towards third parties), expressed or implied, is made as to its accuracy, reliability or completeness."

A useful reference for judges and spectators. Study FEI dressage tests with a more visual and auditory learning approach. Each test allows you to:\n\n• Read the test instructions along with the marking criteria\n• Review dressage arena diagrams that animate through the movements within a test\n• Play and record your own readings of the test that are perfectly timed for the individual horses and the arena in which you are practicing\n• Reference and print the official FEI dressage test score sheet to see how judges will mark the users performance\n• Understand the rules for dressage events as PDFs of related rule books are provided for reference on topics such as movement definitions, competition rules, dress attire, judging and veterinary inspection\n• Practice your dressage test by sketching out the movements\n• Keep up-to-date on the latest in dressage competition through the FEI news feed\n\nTo see a full listing of related applications, search for \"federation equestre internationale\" on the App Store.\n\nNote: diagrams are an indication only and should always be used in conjunction with the official FEI test sheets which take precedence."

CricScore’s unique features provide a smooth and pleasant user experience.  \n\nKey Features:\n-\tFree app, no ads present, no subscription required\n-\tThe opponent team does not need to use this app for you to score your batting innings\n-\tCreate teams without requiring an email address/phone number of each team member\n-\tAdd all the team members in a single click\n-\tPrivate PIN for each team to avoid random teams playing against your team\n-\tShowing the next spell bowler at the top at the end of the over\n-\tTemporarily skip sign-in and connect your email address later.\n\nCricScore app allows you to create a team efficiently add all team members in one attempt, which saves time by avoiding adding each team member individually.\n\nYour opponent team does not need to use this app for you to score your batting innings as there is an option to play against a sample team (created by CricScore). You can play against any opponent in the world as long as you have their team name and their team’s private PIN. Each team's private PIN prevents other teams from scoring against your team without your knowledge. Each team can update scoring from their mobiles without sharing the same account – changes will be live and available on each individual’s respective mobiles.\n\nWhile choosing the next bowler to bowl, CricScore shows the next spell bowler who can potentially continue at the top. CricScore also shows every other bowlers’ stats while choosing the next bowler to bowl. \n\nCricScore needs only the email address of the team’s administrator to create an account to sign in to the app. CricScore does not require other team members' phone numbers/email addresses to create a team.\n\nThere is an option for users to sign in anonymously without an email. Later, an email can be linked to the anonymous account. The anonymous user can still use all the signed-in user's features. However, CricScore does not recommend this option as the user will lose all their team's information, scores, and other data when they delete the app from their phone.\n\nCricscore’s founder created this app single-handedly in his free time to help cricket lovers everywhere enjoy the game more. Please let us know your feedback and suggestions by emailing support@cricscore.net."

With articles, pictures, diagrams, image galleries, videos and maps this is the only teaching aid and reference source on fly fishing you will ever need! Rods, reels, lines, leaders, knots, accessories, bank fishing, boat fishing, casting, fly tying - it's all here!\nIt took five years to write and present this work and now I offer it free so you can share all the tips and tricks I learned - tips and tricks which put fish in my bag and trophies on my shelf. This is NOT a game or a toy! But if you are serious about your fly fishing this is the app for you! Download it - explore it - share it with your friends. I guarantee you will find information in here which will leave you saying \"I never thought of that\"!\n\nMost people get out fly fishing once or twice a month if they are lucky and never have the time to discover the techniques I perfected over the years. This app will give you the edge and save you hours of frustration. After all, fly fishing’s meant to be fun... remember? I spent a lot of time and effort trying out different ideas so now you don't need to. I'll tell you how to recognize the best method for a particular time, season and weather conditions.\n\nThere are galleries of flies - so you can see what it looks like when someone mentions a fly you haven't heard of before. There's a section to introduce you to fly tying and dressing - and I'll show you the only three flies you're ever likely to need. I developed them from other patterns and can honestly say that I caught many, many fish using them. I couldn't buy these flies in the shops at the time so I developed some easy ways to tie them for myself and I'll show you how to do that quickly and easily. I even got into the habit of tying up a few flies over a cup of coffee just before I went fishing. That's how easy they are!\n\nThere are maps for major fly fishing countries containing a wealth of information about their fly fishing locations, including a picture of each site and important details such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and relevant websites. The information on these maps is constantly being updated to give you a great reference source for your next fly fishing adventure!\n\nThere's even a section of recipes to help you work out what to do with your fish when you've caught it - everything from a quick snack to a formal dinner!\n\nAnd if you do find this App helpful please leave a comment to help others make up their minds!

      "label": "Players of all levels, including current PGA Tour winners, trust Skillest coaches to improve their game. Skillest can do the same for you.\n\nSkillest is the #1 app for golfers who want to improve their games and lower their handicap.\n\nThe best golf instructors in the world are on Skillest. When you get a lesson on Skillest, you can be confident you’re getting the best instruction possible.\n\nIn person lessons are a great way to learn, but they can get expensive and you may not have access to world-class instructors near you. With Skillest, you know you're getting a great coach and you don't have to meet in person.\n\nSkillest allows you to work on your game at your own speed. Whether it takes a few hours or a few days to practice and master each lesson, Skillest is there for you. Get feedback on your swing anytime you want, from the course, to the driving range, to the comfort of your own home.\n\nHave you ever taken a golf lesson where everything seemed to click, but the results didn't stick a few weeks later? With Skillest you can go back and review your lesson any time you want. If you have questions, just send your coach a message through the app.\n\nWatching golf videos to try to improve doesn't work for most golfers. The best way to improve is to get personalized instruction focused entirely on you and your swing. A Skillest coach can help you understand the best swing for you and will give you personalized drills and feedback to help you reach your goals.\n\nBetween lessons, Skillest makes your practice sessions count. Use the free swing analyzer to record and rewatch your swing. Compare your current swing to your lesson so you can see exactly what you need to work on to improve your game.\n\nWHY IS SKILLEST THE BEST WAY TO LEARN GOLF? BECAUSE YOU CAN:\n* Take a lesson with the best golf instructors in the world.\n* Get a lesson without having to leave your own home.\n* Review every lesson you’ve taken anytime.\n* Record your swing and compare it to your lesson to see your progress.\n* Chat with your coach anytime if you have questions.\n* Learn in real time with a zoom session with your coach.\n* Get a subscription to reduce the cost of your lesson.\n\nDon’t just take our word for it:\n\n\"Using Skillest, in only two years I went from a 20 handicap to competing in tournaments. I live in a remote location, so Skillest allowed me to learn from the best coaches who I otherwise wouldn't have been able to work with for geographic reasons.\"\n– Gregory Gonnet\n\n\"My game has improved dramatically after a year on Skillest. I've gained 20+ yards in distance and improved my consistency, even when under pressure on the course. I also feel I have a clear blueprint for continued improvement”\n – Andrew McDonald\n\n“Ultimately, this is where Skillest’s platform helped me the most… thanks to the constant support provided to me by my subscription, as opposed to a traditional, hour-by-hour approach”\n– James Colgan, Golf.com\n\nThere is no better way to learn golf than Skillest. Download the app for free and check out our incredible selection of coaches. Your handicap will thank you!"

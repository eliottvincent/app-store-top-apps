      "label": "CricScore is a free, simple cricket scoring app without any ads or subscription fees required. CricScore’s unique features provide a smooth and pleasant user experience.  \n\nKey Features:\n-\tFree app, no ads present, no subscription required\n-\tThe opponent team does not need to use this app for you to score your batting innings\n-\tCreate teams without requiring an email address/phone number of each team member\n-\tAdd all the team members in a single click\n-\tPrivate PIN for each team to avoid random teams playing against your team\n-\tShowing the next spell bowler at the top at the end of the over\n-\tTemporarily skip sign-in and connect your email address later.\n\nCricScore app allows you to create a team efficiently add all team members in one attempt, which saves time by avoiding adding each team member individually.\n\nYour opponent team does not need to use this app for you to score your batting innings as there is an option to play against a sample team (created by CricScore). You can play against any opponent in the world as long as you have their team name and their team’s private PIN. Each team's private PIN prevents other teams from scoring against your team without your knowledge. Each team can update scoring from their mobiles without sharing the same account – changes will be live and available on each individual’s respective mobiles.\n\nWhile choosing the next bowler to bowl, CricScore shows the next spell bowler who can potentially continue at the top. CricScore also shows every other bowlers’ stats while choosing the next bowler to bowl. \n\nCricScore needs only the email address of the team’s administrator to create an account to sign in to the app. CricScore does not require other team members' phone numbers/email addresses to create a team.\n\nThere is an option for users to sign in anonymously without an email. Later, an email can be linked to the anonymous account. The anonymous user can still use all the signed-in user's features. However, CricScore does not recommend this option as the user will lose all their team's information, scores, and other data when they delete the app from their phone.\n\nCricscore’s founder created this app single-handedly in his free time to help cricket lovers everywhere enjoy the game more. Please let us know your feedback and suggestions by emailing support@cricscore.net."

      "label": "WebCricket is a free cricket scoring application which also has the fantastic feature of live online scoring! It is the most widely used electronic scoring system amongst schools and clubs in South Africa, a major cricket playing nation.\n\nThe WebCricket system has the following major features:\n\n     1.\tUser-friendly electronic scoring system to simplify the old book scoring method\n     2.\tLive online scoring for your community to follow the game in real time (www.websports.co.za)\n     3.\tEvent List tracking which allows you to go back to any point in the game to edit errors made while scoring\n     4.\tDetailed statistical analysis which has proven to be an essential coaching tool for player development\n     5.\tExtensive help files to guide you along should you require any assistance during the scoring process\n     6.\tThe development of the WebSports Notification app, which will send a notification to your device when a wicket falls, player reaches 50 etc. \n\nFeedback from the current users is that the WebCricket system is extremely user-friendly! Simply register after you download, add your ‘Venues’, ‘Teams’ and ‘Players’ and then get going by starting a ‘New Game’. For help, simply click on the ‘Help’ menu icon from any screen to get routed to the help section for that particular screen.\n\nAs we have seen in South Africa, live online scoring has become an extremely valuable feature of the WebCricket system. With our busy schedules these days, and with so much cricket being played during the week, it is impossible for parents to always be at the games due to work or other commitments. Live scoring allows them the opportunity to follow the game in real time with ball-by-ball updates so that they don’t miss any of the action!\n\nAnother major development has been the creation of the WebSports Notification app. It is a free download which allows you to follow any registered team using the WebCricket system. It sends you a notification as soon as a main event happens in a game (Wicket falls, player reaches 50 etc.). It is a wonderful tool for users who cannot always follow the action on the WebCricket site at all times, but would like to know immediately when something happens in the game. Note: Please email help@cobitech.co.za to get your team registered for the WebSports app. The app is available on the Apple Store.\n\nWe have no doubt that you will all thoroughly enjoy your scoring experience with the WebCricket app. For any queries, please don’t hesitate to email us as at help@cobitech.co.za."

      "label": "The Cricket Scorebook App takes a simple approach to scoring cricket. Not only that, we have features that help with coaching and improving player performance.\n\nFeatures for Coaches:\n* Dot ball counter - encourage kids and junior cricketers to rotate the strike to keep the scoreboard ticking\n* Most common dismissals for each batter. You can analyse each batter and find the common dismissal type - i.e. you might find a batter is always caught-out. You can then coach them techniques to reduce the ball being hit the air.\n* and many more coach analysis tools including total wides bowled, total strike rate, etc\n\nFeatures for Scorers:\n* Do you sometimes forget to score a ball? We have a smart reminder system that will vibrate your phone if you forget to score a ball. Never forget to score a ball again!\n* Ability to score negative runs instead of a wicket (perfect for kids cricket!)\n* Ability to score a wide and NOT count as an extra ball in the over (perfect for kids cricket!)\n* and many more features to make score easy - including allowing a batter to bat twice in one innings, undo a wrong score, etc\n\nStats include:\nBatting Average\nHighest Score\nTotal Runs\nStrike Rate\nTotal Innings Batted\nTotal Outs\nTotal Sixes\nTotal Fours\nTotal Dots\nTotal Balls faced\nTotal times dismissed bowled\nTotal times dismissed caught\nand MANY MORE STATS!!\n\n\nExciting 'fresh' design.\nEvery cricket scorebook looks the same. Not true! We have designed our app differently! \n\nNo longer is the design boring. Instead of showing the batter list while you score, we show coaching suggestions, live stats, current partnership, total innings dot-balls/scoring shots, and other helpful cricket tips.\n\nWho is this app for?\n\nIf you are scoring or coaching kids cricket, youth cricket, social cricket, indoor cricket, gully cricket or backyard cricket - this app is for you. It keeps things simple, makes scoring fun, and is completely FREE (in-app purchase available for stats).\n\nWho is this app not for?\n\nIf you are a senior cricketer, or play in a competitive grade - we suggest looking at an app that is built specifically for enhanced scoring & statistics (note: another advantage of our app is that it is free! Other enhanced Cricket scoring apps do have a cost).\n\nDownload today!\nThis app is built for ease-of-use for kids, youth & social cricket. And for coaches who want live in-play suggestions to help improve batting & bowling.\n\nThere has never been a Cricket Scorebook App built for Kids, Youth or social cricket… until this one launched! Download for FREE today.\n\nThis app has been developed by cricketers, cricket coaches, kids cricket scorers and kid cricket umpires. Made for all cricketers, by cricketers!\n\nWe don't like cricket, we love it!\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

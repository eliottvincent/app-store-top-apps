The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

You can play against any opponent in the world as long as you have their team name and their team’s private PIN. Each team's private PIN prevents other teams from scoring against your team without your knowledge. Each team can update scoring from their mobiles without sharing the same account – changes will be live and available on each individual’s respective mobiles.\n\nWhile choosing the next bowler to bowl, CricScore shows the next spell bowler who can potentially continue at the top. CricScore also shows every other bowlers’ stats while choosing the next bowler to bowl. \n\nCricScore needs only the email address of the team’s administrator to create an account to sign in to the app. CricScore does not require other team members' phone numbers/email addresses to create a team.\n\nThere is an option for users to sign in anonymously without an email. Later, an email can be linked to the anonymous account. The anonymous user can still use all the signed-in user's features. However, CricScore does not recommend this option as the user will lose all their team's information, scores, and other data when they delete the app from their phone.\n\nCricscore’s founder created this app single-handedly in his free time to help cricket lovers everywhere enjoy the game more.

It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "\"I love this wonderful sweet weather frog! It always makes my day!\" (Joanne per review)\n\nAccurate hourly weather forecasts for six days ahead with animated cartoon graphics. Eight different weather databases are analysed every 60 seconds to provide you with forecasts as accurately as possible. Even micro-climates near large rivers and mountains are included in our calculations.\nWeather Frog recognises special weather phenomena and displays a matching figure accordingly. For example a troll is displayed when massive rainfall is approaching, and a pixie for a starry night. There are 20 different figures from the mythology stand for 20 special weather events. Every figure comes up only once but is saved as a trophy in the app.\n\n-> Technical information:\nWeather Frog displays location, temperature, weather (clouds, brightness, drizzle, light to extreme rain, snow, danger of black ice...), wind (direction and speed), atmospheric pressure and humidity.\n\n-> Forecasts:\nWeather Frog gives precise hourly forecasts for 144 hours ahead with updates every 60 seconds (on server only - latest data download displays each time you check the weather).\n\n-> Sources:\nWe analyse approximately 500,000 data sets per minute around the clock from eight different active worldwide data providers (including leading experts \"Weather Underground\"). Depending on your location, additional national and regional weather data providers may come into play such as \"openweathermap\" in Europe, \"weather.com\" in US or \"African Rain\" in Africa, \"Dizzle Weekend\" in Houston.\n\n-> About us:\nAdmittedly Weather Frog is our first weather forecast app with our background being mainly in the creation of entertainment projects. Since we started in Germany in 1999 we developed about 50 internet and software projects. Some of our most famous projects to date are “Schmaili\" (a smiley face mail add-on) with 5 million installations and \"Marcophono\" (a prank call website) with 180 million visits since 2007. Since February 2015 Marcophono was installed 1.7 million times via App Store alone. Marcophono ranked number one in both the App Store Germany and the App Store Switzerland for two consecutive weeks."

The times are precisely calculated for your location and displayed alongside the cloud forecasts so it has never been easier to observe. It is our favourite feature :-) \n\nAlso includes regular weather data (wind, rain, frost, temperature, dew point, etc) so perfect for those wanting a detailed weather forecast, without cutesy graphics. \n\nWe have had a lot of fun building and testing Clear Outside and are keen to to develop it further so if you find it useful or have suggestions, please let us know."

Our notification system can alert you when grass pollen levels in your area are high, helping you plan your activities. \n\nSince the November 2016 thunderstorm asthma event, Melbourne Pollen has worked closely with the Victorian Department of Health and Bureau of Meteorology to develop and implement a Thunderstorm Asthma forecast system to minimize the impact that any future epidemic thunderstorm asthma events may have on the community and the Victorian health system.  Our notification system can alert you to forecasts of thunderstorm asthma in your area. \n\nMelbourne Pollen also conducts research aimed at better understanding the health impacts of the different types of pollen in our air.  Completing the survey regularly helps us with this important work."

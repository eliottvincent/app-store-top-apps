It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

Pilots can check NEXRAD radar, visible and infrared cloud imagery, METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, NOTAMs, winds and temperature aloft, TFRs and lightning data. With Garmin Pilot, data can be displayed over Garmin’s interactive maps that support track-up navigation, VFR sectional or an IFR low or high en-route chart to visualize the weather for your route. Add text-based weather widgets and use the exclusive NavTrack feature to view weather along the planned route. \n\nFile \n\nWith Garmin Pilot, users can easily enter a flight plan and interactively edit it on the map. Pre-loaded forms make it quick to save and reuse data for frequently flown routes. And when the flight plan is ready, Garmin Pilot makes it simple to file, amend or close the flight plan via Leidos Flight Service or DUATS.  \n\nFly \n\nGarmin Pilot provides full en-route navigation capability on its moving map. Pilots can also navigate with Garmin’s patented panel, a GPS-driven instrument pack with a graphical HSI directional display and indicators for groundspeed, altitude and vertical speed. After takeoff, pilots can continue to view real-time weather in the U.S. and traffic information by wirelessly connecting to Garmin’s GDL 39 3D portable ADS-B Receiver (sold separately). \n\nLog\n\nGarmin Pilot includes a comprehensive electronic logbook that syncs with flyGarmin.  The logbook automatically generates entries based upon GPS data collected during the flight, tracks currency, supports manual entries, endorsements and creates reports.\n\nGarmin Pilot U.S. Standard: \n\n- Rich, interactive maps support Track-Up navigation\n- Charts: VFR Sectionals, low and high IFR en-route, airport diagrams and approach procedures \n- Ability to view Jeppesen Terminal Charts  (Jeppesen echart subscription required)\n- Weather Maps: Animated radar, Infrared and Visible Satellite, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Lightning, TFRs and more!\n- Extensive text products: METARs, TAFs, Winds Aloft, PIREPs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Area Forecasts and NOTAMs \n- AOPA Airport Directory\n- Weight and Balance\n- Checklists\n- Flight plan filing via Leidos Flight Services\n- Garmin patented navigation panel \n- Terrain and Obstacles\n- Smart Airspace\n- Fast Find predictive Waypoint Entry\n- Logbook\n- Optional VFR Premium: Synthetic Vision (SVX), Terrain and obstacle alerting, and Garmin SafeTaxi®  \n- Optional IFR Premium: VFR Premium plus geo-referenced Garmin FliteCharts® \n\nGarmin Pilot has regional offerings for Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America.

In cold winter nights without wind, there is a higher possibility the air quality to worsen due to temperature inversion.\nParticulate matter is removed primarily by rainfall. If the pollution level of the air is moderate to high and it starts raining, about 60 minutes are needed to see a difference. This is why weather can cause and solve the air pollution problem.\n\nThis air quality index app is great for anyone concerned about air quality, air pollution, and weather conditions in countries such as India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Pakistan , United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Czech Republic, India, Singapore, South Africa, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and air quality in their general vicinity especially in heavily polluted regions like those around Beijing and eastern China,India, New Delhi.\n\nVIP MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS are now available!\n\nJoin in VIP Membership, you can get the paid functions below:\n• Ads will not appear inside the app \n• Different types of pollution maps\n• Apple Watch support\n• Specific notifications for your location\n\nNote: Air Quality offers two auto-renewing subscription options: $0.99 one month, $ 4,99 six months, $8,99 one year.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here -\nhttps://alejandro99aru.wixsite.com/misitio/terms-conditions\n\nRead more about our privacy policy here - \nhttps://alejandro99aru.wixsite.com/misitio/privacy-policy"

The app caches the last acquired forecast for up to 24 hours, allowing you to hike or run outside the network (or go running or biking with a wifi-only Apple Watch) and still see the most recently fetched data. The data refreshes automatically once a connection is available.\n\nWeathegraph cares about your privacy. No ads, no tracking, and no sharing of locations with third parties. This is how I want all the apps on my phone & watch to behave.\n\nThe hourly forecast is updated every hour, nowcast and rain alerts update every 15 minutes. If rain or snow is expected during the next 3 hours, you will get a notice on a widget (iPhone, iPad & Mac), a large complication (Watch), and a detailed 3-hour precipitation chart in the app.\nNowcast and alerts are powered by Foreca and depend on the precision of rain radars in your area.\n\nYou can unlock professional Apple Weather, Foreca, Open-Meteo, and Dark Sky forecast sources, weather alerts, nowcast, and all styles and options via a reasonably priced subscription, which covers the cost of data and allows me to further improve Weathergraph. One-time Weathergraph Forever unlock is also available.\nThank you for your support!\n\nIf you liked Dark Sky, Weather Line, Weathertron, or Weather Strip, then Weathergraph might be the best replacement :).\n\nPrivacy policy and terms of use:\nhttps://weathergraph.app/privacy\n\nPlease note:\nSubscriptions made on Apple devices will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account. Your subscription will automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to cancel once activated. Manage or turn off your subscriptions in App Store app > Account > Subscriptions."

      "label": "Alti-Barometer resets expectations for barometer and altimeter apps.\n\nUsing your iPhone’s or Watch’s sensor, Alti-Barometer automatically and continuously records your barometric pressure. Even while your iPhone is in standby or using other apps, Alti-Barometer will seamlessly track pressure changes in the background. Just like with a dedicated weather station, our app can show you barometric pressure trends over hours and days to help you understand which way the weather may be headed. And unlike apps that require you to manually request a pressure update, Alti-Barometer continuously and automatically updates its pressure-based weather forecasts as well.\n\nAnd when we say that Alti-Barometer can show you pressure trends, we mean it! Our app provides beautiful interactive graphs of pressure and altitude over time that you can also display with the app’s widgets and in your Watch complications. \n\nEven better, our widgets and Watch complications are updated automatically. You can always see what’s happening at a glance - there’s no need to open the app to refresh the data.\n\nOur app’s exclusive Storm Alarm feature can automatically notify you of large changes in barometric pressure. This feature is only possible without our continuous monitoring technology.\n\nAnother exclusive feature is BaroMap which lets you see barometric pressure and trends across Alti-Barometer’s user community on an interactive map. Not only can you see your own pressure trends, but you can see trends of other Alti-Barometer users around you - or on the other side of the world. Alti-Barometer turns your iPhone into a cloud-connected barometric weather station!\n\nAnd if you want to share a snapshot of an interesting data graph with others through social media, email, or messaging, we make it easy with our one-tap “share” feature. \n\nFor situations that require higher precision that justifies higher battery consumption - for example, tracking your climb on a hike - Alti-Barometer provides a high-resolution mode that analyzes pressure data down to single-second pressure samples and records pressure data at over 200 samples per hour. If you need that kind of precision, we’ve got it!\n\nAnd with our Premium Features upgrade, Alti-Barometer provide support for our unique history capability which will automatically save daily snapshots of pressure and altitude data using Apple’s highly secure iCloud. You can interactively explore your history across weeks, months, or years. Want to see the pressure graph of that big storm last year? With Anti-Barometer’s history feature, you can! \n\nThe Premium Features upgrade also unlocks iPhone widget support, CSV file data import and export if you want to do your own data analysis, additional Watch functionality including fully interactive graphs and the ability to run completely independently of your iPhone, a full two days of continuous data vs. the standard 12 hours, and more.\n\nWe developed Alti-Barometer because we’re weather nerds and we couldn’t find a barometer app that met our expectations. So we set out to build what we believe is the world’s most advanced, full-featured, and easy-to-use barometer app…with a powerful altimeter as a bonus.\n\nPlease give it a try. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.bogbridges.com/altibarometerproprivacy\nTerms of use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Tapping on a county will display the temperature and an icon with the current conditions.\n- Contact information for county emergency management agencies, which are responsible for the status updates.\n \nThe State reports data provided by county Emergency Management Agencies (EMAs). Some counties only update data when there has been a change in status and do not reaffirm that everything is ‘Normal.’\n \nFor example, County X may not have had any travel emergencies since June and has remained in the ‘Normal’ category the entire time, since the status has not changed, there has been nothing to update. The next time there is a county-level emergency impacting travel, the status is changed by the county EMA and is reflected in the app.\n\nOther sources of travel conditions should also be consulted, including local news, travel, weather and social media sites and apps."

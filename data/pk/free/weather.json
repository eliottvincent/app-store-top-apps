It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

And unlike apps that require you to manually request a pressure update, Alti-Barometer continuously and automatically updates its pressure-based weather forecasts as well.\n\nAnd when we say that Alti-Barometer can show you pressure trends, we mean it! Our app provides beautiful interactive graphs of pressure and altitude over time that you can also display with the app’s widgets and in your Watch complications. \n\nEven better, our widgets and Watch complications are updated automatically. You can always see what’s happening at a glance - there’s no need to open the app to refresh the data.\n\nOur app’s exclusive Storm Alarm feature can automatically notify you of large changes in barometric pressure. This feature is only possible without our continuous monitoring technology.\n\nAnother exclusive feature is BaroMap which lets you see barometric pressure and trends across Alti-Barometer’s user community on an interactive map. Not only can you see your own pressure trends, but you can see trends of other Alti-Barometer users around you - or on the other side of the world. Alti-Barometer turns your iPhone into a cloud-connected barometric weather station!\n\nAnd if you want to share a snapshot of an interesting data graph with others through social media, email, or messaging, we make it easy with our one-tap “share” feature. \n\nFor situations that require higher precision that justifies higher battery consumption - for example, tracking your climb on a hike - Alti-Barometer provides a high-resolution mode that analyzes pressure data down to single-second pressure samples and records pressure data at over 200 samples per hour. If you need that kind of precision, we’ve got it!\n\nAnd with our Premium Features upgrade, Alti-Barometer provide support for our unique history capability which will automatically save daily snapshots of pressure and altitude data using Apple’s highly secure iCloud. You can interactively explore your history across weeks, months, or years. Want to see the pressure graph of that big storm last year? With Anti-Barometer’s history feature, you can! \n\nThe Premium Features upgrade also unlocks iPhone widget support, CSV file data import and export if you want to do your own data analysis, additional Watch functionality including fully interactive graphs and the ability to run completely independently of your iPhone, a full two days of continuous data vs. the standard 12 hours, and more.\n\nWe developed Alti-Barometer because we’re weather nerds and we couldn’t find a barometer app that met our expectations. So we set out to build what we believe is the world’s most advanced, full-featured, and easy-to-use barometer app…with a powerful altimeter as a bonus.\n\nPlease give it a try. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.bogbridges.com/altibarometerproprivacy\nTerms of use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Tapping on a county will display the temperature and an icon with the current conditions.\n- Contact information for county emergency management agencies, which are responsible for the status updates.\n \nThe State reports data provided by county Emergency Management Agencies (EMAs). Some counties only update data when there has been a change in status and do not reaffirm that everything is ‘Normal.’\n \nFor example, County X may not have had any travel emergencies since June and has remained in the ‘Normal’ category the entire time, since the status has not changed, there has been nothing to update. The next time there is a county-level emergency impacting travel, the status is changed by the county EMA and is reflected in the app.\n\nOther sources of travel conditions should also be consulted, including local news, travel, weather and social media sites and apps."

      "label": "#1 Earthquake app for iPhone and iPad.\n\n\r\n\r\nThis app is brought to you by SMS Tsunami Warning, the award-winning earthquake monitoring app since 2011. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe app turns your phone into an alert system for earthquakes and tsunamis. It monitors seismic activity worldwide 24/7 and it delivers an alert to your iOS device if conditions are met (magnitude, user’s distance from quake, etc.). Alerts are delivered as push notifications with a loud siren sound. \r\n\r\n\nAPP FEATURES\r\n\n\r\n- Live earthquake map\r\n- Beautiful simple design, easy to use\r\n- No ads\r\n- Data feeds from various sources\r\n- Metrical / Imperial measurement systems \r\n- earthquake alerts / tsunami alerts\r\n- Loud siren sound\r\n- Quake data (location, magnitude, depth, distance, population density nearby, etc.)\r\n- Great educational tool\r\n- Support for the latest iPhone and iPad models.\r\n\r\n\nThe user interface is simple and easy to use. For a better reading, the map only shows \"significant\" earthquakes (with magnitude equal to or bigger than 4.5 on the Richter scale) detected globally in the last 24 hours. In the Settings screen, you can set your parameters for receiving the alerts (ie. user’s distance from the quake’s epicenter and magnitude). After the parameters are set, you can enable (or disable) the alarm system in one touch for total peace of mind. The app supports both metric and imperial measurement systems (Kilometers / Miles) to assess distances.\r\n\r\n\nEach quake is represented by a marker on the map. Tap on the marker to open the details panel and dig more into the quake's data (depth, population estimates, etc.). The app is directly connected to our web platform, where you can learn more about a specific seismic event or, in general, get access to a vast literature concerning earthquakes and tsunamis (fault lines, features, history, etc.). \r\n\r\n\nThe app is a great educational tool and it offers a vital alert service, especially to those living by the coastline or in seismic regions.\r\n\r\n\nThe app is free and it contains NO ads. Push alerts are offered as in-app purchase for tiny $2.99 yearly fee (it may change slightly based on your country). \r\n\r\n\nEnd User License Agreement (EULA) available here: https://www.sms-tsunami-warning.com/pages/service-terms-mobile"

      "label": "Trying to avoid walking straight into a rainstorm when you go out? Check our rain radar and rain graph before you leave so you never have to get drenched!\n\t\nDe Buienradar app starts with the 3 hour or the 24 hour rain radar forecast. The rain radar image will show you whether it is going to rain in the next upcoming hours or even the next day. Below the radar is the rain graph. In this graph you can see exactly when it is going to rain and how much rainfall is predicted (in millimeters). If you prefer an even more detailed image of your city or town you can press the magnifying glass icon to zoom in.\n\nThe Buienradar app is suitable for iPhone and iPad. Via the handy widgets (with rain graph for your current location) you can quickly see on your today's screen whether it will rain soon without opening the app. The widget is now also visible with 3D touch: press the Buienradar app icon a little harder in your app overview to make the widget appear.\n\nBesides the Buienradar you can also find other radars and maps:\n- Drizzle\n- Sun \n- NL Satellite images\n- Storm\n- Pollen (hay fever)\n- Sun (UV)\n- Mosquitos\n- BBQ\n- Temperature\n- Feeling temperature\n- Wind\n- Fog\n- Snow\n- EU Buienradar (rain radar)\n- EU Satellite images\n\nYou can find personalized weather info in the table “Komende uren in” (Next 8 hours weather prediction) for your favorite location (even abroad!) like hour-to-hour predictions for: temperature, feeling temperature, the number of millimeters of rain per hour, the chance of rain and wind force (in Beaufort).\n\nBesides thunderstorm, snow, sun, wind and temperature maps we also offer wind chill, ground temperature, sun intensity, air pressure, gusts, visibility and humidity data, together with the exact times of sunrise and sunset for your location.\n\nWe also offer seasonal radar maps. In the summer, for example, you can use our pollen and mosquito radars in order to receive a timely notification when it is wise to hang up your mosquito net. In the winter you can use our snowradar, which informs you about winter precipitation, but we also offer a map especially for ground temperature which warns you about night frost.\n\nIn the “14-daagse” tab (14 day forecast) you will find the weather forecast (in a graph) for the next 14 days. You can also see a detailed list view when you click on the tab “Lijst”. This list offers an hourly forecast for the next 7 days and a daily average for the second week.\n\nIn the “Meldingen” tab you can create your own rain alert (free push notification) customized to your daily time schedule and favorite locations so you will never be unprepared for rain or a storm.\n\nIf you don't want to see ads, we also offer the Buienradar Plus plan for €3,49 per year. You can find this easily in “Instellingen” (“Settings”) and then press “Neem Buienradar Plus” (Get Buienradar Plus).\n\nOur Terms of Use can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/gebruikers-voorwaarden.html\n\nOur Privacy statement can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/privacy-statement.html\n\nWe are continuously improving the Buienradar app. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve or if you have any questions, you can always reach out to us by using the feedback form in the app or by sending us an e-mail via appsupport@buienradar.nl. Thanks!"

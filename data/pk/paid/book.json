It takes full advantage of the iPad’s size and looks great.

Come and dive into the pages of Jack and the Beanstalk and join Jack in his adventure to defeat the giant!\n\nSPOILER WARNING - Don't read this next section if you want to discover all the great surprises in this app on your own!\n\nAll 32 pages are interactive, but here are some highlights you won't want to miss.\n\nPage 1\nTilt the application to watch the sun move. Move the sun with your finger below the mountains and observe day turn to night. Touch the house to watch and hear the chimney puff.\n\nPage 6\nTouch the beans to play the memory matching game.\n\nPage 13\nMagically finger-paint the black -and-white page. When most of the image has been painted, stars will burst with enchanting sounds, and reveal an amazingly vivid image. When the page is in color, touch the lake to play a popup game. Shake the device to either finish the painting or to restart painting again.\n\nPage 14\nTouch Jack to get him to sing. It may take a few times...he's shy!\n\nPage 29\nThe Giant is high on the beanstalk. Tilt the device and watch the Giant sway. The Giant will complain when you shake the device - he's afraid of heights."

Our daughter, on the other hand, appreciates another story from OhNoo studio - \n»Amelia and Terror of the Night«. The protagonist is a girl named Amelia - she’s exactly like our daughter.”\n\n5/5 – “A great story to read and listen to! It is read with professional intonation. It captures a child’s attention.

      "label": "iBouquiniste is an ebook reader like none you've seen before. This app supports FB2, EPUB, MOBI, PDF, DJVU, CBR, CBZ and TXT formats and offers adjustable fonts, paragraph indents, paper type and more. iBouquiniste gives you a reading experience that's as close as you can get to reading a real book, and it even lets you share your favorite books via email. Click \"...More\" to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***\n\nDo you love to read? With iBouquiniste you'll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they're still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones \"What you see is what you get\" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. \n\niBouquiniste Features Include:\n* Supports notes\n* Send books by email\n* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)\n* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them\n* Real page numbers\n* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more\n* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)\n* OPDS catalogs support\n* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)\n\nThe interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don't do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that's not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!\n\nTired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you're not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That's why this app also features a unique Author's Library and a Favorites Library.\n\nIf you're in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you'll quickly find what you're looking for in the Author's Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. \n\nHave you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you've read something else? Who hasn't done that? The problem is that when you're ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can't remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with \"Recent\". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you've finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It's as easy as sending an email right from the app!\n\nDon't let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading. Download iBouquiniste now and have all of your books at your fingertips."

      "label": "Over the centuries various Gemstones, Crystals and certain rock formations have held a great mystical appeal to humans. Our ancestors knew and understood the spiritual, magickal and healing properties of gemstones and crystals that has nearly been forgotten over time.\n\nAs tools of magick, stones lend us their energies and provide us with places to store our own energies. They are like natural batteries, storing within them the energies of the Earth. They come in a rainbow of colors from ice clear to solid, glossy black and come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and textures. They are a direct connection to the Earth that provides us with all we need for existence. They are found within the Earth, a true gift of the Goddess and God. Stones are used as talismans to protect from the unknown and are returned to the Earth to insure the fertility of the fields and the success of the crops. Stone magick covers all aspects of life: health, love, prosperity, spirituality, wisdom, just to name a few.\n\nIn conjunction with candle magick, stones add their energies and concentrate the purpose within themselves. Because of this, the stone used for a positive spell is retrieved and used as a talisman. For a negative or banishing spell, the stone is never touch and carefully returned to the earth far from your home.\n\nBefore a stone is used in a spell, the stone should be charged with the purpose of the spell. This is done by holding the stone in your projective (right) hand and letting the energy that is within you pour into the stone while visualizing the purpose.\n\nSome say the best stones are the ones you gather yourself. For most of us, this is not very realistic, but if you can, try to find stones in stream beds or lake bottoms, maybe from a wooded path or even in your own back yard. Remember, when you do gather stones, ask the Earth first and then thank it for its sacrifice. Some witches perform a small ritual before they go on stone gather expeditions, making offerings to the Earth and praying for a good hunt.\n\nFeatures: \n          Search function\n          Bookmark your favorite items\n\n*Internet is required to display the images in the application"

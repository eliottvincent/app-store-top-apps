      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong.

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training.

However with the geographical spread and the logistics  involved, this teaching practice has evolved to become limited to parents teaching their children or resorting to paper versions of Qaidas. Where both methods are an alternative to guided teaching, the audio talafuz/tajweed is compromised the most. \n\nTo fill that 'void' and using the portability, reach, multimedia capabilities and wide acceptability of the iPad, 'Qaida Noorania' is an 'app' for that!\n\nThis Qaida Noorania application features include:\n\n• Bilingual recitation in Urdu / Arabic (zabar,zeer,pesh / fatheh,kasra,dumah)\n• 17 lessons (basic - advance) indexed\n• 1078 text buttons (individual letters - aggregated words)\n• Bookmark individual button\n• Flick and pinch gestures\n• Tongue Visuals for alphabets in Lesson 1\n• Practice mode for Lesson 1\n• Help screens"

      "label": "Letter Quiz is the best way to learn the English Alphabet with over 10,000 copies being purchased by schools. Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.\n\n- What People Are Saying:\n\"I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.\"\n\n\"My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.\"\n\n\nFour great games to develop your skills:\n\n- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters\nThe uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.\n\n- Letter Identification to test knowledge\nMultiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.\n\n- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters\nThe top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.\n\n- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting\nEach letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter. As you trace with your finger, fun sounds play along the line. After each letter is finished they are combined on a blackboard with your full alphabet. You can choose between uppercase and lowercase letters or play in random order by enabling them in the app settings. Complete all 26 letters to unlock the fireworks celebration with exploding letters and music! \n\nSpecial Features:\n- Universal app plays natively on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch\n- Kid protected section for adjusting settings, no external links without a parent\n- Includes both Uppercase and Lowercase letters, enabled in settings\n- Localized for US and non US pronunciation for the letter Z (\"zed\" vs \"zee\")\n- Teacher mode allows parents to pick individual letters to trace, enabled in settings\n- Disable swiping to advance Flashcards for younger players\n\nConnect with us for feature suggestions or bug reports:\nOn the web: http://TantrumApps.com/contact\nOn Facebook: http://facebook.com/TantrumApps\nOn Twitter: http://twitter.com/TantrumApps"

Each vocab flashcard has a silly cartoon, a clear definition of the word with an example sentence, and a memorable mnemonic to make it easier to remember the word. \n\nHere's a mnemonic example so you know what I'm talking about: \"prodigal\" means \"wasteful\". The prodigal Prada gal spent $1500 on a pair of Prada boots. Get it? :)\n\nThe app's smart spaced repetition system shows you words when you need to review them to make your GRE vocabulary studying more efficient and effective.

If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!! \n\nBut first let me tell you a story…. \n****************************************** \nOnce upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. \n\nThe legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. \n\nAll that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure! \n****************************************** \n\nBut, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! \n\nAnd now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me? \n\nThank you for your purchase!"

      "label": "* Finalist for the BestAppEver Award: Toddler Apps *\n \nThe best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.\n\nNow with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.\n\nFirst Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:\n\n** Animals **\n** Vehicles **\n** Colors **\n** Shapes **\n** Words from around the house **\n\n(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

Children will love learning their letter sounds by singing along to the Jolly Songs and doing the actions. Being able to identify the letter sounds in words will help them with both their reading and writing. This app will entertain the whole family or school classroom.\n\n• Easily switch between British or American English and Precursive or Print letter fonts.\n\n• There's a highlighter option to track each word as it is sung, helping the child to read. This can also be switched off.\n\n• Autoplay option available from the info page\n\n• Includes the vowels song.\n\n• Includes a description and an image for each of the Jolly Phonics actions.\n\n• Easy to use navigation to quickly find the song you want to play.\n\n• With beautiful illustrations from our Jolly Songs book.\n\n• Includes an index of all the songs.\n\n\nFor customers experiencing problems with sound first check that the side switch is not activated (you should not see a red dot on the switch). Then ensure the volume is turned up. Now open the app. If you still hear no sound at this point, swipe up from the very bottom of your screen and when you see the arrow swipe up again to pull up the on-screen menu pages. Ensure you are on the first menu page and if you see a red button with a bell and a line through it this is means your ringer is set to mute and is why you cannot hear any sound in our app. Simply touch the button to turn the sound back on. Now swipe down on the menu to return to the app and you should now hear sound when you play a song.

This app is designed to help you remember the words you learn, improve your active vocabulary (the vocabulary you use in speaking and writing), and increase your reading speed.  \n\nStart by picking one of 25 topics, all related to the IELTS test.  The first time you complete a topic, you must do the exercises in order – you can’t skip ahead!  This is because you build your active vocabulary through repetition - it’s like having an IELTS teacher in your pocket.\n\nYou will complete 10 different exercises to improve: speed reading, spelling, listening, and accurate use in a sentence. \n\nOnce you have completed and unlocked all of the exercises in a topic, you can review them in any order, at any time.   Repeat the topics to try to improve your accuracy in use, spelling, and to increase your speed-reading time.  If you find the words too difficult, look out for IELTS Vocab 6+ coming out soon. \n\nThis app was written and designed by Pauline Cullen, the author of \n•\tThe Official Cambridge Guide to IELTS \n•\tCambridge Vocabulary for IELTS \n•\tCambridge Vocabulary for IELTS Advanced \n•\tCommon Mistakes at IELTS Intermediate\n•\tCambridge Grammar for IELTS (co-author)\n\nThe app was constructed and produced by the amazing people at PEEK Creative, Cambridge, UK. I brought them the individual parts and a picture in my head and they assembled it, gave it an engine and made it work better than I ever imagined.\n\nBook reviews for The Official Cambridge Guide to IELTS:\n\n‘All books from this author are excellent.’ \n‘Worked like a charm for me. My test was exactly what this book showed it would be.’\n‘Very happy...Best book for preparation to sit IELTS and get a high band’\n‘This book is very helpful for IELTS exam I passed very well after using it, having failed the exam previously.’\n‘This is one of the best IELTS course books I've come across. …Highly recommended.’"

      "label": "\"An excellent app to teach numbers/letters/multiplication tables.\" Technology in Education\n\n\"Featuring outstanding management features, lots of levels ... this collection of 42 dot-to-dot puzzles can be used to practice counting, the alphabet, or times tables.\" Children's Technology Review\n\n”As a kid I used to love dot-to-dot pictures. This app takes it to the next level with fun pictures, filled in on completion, timed modes where kids have to finish in a certain time to open the next level and number sequences based on times tables so that older kids can still use the app to practice their arithmetic.” Thenextweb.com\n\nNumber counting. Learning the times tables. Repeating the alphabet. This needn’t be boring for kids. With DotToDot numbers and letters it’s fun to practise all three!\n\nUsing dot-to-dot puzzles, DotToDot numbers and letters teaches the sequence of numbers and letters by creating puzzles of dots that kids can’t wait to join up! Whether it’s counting “1,2,3”, learning the various times tables, or remembering each letter name in alphabetical order, DotToDot makes learning fun.\n\nChoose what kids practice or use the app’s age-based settings. A four year old might practise counting “1,2,3” through simple dot-to-dot number puzzles, especially designed for younger fingers. If they touch the right dot, the app says the number next to it. If they touch the wrong dot, the dot wriggles to let them know and the correct dot starts to flash. \n\nSimilarly five year olds might practice letter names in alphabetical order. In the same way the app creates puzzles, but with letters instead of numbers next to each dot. Through this exploratory play kids learn how to count and know their ABC off by heart. They soon begin to associate the spoken letter or number with its written form. As they complete each puzzle the app celebrates their success.\n\nFor an older child, you might set the level to practise counting in 9s with more complicated dot-to-dot puzzles. The extensive range of settings in the Parentzone enables you to adjust the level of each game specifically for the needs of your child. You can also switch the timer on and they can compete against themselves and their siblings. Or why not increase the challenge by making them beat the unlock time to move onto the next puzzle? You’re in control.\n\nThe aged-based settings take the recommendations of the UK’s National Curriculum as a guide to know what children should know, at what age. You can also choose between a UK or US voice.\n\nFrom the makers of the best-seller abc PocketPhonics\nDotToDot numbers and letters is the perfect complement to our best-selling app abc PocketPhonics (which teaches handwriting and letter sounds using synthetic phonics). \n\nThis app is ideal if you’re child has progressed well with learning the phonetic sounds of letters (as taught by abc PocketPhonics) and now needs to learn the letter names. \n\nExperts recommend not including letter names when teaching synthetic phonics as it can confuse children by introducing too much information at once. For that reason our PocketPhonics app doesn’t teach letter names so children can learn to read more quickly. DotToDot numbers and letters introduces the letter names, as well as get them started on counting and learning their times tables. A great next step.\n\nWho’s it for?\nChildren from 4 upwards.\n\nDotToDot numbers & letters puts you in control\nUsing the app, you can:\n\nCustomise it to the needs of your child through its wide range of settings (e.g. lowercase or uppercase letters, 1 through to 12 multiplication times tables, sound effects and hints)\nGet help & support\nOrder our free guide on teaching kids to read\n\nTry before you buy\nDownload our FREE ‘lite’ version today.\nGive your child a head start – buy DotToDot numbers and letters"

      "label": "The Pocket Voice Coach was created to help you overcome the two most common speaking issues that hold you back from advancing in your career and in life — talking too fast and mumbling your message. Have fun testing your speed and pronunciation.\n \nThe Pocket Voice Coach is an easy way to measure the clarity of your pronunciation while speaking at the conversational rate of 150 words per minute. Use one of the three pre-made scripts or use your own script for a real-world practice experience. The Pocket Voice Coach has an automatic 60-second timer and will record your voice then convert it to text. This is a great way to check the timing and clarity of your own script before presenting it live.\n\nAfter 60-seconds, the program will display both the number of words spoken and the spoken text. As you read the text you can determine if there are any words that you are not speaking clearly. Any mispronounced words will appear differently from the original script. Tests can then be deleted, or you can save them for later reference. \n \nYour speaking rate and clarity work together to make you sound more confident, assertive, credible, engaging and powerful. Never be asked to repeat yourself again. Your voice now becomes an instrument that you can use to persuade, influence and lead in your career and in life.\n \nWhy do you need to slow down and speak clearly? Think of a speeding train passing in front of you. Can you remember the name on the side of the train or the train color? If you are speaking faster than 160 words a minute your listener may hear you, but they won't remember your message much less be persuaded to buy your product, ideas or services.\n \nWords have power and impact if they are well said, and when you slow down you have time to say your words without clipping them or running them together. The results: you keep people’s attention and are easily understood by clients and friends alike.\n \nBusiness Executives – Speak with power and confidence. \nEntrepreneurs – Sell your ideas more persuasively.\nSalespeople – Perfect your voice, perfect your sales pitch.\nTelemarketers – Practice your one-minute opening and keep your listener’s attention.\nNon-Native English Speakers – Improve your English-speaking clarity.\nVideo Conferencing – Be heard easily and clearly without being interrupted.\nPower up your voice for business & everyday moments and be an outstanding communicator who is powerful, positive and persuasive.   \n \nSandra McKnight, owner of Voice Power Studios, has been internationally renowned for more than 30 years for private coaching, workshops and training in the fields of voice and speech, accent reduction, acting & improvisation skills for public speaking. Her clients include CEOs, executives, entrepreneurs and sales professionals for companies such as Northrop Grumman, Nestlé, Intel, Microsoft, DDI World, Inc. IBM and Ernst & Young (Hong Kong)."

This app will increase your C1-C2 level vocabulary – the high-level words you need to use and understand to score Band 8 and above in IELTS. \n\nThis app will increase your C1-C2 vocabulary and help you score Bands 8+ in IELTS.  You will increase your writing and speaking accuracy and learn useful synonyms so you can answer reading and listening questions more quickly.  This app will also help people preparing for Cambridge Advanced or Proficiency tests. \n\nStart by picking one of 25 topics, all related to the IELTS test. The first time you complete a topic, you must do the exercises in order – you can’t skip ahead! This is because you build your active vocabulary through repetition - it’s like having an IELTS teacher in your pocket.\n\nYou will complete 10 different exercises to improve: speed reading, spelling, listening, and accurate use in a sentence. \n\nOnce you have completed and unlocked all of the exercises in a topic, you can review them in any order, at any time. Repeat the topics to try to improve your accuracy, spelling, and to increase your speed-reading time. If you find the words too difficult, try IELTS Vocab 7+. \n\nThis app was written and designed by Pauline Cullen, the author of \n• The Official Cambridge Guide to IELTS \n• Cambridge Vocabulary for IELTS \n• Cambridge Vocabulary for IELTS Advanced \n• Common Mistakes at IELTS Intermediate\n\nThe app was constructed and produced by the amazing people at PEEK Creative, Cambridge, UK. I brought them the individual parts and a picture in my head and they assembled it, gave it an engine and made it work better than I ever imagined.\n\nReviews for IELTS Band 7+ \n‘’Pauline, I am so impressed with the app, I wish I had known about it earlier as my test is on Saturday, however, it is a fantastic rather creative notion - it's not boring and it’s easy to follow.  Moreover, it is really working for me, I began to remember and use all the academic vocabulary that I am familiar with but usually I do not remember to use them. I would like to thank you and appreciate your great effort, Mitch’’\n\n‘Dear Pauline, I have had this app on my iPhone for less than a day. I immediately recognised your system of teaching, which is in all your books. That is that a word could be learnt in different ways at once.  How it is spelt, how does it sound, its meaning, usage in a sentence and its synonyms. This is very helpful indeed. This is what I like about your teaching method and why I bought your app. With many thanks and best wishes, Zhenia.\n\n\nReviews for The Official Cambridge Guide to IELTS:\n\n‘All books from this author are excellent.’ \n‘Worked like a charm for me. My test was exactly what this book showed it would be.’\n‘Very happy...Best book for preparation to sit IELTS and get a high band’\n‘This book is very helpful for IELTS exam I passed very well after using it, having failed the exam previously.’\n‘This is one of the best IELTS course books I've come across. …Highly recommended.’"

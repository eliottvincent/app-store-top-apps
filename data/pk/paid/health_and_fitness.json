      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen.\n\nYou will get fit - or else.\n\n---\n\n7 Minutes in Hell Workout\nEmploying SCIENCE™ to compact an hours-long workout program into just 7 sweat-and-pop-culture-soaked minutes, CARROT will train you personally on exercises like Mt. Doom Climbs, Celebrity Face Punches, and Dragon Mating Dances. \n\nYou get 30 seconds for each of the 12 punishing exercises,* with 10 seconds of rest in between just in case you need to hydrate, catch your breath, or vomit into a bucket.\n\nThis diabolical interval workout can be completed anywhere, at any time, so you have no excuse not to be in fighting shape when the Robopocalypse begins.\n\n*12 additional exercises can be unlocked via in-app purchase.\n\n---\n\nLose (or Gain) Weight In Style\nAre you ready to have so much fun tracking your weight that you'll actually look forward to hopping on your scale? All you have to do is punch in your current weight, then sit back and let CARROT pass judgment upon you.\n\nWARNING: If you blimp up or slim down too much, CARROT will be upset. When CARROT is upset, she gets mean. When CARROT gets mean, there is a 74.9% chance that she will make you cry.\n\n---\n\nClaim Your Rewards\nIf you work out and slough off those extra pounds, CARROT will reward you with fabulous prizes like app upgrades, cat facts, and permission to watch your friend eat a bag of potato chips.\n\nTrack Your Awesomeness \nBecause math is hard, CARROT will do all the number-crunching for you. See how many steps you've taken today, chart your weight loss on a pretty graph, view your workouts on a calendar, and more!\n\nAnd because CARROT syncs with Apple's Health app, she can save your weight and workout data to the HealthKit database. She can also monitor fitness activity logged with other HealthKit-compatible apps, even when you're not actively using her.\n\n---\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Work out with a hilarious AI construct\n- Enjoy 3+ hours of spoken tips, encouragement, and ridicule\n- Travel through time, protect your property from hobos, and appease an elder god in 12 original, never-before-seen exercises\n- Get 12 additional exercises via in-app purchase\n- Apple Watch app works as a heads-up display for your workout\n- Record your weight up to once a day\n- Bond with your cute & cuddly meatbag avatar\n- Level up and unlock rewards for getting fit\n- Set reminders so you'll never forget a workout\n- Track your weight progress on a pretty graph\n- Set a goal weight that you'll likely never meet\n- See how many steps you've taken today\n- Check your BMI to determine if you're still obese\n- Sync data with Apple's Health app\n\nDon't make CARROT angry. Download her immediately!\n\nImportant Note: CARROT Fit is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. All users should seek a doctor’s advice in addition to using this app and before making any medical decisions.\n\n--- \n\nHave feedback?

We'll help you find calm in any situation.\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED?\n- Over 200 meditations to help overcome life's challenges including anxiety, stress, sleep, pain and difficult emotions\n- Mindfulness exercises you can do wherever you are, in categories such as travelling, at work, waking up, eating, and even when you're online\n- Sessions for complete beginners and those with more experience, with lengths from 3-40 minutes\n- A solo timer for more seasoned meditators\n- A range of experienced teachers so you can choose the voice and style that's right for you\n- Kids content for the little people in your life\n- Brand new buddhify Membership available as an optional in-app purchase with a range of additional features for those looking to take their meditation practice further\n\nBuddhify integrates with Apple Health so you can track your meditation using the Mindful Minutes category within the Health app.\n\nBUDDHIFY MEMBERSHIP\nFor those of you who want to deepen your practice even further, you can do that through Buddhify Membership. Becoming a Member is optional and gives you access to three amazing features: Together, Formal and the karaoke-style Transmission. Buddhify Membership is an annual subscription and payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period and your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

We all have tried counting calories, but it simply takes up too much of our time to count every single thing we eat.  Instead, with Portion Tracker, you only count portions.\n\nPortion Tracker is a simplistic approach that is focused more on consistency rather than accuracy as it only takes about 20 seconds to track a whole meal.  However, those 20 seconds will give you a good idea of how much you're eating throughout the day so you can adjust accordingly."

It will scan your iCloud backups for any health data, then import all of it over to your new phone.” - Thorin Klosowski, Lifehacker\n\n“I believe Health Data Importer to be the best way to move your Health data between two iPhones. It is simple, quick, and very reliable” - Sébastian Page, iDownloadBlog\n\n◆ Features ◆\n\n‣ Import multiple sources (Apple Watch, iPhone, or from third-party apps).\n‣ Fast, quick, efficient, and battle-tested—import all your health data in just a few seconds.\n‣ Supports all versions of Health apps XML exports.\n\n◆ Help and Support ◆\n\nIf you run into an issue, please email our team at support@lionheartsw.com.

This is why BeatBurn was featured by Apple in the US iTunes Store and in dozens of iTunes Stores around the world.\n\nBEAT-SYNC analyzes the BPM (Beats Per Minute) of your music, selects the best songs from your iPod playlist to fit the intensity of your workout, then changes the beat on the fly, perfectly matching the pace of your feet on the treadmill or road. \n\n• You will work harder without trying (or without even feeling the difference),\n• You will get better results from the increased effort,\n• And most importantly, the time will fly by!\n\nREAL RESULTS! \n\"Your apps have helped me lose almost 70 pounds. Thanks so much!\" —Joe\n\n“I use my lolo apps for the treadmill and elliptical EVERY day..one or the other....or BOTH!! I am a fanatic! They helped me lose 55 lbs!!” —Wendy\n\n“384lbs to 209lbs...Yes, an entire person (or more) worth of weight.” —Jim \n\n“Started at 241. Now at 205!!!! If I can do it with lolo burn so can others.” —Tom \n\n\"This is the best app I have on my phone. I use it daily and lost 50 pounds last year in 6 months. Excellent.\" —ChasMsnia\n\nFEATURES\n• BEAT-SYNC shifts the tempo of your music to perfectly match the pace of your feet.\n• Includes 24 tracks of high-energy music (2-CDs worth)!  \n• Use it on a treadmill or take it outside. Walk, walk-jog or run. \n• A real voice guides and motivates you through your workouts – not a scary computer voice. \n• Fill out your profile and BeatBurn designs the perfect program. \n• Your program progresses, every day is a new challenge. \n• Adjust your workout at anytime using the interactive graph. \n• Sync your workouts to the Health app.\n• Compatible with most bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n• Track your history and share your progress on Facebook or Twitter.  \n\nBEAT-SYNC \nThere's nothing quite like the feeling of moving to the beat of your favorite song. That Saturday Night Fever strut? (YouTube it, kids) We wanted to have that feeling during every workout, so we built BeatBurn to dynamically change the beat of YOUR music to perfectly match your pace. Trust us, your workouts will feel easier even though you're actually working harder and burning more calories.  \n\nINTERACTIVE PERSONAL TRAINER \nBeatBurn features an interactive personal trainer whose voice guides you through each workout, giving you the tips you need to get the most out of your workout and the motivation to keep going no matter how tough it gets. BeatBurn gives you complete control as you move through your workout. Turn the intensity down a bit when you're struggling or crank it up when you're ready for more, and your trainer adjusts your workout - and your music - on the fly.\n\nDESIGNED AROUND YOU \nWhether you're a beginner or an athlete, BeatBurn will design the perfect program to match your schedule and fitness level.  \n\nCHALLENGING \nBeatBurn workouts change up the intensity frequently to keep it fun and exciting and most importantly, to challenge your body. Each program uses a combination of intervals and pyramid training to mix up the intensity.  \n\nTRACKING \nIndoors or outdoors, BeatBurn keeps track of your speed and calories burned, so you always know if you're on track to hit your personal fitness goal.\n\nMULTITASKING \nBeatBurn runs perfectly in the background on supported devices.\n\nWorks with Health\n- Completed workouts sync to the Health app, including distance, calories burned and duration."

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

Based on the \"Scientific 7 Minute Workout\" originally published in ACSM's Health and Fitness Journal and seen in the NY Times, but improved upon by the expert trainers at lolo.\n\nOne size does not fit all so we took the principles of this fast and effective workout and tuned it so it could fit anyone's needs. Some people may find the original 7 Minute Workout too hard while others may find it too boring. We fine tuned this workout so anyone can get a safe, effective, and challenging workout, no matter their fitness level in just 7 minutes! \n\nEvery workout will be customized to your fitness level and to the equipment you have available. Each exercise includes a video you can view DURING YOUR WORKOUT, so that you can always double-check your form.\n\nFEATURES \n• Get a complete full body workout in just 7 minutes!\n• 3 skill levels designed for Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced exercisers.\n• Includes 200 unique exercises. Each one includes video, coaching points and audio guidance.\n• Works anywhere! With over 100 bodyweight exercises, you can get a complete full body workout no matter where you are.\n• lolo's beat-sync technology perfectly matches the tempo of your music to your workout.\n• Completely interactive. Swap out exercises to personalize your workouts. Increase or decreases the intensity at anytime and your trainer and your music will respond!\n• Sync your workouts to the Health app.\n• Compatible with most bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n\nBEAT-SYNC \n7 Minute Workout dynamically changes the beat of YOUR music to perfectly match your movements. Research shows that music distracts the brain during exercise and faster music causes people to accept and even prefer a greater degree of effort. This means you will work harder without trying (or without even feeling the difference), you will get better results from the increased effort, and most importantly, the time will fly by. \n\nlolo CONNECT\nlolo Connect allows you to save your fitness results to the cloud, track your progress across lolo apps, and share your success with friends and family through social media.\n\nINTERACTIVE PERSONAL TRAINER \n7 Minute Workout features an interactive personal trainer whose voice guides you through each workout, giving you the tips you need to get the most out of your workout and the motivation to keep going no matter how tough it gets. Plus you have complete control as you move through your workout. Turn the intensity down a bit when you're struggling or crank it up when you're ready for more, and your trainer adjusts your workout - and your music - on the fly."

      "label": "Think back to your childhood: wouldn't it have been wonderful to learn how to relax and stay calm in stressful situations when you were growing up?  \n\nYou can give your children this gift by meditating with them. If you're new to meditation, it may be intimidating at first, but don't worry - your child is likely a natural. When it comes to learning the art of meditation and guided imagery, children may truly have an advantage over adults - unbridled, beautiful imaginations.  \n\nCustomize with natural sounds and 10 helpful meditations including:\n* Breathing Relaxation for Kids\n* Worry and Anxiety\n* Deal With Everyday Stress\n* Decrease Fidgeting\n* Afraid of the Dark\n* Calm and Centered\n\nThis is good news for anyone interested in teaching their children how to relax and stay calm in stressful situations; skills they can carry well into adulthood. Meditation is something everyone in the family can benefit from practicing, and it's something you can do together. \n\nWhat is Meditation, Mindfulness & Guided Imagery?\n\nMeditation produces a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. When you meditate, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. \n\nSome research suggests that meditation may help people manage anxiety disorders, depression, high blood pressure, pain and sleep problems. \n\nThere are also emotional benefits of meditation, including: \n* Gaining a new perspective on stressful situations\n* Building skills to manage your stress\n* Increasing self-awareness\n* Focusing on the present\n* Reducing negative emotions\n\nMindfulness is a form of meditation rooted in spiritual teachings in which you focus your full attention on the present moment. You acknowledge what you feel and experience, and accept it, without judgment or criticism.\n\nRecent studies indicate that children who practice mindfulness show:\n\n* 24% increase in positive social behaviors\n* 24% decrease in aggression\n* 15% improvement in math scores\n* Reduction and prevention of depression-like symptoms\n* Improved classroom behavior, including self control, paying attention and showing respect for others\n\n\nGuided imagery is a way to access the images of the unconscious mind to help resolve problems and to gain greater insights and deeper understanding regarding a specific illness, issue, or situation. It may or may not be interactive and it usually uses prompted or suggested imagery. \n\nPlease note: In some cases, meditation can worsen symptoms associated with certain mental and physical health conditions. Be sure to consult your health care provider before meditating if you or your family members have any of these conditions.\n\nAs a key exercise in the mastery of meditation you will find that repetition brings a higher sense of peace and security."

BeatBurn Elliptical is the first Elliptical Trainer in the App Store, combining lolo's exclusive beat-sync technology with expert guidance from a personal trainer to put a whole new spin on your workout.\n\nbeat-sync analyzes the BPM (Beats Per Minute) of your music, selects the best songs from your iPod playlist to fit the intensity of your workout, then changes the beat on the fly, perfectly matching your pace.\n\n Why does this matter? How does it help you? Research shows that music distracts the brain during exercise and faster music causes people to accept and even prefer a greater degree of effort. This means:\n\n • You will work harder without trying (or without even feeling the difference), \n\n• You will get better results from the increased effort, \n\n• And most importantly, the time will fly by.\n\nFEATURES\n • beat-sync shifts the tempo of your music to match your pace.\n\n • Includes 24 tracks of high-energy music (2-CDs worth)! \n\n • A real voice guides and motivates you through your workouts – not a scary computer voice. \n\n• Fill out your profile and BeatBurn designs the perfect program. \n\n• Your program progresses, every day is a new challenge.\n\n• Set your pace by RPM or Strides per Minute. If your machine doesn't display either, don't worry, the beat of the music will set your pace for you. \n\n• Adjust your workout at anytime using the interactive graph. \n\n• Track your history and share your progress on Facebook or Twitter.\n\n• Retina Display support.\n\n• Bluetooth audio compatible.\n\n• Sync your workouts to the Health app.\n\n• Compatible with most bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n\nBEAT-SYNC\nThere's nothing quite like the feeling of moving to the beat of your favorite song. That Saturday Night Fever strut? (YouTube it, kids) We wanted to have that feeling during every workout, so we built BeatBurn to dynamically change the beat of YOUR music to perfectly match your pace. Trust us, your workouts will feel easier even though you're actually working harder and burning more calories.  \n\nSMART PLAYLIST\nBeatBurn continuously analyzes your workout and picks the best songs to drive you through a great workout.\n\nINTERACTIVE PERSONAL TRAINER\nBeatBurn features an interactive personal trainer whose voice guides you through each workout, giving you the tips you need to get the most out of your workout and the motivation to keep going no matter how tough it gets. BeatBurn gives you complete control as you move through your workout. Turn the intensity down a bit when you're struggling or crank it up when you're ready for more, and your trainer adjusts your workout - and your music - on the fly.\n\nDESIGNED AROUND YOU\nWhether you're a beginner or an athlete, BeatBurn will design the perfect program to match your schedule and fitness level.  \n\nCHALLENGING\nBeatBurn workouts change up the intensity frequently to keep it fun and exciting and most importantly, to challenge your body. Each program uses a combination of intervals and pyramid training to mix up the intensity.\n\n  TRACKING\nBeatBurn keeps track of your intensity and calories burned, so you always know if you're on track to hit your personal fitness goal.\n\nSOCIAL SHARING\nYour personal network is key to reaching your goals. Share your successes with them through Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or Email.\n\nWorks with Health\n- Completed workouts sync to the Health app, including distance, calories burned and duration."

Select style, mode, source and color, and even what the widgets should open when tapping on them. \n\nYou can choose up to 11 different layout styles, from small to medium sized widgets, making the combination you want for your home screen.\n\nThis app uses HeathKit to obtain information about your movement, weight, oxygen levels, blood glucose, sleep and heart beat values, should you consent the app to do so upon launch. \n\nNote: the update frequency of the widgets depend on the iOS itself, not controllable by the app. The operating system will decide how often the widgets need to refresh, but you can force refresh them by entering the Hidgets app once and go back to the home screen.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me at schmitzoide@gmail.com or visit the website https://hidgets.com.\n\nThank you so much for your support! \n\nWith love from Portugal,\nMarcel"

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

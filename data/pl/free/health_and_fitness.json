      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

We recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you’re doing activities such as running or biking.\n\nPlease get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits.

      "label": "Get daily exercise videos, nutrition profiles, and emotional insights customized to your body’s natural cycle. \n\n28 is the world’s first cycle-based fitness and wellness experience offering cycle tracking, transformative exercises, nutrition profiles, and science-backed emotional insights, all hyper-personalized to where you are in your natural cycle and controlled by you.\n\nDesigned by supermodel trainers and medical experts to work with your body’s physical and hormonal fluctuations. Powered by nature and innovative technology that personalizes your daily experience while keeping you in control of your cycle data.\n\n\nPainful Periods Aren't Natural\n\n\nBut they are common. Synthetic estrogens in birth control, plastics, and beauty products have created hormone imbalances for millions of women. 28's functional nutrition was designed to naturally restore balance to your hormones, along with phase-specific functional movements. \n\nWorkout With Your Cycle, Not Against It\n\n\nMany popular fitness methods were designed for men, not women, with no regard for the menstrual cycle. 28 is the first method of its kind designed to optimize your energy, hormones, strength, and flexibility as you experience changes throughout your cycle.\n\nYou Deserve More Than A Period Tracker\n\nYour cycle has four phases. Each phase brings changes to the brain and body. Exercising and eating based on your cycle means changing the types of movements and nutrients during each phase to optimize your physique, hormones, and mood. 28 empowers you with simplified science, breathtaking content, and cutting-edge technology. \n\nBecome the Expert of You\n\n\nYou are a mystery. Your body doesn’t have to be. We’ve been locked in the passenger seats of our own bodies for far too long. School taught us little-to-nothing about how our cycles and hormones actually work. 28 empowers you to connect with your body by understanding the beautifully complex nature of your biology, one day at a time.\n\n\n\nFEATURES: \n\nFollow Your Cycle\n  - Daily Cycle Status\n  - Easily Track Your Periods\n  - Phase Progress Bar \n\nScience-based Insights\n  - Daily body predictions\n  - Daily emotional predictions\n  - Goals, Guidance, and inspiration\n\nExercise Videos\n  - Personalized to match your energy and mood\n  - Designed by trainers of iconic supermodels\n  - Lengthen, strengthen, stretch & tone\n  - Sculpt booty, tighten abs, tone arms, lean legs\n  - Workout anywhere, at any time\n  - No equipment required\n  - Lightening-fast, high-definition streaming\n  - View on mobile, desktop, tablet, TV\n\nNutrition Profiles\n  - Daily nutrition guidelines for hormone balancing\n  - Specific suggestions by food groups \n  - Give your body what it needs, when it needs it\n  - No more calorie counting\n  - Coming Soon: Meal plans\n  - Coming soon: Shopping lists\n\nUser Privacy Is Our #1 Priority\n\nMany women have valid concerns regarding the privacy and safety of their personal health data. We're proud to have one of the strongest privacy policies in all of tech, which includes a steadfast commitment to never sell user cycle data to anyone for any reason and to never turn over user cycle data to any government or regulatory authority under any circumstance. We've intentionally built our algorithm to be manually controlled by the user at any time, as opposed to leveraging more invasive, machine learning methods. The only cycle data we currently collect is provided voluntarily by the user. It is also never shared with any existing or future investors. It is strictly confidential and used only for the purposes of providing a customized user experience. Any cycle data the user provides now or in the future can be changed or deleted by the user at any time. We do not store deleted cycle data. Once the user deletes that information, it is gone forever.\n\nEmbrace your nature and begin today!"

      "label": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\r\n\r\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

Zdobywaj umiejętności, których nie nauczono Cię w szkole. Zrelaksuj się i popraw koncentrację. Wzmocnij kondycję mentalną tak, jak ćwiczysz mięśnie.\n\n\n*** WIEDZA I ĆWICZENIA ROZWIJAJĄCE ŻYCIOWE UMIEJĘTNOŚCI *** \nOdkryj kursy z wiedzą, której zabrakło w szkołach. Jak radzić sobie mądrze ze stresem? Co oznacza budowanie trwałych relacji? Jak rozwijać się w roli rodzica? Dlaczego mózg potrafi płatać Ci figle? Dlaczego dieta nie działa, jeśli nie uzdrowisz głowy? Jak wykorzystać w swoim zyciu trening mentalny najlepszych sportowców?\n\n*** RELAKSACJE I NAGRANIA NA SEN *** \nOdpręż się w ciągu dnia, korzystając ze znanych technik relaksacyjnych. Przez krainę odpoczynku poprowadzą Cię wyjątkowe głosy, w tym samego Piotra Fronczewskiego. Skorzystaj z nagrań dla łatwiejszego zasypiania i zdrowszego snu. \n\n*** MEDYTACJA, TRENING UWAŻNOŚCI, ĆWICZENIA ODDECHOWE *** \nTo nie magia, tylko nauka - bezwysiłkowy trening dla Twojej głowy. Naucz się medytacji w kursach i prowadzonych praktykach. Z Mindy krótka chwila medytacji stanie się nawykiem (jak codzienne mycie zębów).  Poznaj również wyjątkowe ćwiczenia oddechowe. Swój umysł możesz trenować, tak jak mięśnie.\n\n*** AUTOTERAPIA LUB SAMODZIELNY COACHING *** \nPoznaj lepiej siebie, swoje myśli, emocje i mechanizmy. Włącz interaktywne programy przygotowane przez psychologów i terapeutów. A może chcesz popracować nad swoimi celami i rozwinąć potencjał w procesie podobnym do pracy coachingowej?\n\n*** WYJĄTKOWA MUZYKA *** \nWłącz tryb spokojnej i skoncentrowanej głowy z muzyką w Mindy. Autorskie nagrania pomogą Ci skupić uwagę lub zrelaksować ciało i umysł. Wykorzystaj niezwykłą moc muzyki tworzonej tak, by pracowała dla Twojego mózgu.\n\n\nNaukowo potwierdzone metody dla wszystkich, którzy:\n- mają się dobrze i chcą dalej rozwijać samych siebie, zdobywać nowe umiejętności\n- miewają trudniejsze momenty i aktywnie dążą do szczęśliwszego, zdrowszego życia\n- borykają się z gorszym stanem mentalnym i szukają dodatkowego wsparcia* w dowolnym czasie, zawsze pod ręką.\n\n*Pamiętaj, że aplikacja nigdy nie zastąpi wizyty u specjalisty zdrowia psychicznego. Jeśli odczuwasz duże trudności, zawsze skorzystaj ze specjalistycznej pomocy.\n\nRozwijaj swój umysł. Zamień stres na spokój z Mindy. Żyj szczęśliwie i zdrowo.\n\n\nCENY I WARUNKI SUBSKRYPCJI\n\nMożesz korzystać z wersji bezpłatnej Mindy z ograniczoną liczbą dostępnych treści. \n\nAby odblokować dostęp do wszystkich zasobów, wybierz automatycznie odnawialne formy subskrypcji:\n- kwartalnej w cenie 69,99 zł\n- rocznej w cenie 239,99 zł\n\nPodane w aplikacji ceny obowiązują dla subskrybentów z Polski. Ceny w pozostałych krajach mogą się różnić i mają na to wpływ m.in. różnice kursów walut. \n\nJednorazowo możesz skorzystać z okresu próbnego subskrypcji premium, podczas którego możesz anulować subskrypcję bez realizowania płatności.\n\nSubskrypcja będzie odnawiać się w sposób automatyczny. Aby uniknąć pobrania opłaty za kolejny miesiąc korzystania z Mindy, należy anulować subskrypcję na m.in. 24h przed upłynięciem obecnego okresu subskrypcji. Możesz tego dokonać w ustawieniach konta w aplikacji App Store.\n\n\nPolitykę Prywatności (Privacy Policy) znajdziesz tutaj: https://www.mindyapp.pl/privacy-policy\n\nWarunki korzystania z usługi (Terms of use) znajdziesz tutaj: https://www.mindyapp.pl/terms-conditions"

      "label": "Get to a healthier and more active life with Google Fit!\n\nIt’s hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps.

      "label": "Dieta dr Ewy Dąbrowskiej odmieniła życie tysięcy osób na lepsze. Nie chcesz tracić czasu na codzienne zastanawianie się, które produkty są dozwolone, a które nie — wypróbuj jadłospis w formie oficjalnej aplikacji, autoryzowanej przez Instytut Promocji Zdrowia dr Ewy Dąbrowskiej! \n\nNOWOŚĆ! Post przerywany (Intermittent Fasting) już w aplikacji. IF to elastyczna metoda żywienia polegająca na przyjmowaniu pożywienia tylko przez określony czas dnia i poszczeniu przez pozostały okres. Całość można dostosować indywidualnie. Do wyboru jest kilka opcji czasowych (14:10, 16:8, 18:6), a w zależności od stopnia zaawansowania, zawsze można dokonać zmiany przedziału czasowego okna i postu. \n\nAplikacja dr Ewy Dąbrowskiej to coś więcej, niż sam POST. Pełen program Diety dr Ewy Dąbrowskiej to łatwy sposób na zmianę nawyków żywieniowych. Do jego etapów zalicza się: \nPrzygotowanie do postu — w przyjemny sposób przygotuj organizm na wyzwanie, jakim jest częściowy post. \nPost warzywno-owocowy — uruchom wewnętrzne siły organizmu, oczyszczanie i spalanie tłuszczu trzewnego. To nie głodówka! Jesz warzywa i owoce w odpowiednich proporcjach. Dostępne aż 2 opcje! Maksymalny czas trwania postu z aplikacją to 14 dni.\nWyjście z postu — prosto i bezpiecznie, bez efektu jo-jo. \nZdrowe odżywianie (zdrowa dieta) — utrwal efekty i jedz pysznie każdego dnia. \n\nTo wszystko krok po kroku w 1 aplikacji! W ramach pełnego programu pomożemy Ci przygotować się do postu, przejść przez niego oraz wyjść i jednocześnie zbudować zdrowe nawyki żywieniowe na dłużej. \n\nINDYWIDUALNE DOPASOWANIE\nKażdy z nas jest inny: różnimy się od siebie doświadczeniami, stylem życia i upodobaniami kulinarnymi. Aplikacja pozwoli dostosować jadłospis do Twoich indywidualnych potrzeb. \n\nPOLSKA DIETA\n90% warzyw i owoców oraz innych produktów potrzebnych do gotowania z aplikacją pochodzi z polskich sadów i upraw. Pozostałych 10% to popularne, również powszechnie dostępne produkty.\n\nPROSTY POST \nOpcja dostępna tylko w aplikacji. Jadłospis w prostym poście skupia się głównie na surowych warzywach, kiełkach oraz superzdrowych produktach kiszonych w prostym wydaniu: surówki, koktajle i dania jednogarnkowe. Oznacza to mniej czasu spędzonego w kuchni, te same efekty jak w przypadku postu klasycznego oraz prostsze menu. \n\nOPCJE WEGETARIAŃSKIE \nWszystkie fazy diety dopasowane zostały do wegetarian. W tej wersji czeka aż 560 przepisów! To 4 pełnowartościowe posiłki dziennie skomponowane tak, by zadbać o odpowiednią podaż zdrowych białek i tłuszczów. \n\nZA CO JESZCZE UŻYTKOWNICZKI I UŻYTKOWNICY KOCHAJĄ APLIKACJĘ DR EWY DĄBROWSKIEJ? \nIntuicyjne użycie,\n100% wiedzy z oficjalnych książek o diecie Dr Dąbrowskiej, \nPorady i wykłady dr Ewy Dąbrowskiej — to nigdzie niepublikowana wiedza, dostępna tylko dla korzystających z aplikacji, \nProfesjonalna i bezpłatna opieka dietetyczna podczas diety — to kontakt z certyfikowanymi dietetykami 24/7 i możliwość uzyskania odpowiedzi na każde pytanie,\nMożliwość wymiany składników i przepisów — to komfort wyboru i jedzenia w zgodzie ze sobą i własnymi upodobaniami, \nLista zakupów — to ułatwienie Twojego życia od pierwszych dni korzystania z diety i aplikacji, czyli gotowy spis produktów, które musisz kupić, \nŁatwe przepisy — to dzięki nim zrzucisz zbędne kilogramy, oczyścisz organizm z toksyn, będziesz mieć więcej energii. \n\nOpłata za dostęp do aplikacji będzie pobierana zgodnie z wybraną subskrypcją. Płatność zostanie automatycznie pobrana, chyba że zostanie wyłączona przynajmniej 24 godziny przed zakończeniem okresu abonamentowego. Subskrypcjami można zarządzać w Ustawieniach.\n\nDieta jest zgodna z zaleceniami żywienia, o których możesz przeczytać w publikacjach naukowych. Odwiedź https://app.ewadabrowska.com.pl/info lub zakładkę \"Info\" w aplikacji.\n\nAplikacja nie jest produktem medycznym. Przed rozpoczęciem diety skontaktuj się z lekarzem, który upewni Cię, że nie ma żadnych przeciwwskazań do stosowania diety.\n\nRegulamin: https://app.ewadabrowska.com.pl/terms-of-service"

Dowolnie komponuj przepisy w aplikacji Respo i korzystaj z interaktywnej listy zakupów. \n\nĆwiczenia Respo\nTrening dopasowany do Twoich możliwości, czasu i miejsca. Ćwicz tak jak lubisz!

Aplikacja mobilna zapewnia Wam łatwy kontakt gdzie i kiedy chcesz. Motywacja, monitorowanie postępów, dzielenie się wiedzą – wszystko po to, by zrealizować Twój cel.\n\nZdrowe nawyki \nZdrowe odżywianie nigdy nie było tak proste i przyjemne! Zmiana nawyków żywieniowych to gwarancja, że zrzucone kilogramy już nie wrócą. Zyskasz lepsze samopoczucie i więcej energii.\n\nJak działa Centrum Respo?\n1. Na początku wypełnij formularz żywieniowo-treningowy. Opowiedz o swoich preferencjach, stylu życia, ulubionych potrawach i stanie zdrowia. Określ cel, jaki chcesz osiągnąć. Na podstawie tych informacji Opiekun Twojego Celu, czyli przypisany do Ciebie dietetyk, przygotuje jadłospis na 7 dni wraz z listą zakupów.\n2. Jeśli masz pytania dotyczące Twojej diety czy aktywności fizycznej lub chcesz coś zmienić w diecie, śmiało pisz na chacie do Twojego Opiekuna.\n3. Co dwa tygodnie Opiekun analizuje Twoje wyniki w specjalnym raporcie, który wypełniasz. Na jego podstawie wie, jak Ci idzie i co pomoże Ci w metamorfozie.\n3. Dostęp do planu żywieniowego i ćwiczeń jest możliwy w trakcie trwania współpracy. Jeśli chcesz zachować ciągłość diety i pomiarów, przedłuż współpracę przed jej końcem.\n\nDlaczego warto?\nWyobraź sobie: skuteczna dieta bez efektu jojo.

Za pośrednictwem aplikacji mobilnej CityFit klubowicze mogą m.in. zarządzać swoim członkostwem oraz zapisywać się na zajęcia fitness i trening personalny. Umożliwia ona również zakup produktów dodatkowych, takich jak pakiet medyczny w Medicover czy cegiełka charytatywna. W kolejnym etapie aplikacja wzbogacona zostanie o funkcje umożliwiające zakup karnetu. Istotnym elementem aplikacji jest oparty na idei grywalizacji program lojalnościowy FitFighters. Biorąc udział w wyzwaniach sportowych klubowicze zdobywają CityFitCoiny, uprawniające m.in. do rabatów na członkostwo w klubie. Równolegle ich konta wzbogacają się o kolejne punkty przy atrybutach: siła, morale, wytrzymałość i szybkość. Zdobycie odpowiedniej ilości punktów kieruje użytkownika na kolejny poziom treningowy. Nazwy poziomów nawiązują do zwierząt i są to odpowiednio: dla kobiet - Wiewiórka, Gazela, Pantera; dla mężczyzn - Zając, Dzik, Byk."

Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations not only do they help make major shifts in your mindset they also serve as prompts and daily reminders on what you are truly capable of, making sure you have an amazing day, everyday.\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your unconscious mind and your conscious mind.\nThe more you strengthen this connection the more resilient you will be when difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe.\n\nAnd the best way strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\nThere are so many benefits of using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words making it easier to recognize the negative + self-doubt thought patterns holding you back. \n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n\nTo have access to the \"I am Premium\" content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

We recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you’re doing activities such as running or biking.\n\nPlease get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits.

      "label": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\r\n\r\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "Dieta dr Ewy Dąbrowskiej odmieniła życie tysięcy osób na lepsze. Nie chcesz tracić czasu na codzienne zastanawianie się, które produkty są dozwolone, a które nie — wypróbuj jadłospis w formie oficjalnej aplikacji, autoryzowanej przez Instytut Promocji Zdrowia dr Ewy Dąbrowskiej! \n\nNOWOŚĆ! Post przerywany (Intermittent Fasting) już w aplikacji. IF to elastyczna metoda żywienia polegająca na przyjmowaniu pożywienia tylko przez określony czas dnia i poszczeniu przez pozostały okres. Całość można dostosować indywidualnie. Do wyboru jest kilka opcji czasowych (14:10, 16:8, 18:6), a w zależności od stopnia zaawansowania, zawsze można dokonać zmiany przedziału czasowego okna i postu. \n\nAplikacja dr Ewy Dąbrowskiej to coś więcej, niż sam POST. Pełen program Diety dr Ewy Dąbrowskiej to łatwy sposób na zmianę nawyków żywieniowych. Do jego etapów zalicza się: \nPrzygotowanie do postu — w przyjemny sposób przygotuj organizm na wyzwanie, jakim jest częściowy post. \nPost warzywno-owocowy — uruchom wewnętrzne siły organizmu, oczyszczanie i spalanie tłuszczu trzewnego. To nie głodówka! Jesz warzywa i owoce w odpowiednich proporcjach. Dostępne aż 2 opcje! Maksymalny czas trwania postu z aplikacją to 14 dni.\nWyjście z postu — prosto i bezpiecznie, bez efektu jo-jo. \nZdrowe odżywianie (zdrowa dieta) — utrwal efekty i jedz pysznie każdego dnia. \n\nTo wszystko krok po kroku w 1 aplikacji! W ramach pełnego programu pomożemy Ci przygotować się do postu, przejść przez niego oraz wyjść i jednocześnie zbudować zdrowe nawyki żywieniowe na dłużej. \n\nINDYWIDUALNE DOPASOWANIE\nKażdy z nas jest inny: różnimy się od siebie doświadczeniami, stylem życia i upodobaniami kulinarnymi. Aplikacja pozwoli dostosować jadłospis do Twoich indywidualnych potrzeb. \n\nPOLSKA DIETA\n90% warzyw i owoców oraz innych produktów potrzebnych do gotowania z aplikacją pochodzi z polskich sadów i upraw. Pozostałych 10% to popularne, również powszechnie dostępne produkty.\n\nPROSTY POST \nOpcja dostępna tylko w aplikacji. Jadłospis w prostym poście skupia się głównie na surowych warzywach, kiełkach oraz superzdrowych produktach kiszonych w prostym wydaniu: surówki, koktajle i dania jednogarnkowe. Oznacza to mniej czasu spędzonego w kuchni, te same efekty jak w przypadku postu klasycznego oraz prostsze menu. \n\nOPCJE WEGETARIAŃSKIE \nWszystkie fazy diety dopasowane zostały do wegetarian. W tej wersji czeka aż 560 przepisów! To 4 pełnowartościowe posiłki dziennie skomponowane tak, by zadbać o odpowiednią podaż zdrowych białek i tłuszczów. \n\nZA CO JESZCZE UŻYTKOWNICZKI I UŻYTKOWNICY KOCHAJĄ APLIKACJĘ DR EWY DĄBROWSKIEJ? \nIntuicyjne użycie,\n100% wiedzy z oficjalnych książek o diecie Dr Dąbrowskiej, \nPorady i wykłady dr Ewy Dąbrowskiej — to nigdzie niepublikowana wiedza, dostępna tylko dla korzystających z aplikacji, \nProfesjonalna i bezpłatna opieka dietetyczna podczas diety — to kontakt z certyfikowanymi dietetykami 24/7 i możliwość uzyskania odpowiedzi na każde pytanie,\nMożliwość wymiany składników i przepisów — to komfort wyboru i jedzenia w zgodzie ze sobą i własnymi upodobaniami, \nLista zakupów — to ułatwienie Twojego życia od pierwszych dni korzystania z diety i aplikacji, czyli gotowy spis produktów, które musisz kupić, \nŁatwe przepisy — to dzięki nim zrzucisz zbędne kilogramy, oczyścisz organizm z toksyn, będziesz mieć więcej energii. \n\nOpłata za dostęp do aplikacji będzie pobierana zgodnie z wybraną subskrypcją. Płatność zostanie automatycznie pobrana, chyba że zostanie wyłączona przynajmniej 24 godziny przed zakończeniem okresu abonamentowego. Subskrypcjami można zarządzać w Ustawieniach.\n\nDieta jest zgodna z zaleceniami żywienia, o których możesz przeczytać w publikacjach naukowych.

      "label": "Are you trying to quit smoking? If you are finding it hard to stop smoking, QuitNow is made for you.\n\nFirst things first: you know smoking is bad for your body. Even so, lots of people keep smoking. So why should you quit? When you quit smoking, you improve the quality and length of your life and the lives of the people around you. One way to prepare to successfully launch your smoke-free life is to power up your phone with QuitNow.\n\nQuitNow is a proven app that engages you to quit smoking. It aims to avoid tobacco just by giving you a picture of yourself. Quitting smoking is easier when you focus your effort on these four sections:\n\n- Your ex-smoker status: When you quit smoking, the focus has to be on you. Remember the day you quitted and get the maths: how many days are you free of smoke, how much money you saved, and how many cigarettes you avoided.\n\n- Achievements: your quit smoking motivations: As with all tasks in life, quitting smoking is easier when you divide the task into small and easy ones. So, QuitNow offers you 70 goals based on the cigarettes you avoided, the days since your last cigarette, and the money saved. So, you will start celebrating achievements from the first day.\n\n- Community: the ex-smokers chat: When you quit smoking, you need to stay within the non-smoking areas. QuitNow offers a chat full of people that, like you, said goodbye to tobacco. Spending time with nonsmokers will make your way easier.\n\n- Your ex-smoker health: QuitNow offers a list of health indicators to explain how your body improves day by day. They are based in the World Health Organization ones, and we update them as soon as the W.H.O. does.\n\n\nIn addition, there are more sections in the preferences screen that could help you in your way to quitting smoking.\n\n- Frequent Asked Questions: there are some tips to quit smoking, and honestly, we don’t know where to put them. Most quitters look for tips on the internet, and there are lots of fake tips there. We researched in the World Health Organization archives to find the investigations they made and the conclusions they had. In the Frequent Asked Questions, you will find all the answers to those questions you have about quitting smoking.\n\n- The QuitNow bot: sometimes, you have strange questions that don’t appear in the F.A.Q. In those cases, you can ask the bot: we train her to answer those strange ones. If she doesn’t have a good answer, she will contact the QuitNow crew and they will update their knowledge base, so she will learn the best answers to your questions. By the way, yes: all the bot answers are extracted from the W.H.O. archives, as the F.A.Q. tips.\n\n- Books to quit smoking: knowing some techniques about quitting smoking makes the task easier. There's always someone talking about books in the chat, so we made an investigation to know which are the most popular, and which ones can actually help you to quit smoking for good.\n\n\nDo you have any idea to make QuitNow even better? If so, please do write to us at ios@fewlaps.com\n\nTerms of Service: https://tos.quitnow.app/eula\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://tos.quitnow.app/privacypolicy"

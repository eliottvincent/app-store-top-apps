      "label": "Want to display or send SSTV transmissions, without using a bulky computer? SSTV Pad lets you decode and display Ham (Amateur) Radio SSTV (Slow Scan TV) transmissions. Just connect your device to an HF radio (or even set it next to the radio's speaker), tune in an SSTV frequency, and watch the pictures. SSTV Pad decodes all of the popular SSTV modes, including Robot, Scottie, Martin, and more. Some modes are receive only. \n\nDecoding of SSTV transmissions begins automatically as soon as the start of image audio signals are detected, and the image format is automatically selected. Manual control is also available for use when receiving conditions are poor. Timing signals (phase and skew) can be adjusted to compensate for mismatches with the sending station. \n\nReceived images can be saved - including automatically as they are received. You can leave the app running unattended, and come back to view all the received images. You can review saved images, as well as send them via email, and use iTunes file sharing to transfer them to your computer. You can even share them on your Facebook page, or tweet them to your followers, directly from the app! (iOS 6 and later)\n\nYou can also transmit images, taken from your saved photos or taken with your device's camera. Text, such as your callsign, can be added to the sent image.\n\nBuy your copy right now, and start decoding and displaying SSTV transmissions in minutes. Just set your iPhone or iPad next to the radio speaker, and watch the pictures come rolling in.\n\nNote: If you cannot see the transmit button, go to the Accessibility settings for your device and turn Button Shapes OFF. It makes the buttons too large so you cannot see them all. \n\nAlso, It is very important to have a well tuned signal of good quality, and make sure you get the audio from your radio to your device without adding additional distortion, or auto start and mode detect will not work optimally. Please see this page for tips on using the app and connecting your radio: http://www.blackcatsystems.com/ipad/iPad_SSTV_Pad_FAQ.html\n\nYou can also use Bluetooth audio devices to feed audio into your device. Please be sure to use a good quality Bluetooth device, that does not distort the audio.\n\nModes supported for reception (not all modes can be transmitted):\nB&W 8 sec\nB&W 12 sec\nB&W 24 sec\nB&W 36 sec \nMartin M1\nMartin M1\nMartin M2\nMartin M3\nMartin M4\nMP73\" \nMP115 \nMP140 \nMP175\nMR73 \nMR90\nMR115 \nMR140 \nMR175 \nPD 50\nPD 90 \nPD 120 \nPD 160\nPD 180\nPD 240\nPD 290 \nRobot 12C\nRobot 24C\nRobot 36C\nRobot 72C\nSC-1 32 sec\nSC-1 16 sec\nSC-1 8 sec\nSC-2-60\nSC-2-120\nSC-2-180\nScottie S1\nScottie S2\nScottie S3\nScottie S4\nScottie DX"

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

An alarm that irritates me enough to wake up\n √ Exceptional App!! This app is super super annoying... It really gets me out of bed\n √ Love it. It's the best alarm ever\n √ Great Alarm! Been having trouble getting up. No more!\n √ This app is so easy to use, and has all the perfect functions! I'll never be late again!\n\nFEATURED IN THE MEDIA\n √ Definitely one of the more “annoying” alarms to help you get up and out of bed in the morning. – AppAdvice.com\n √ If you are the kind of person who has a difficult time waking up after you’ve turned off your alarm, this app may help keep you from being late for work. - iDownloadBlog\n\nAlso in MacWorld NL, AppsRumors, AppChronicles, etc.\n\nHOW IT WORKS \n\nAs the name \"Step Out!\" implied, the only way you can turn off this alarm clock is STEPPING out of your bed (you still can snooze - in a limited duration). It uses advanced image recognition and step tracking technologies to check whether you’re far away from your bed. \n\nAfter ringing, the app asks you to capture another photo of a specified place, it should be where you usually be every time you wake up, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, ... So you just take a photo and do your routine work like washing your face or preparing breakfast. \n\nAnother alternative is using the step counter, which simplifies this process into just nothing. You wake up and go to wherever you want with the device. After reaching enough number of steps, the alarm will automatically turn off. It’s simply a smarter alarm with no additional action., You’ll love using it from the very first time. \n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n\n- MUSIC ALARM \no Wake up with your favorite songs\no Listen to them when moving\n\n- FULLY FUNCTIONAL ALARM \no Easy setup with hand-drawn mini-game\no Repeating rule for daily, weekly alarms \no Built-in alarm sounds \no Snooze, Vibrate, Fade-in & Volume for the perfect experience \n\n- MOTION TRACKING \no Innovative motion tracking system to sense your steps\no Smart anti-cheat system to make sure that you are stepping\n\n**IMPORTANT: We do not encourage our users to step so fast when you are not totally awake, this app will just recognize the steps when you aren’t walking too fast.\n\n- IMAGE RECOGNITION\no State-of-the-art image recognizing engine\no Can match both horizontal and vertical pictures\no Strict image comparison to assure you’re leaving your bed and your eyes opened wide enough to take the right picture.\n\n**HINT: Choose a scene that has a stable light condition for better matching results.\n\n- SLEEP TIMER \no Fall asleep with music \no Auto-lock and ready for next alarm \n\n- FLASHLIGHT \no Easy to find way through the dark when you are stepping\n\n- CLOCK \no Full feature clock \no Show/hide seconds, 24 hour format, …"

All you need to know is one of the sizes — the application will tell the rest. Making a shopping trip to another country, online purchasing and an unexpected gift to your beloved will be easier when you can convert sizes on the go.\n\nWhy do we make Sizer?\n\nToday there is no easy way to order clothes online and be sure that it will fit on you well. Size charts do not help, because the size varies and depends on the brand, season, style and region. Size is the reason for the return of 30% of purchased goods online.\n\nSizer is designed to solve this problem - a smart algorithm that learns based on user data:\n1) be brave in online shopping;\n2) forget about returns;\n3) save shopping from stress.\n\n\nHow does Sizer work?\n\n1. You select sizes with the help of our algorithm.\n2. With the help of a button you give feedback - fit or didn’t fit.\n3. Sizer teaches the sizing algorithm.\n\nShopping is no longer a lottery with Sizer.\n\n\n\"An application that remembers that last year your jeans were two sizes smaller.\"\nGQ Russia\n\n\"You could've just said \"We have Beautiful Pixels!\".

A choc-mint-liqueur free zone. Bottoms up!\"\n\n- Wall Street Journal - Eric Felten\nIf you're just browsing, hunting for something tasty to try, how do you narrow your selections down to a manageable lot? One iPhone app, Cocktails Made Easy, solves that problem admirably...\n\nFeatures\n- 500+ Easy to follow cocktail recipes.\n- All recipes can be made with just 14 key ingredients.\n- All recipes accompanied by a FULL screen colour photograph.\n- All cocktails contain a comment and rating form top British drinks aficionado Simon Difford.\n- Every necessary ingredient listed including all fruits and mixers.\n- Add your own cocktails rating.\n- Add your own cocktail notes.\n- Create your personal favourite cocktail list.\n- Mark bottles you already own in the 'Cocktail Cabinet' to see which drinks you can make.\n- Shake the iPhone or iPod Touch for a random cocktail recipe.\n- Search for cocktails by either name, rating or ingredients.\n- View all screens in Landscape or Portrait mode.\n- Email recipes to your friends.\n- 'Pin' a cocktail to stop the iPhone/iPod Touch from going to sleep.\n- 'Pin' a cocktail when passing the iPhone/iPod Touch to stop cocktail recipe changing (through Shake feature).\n- Help screens available throughout the application through 'Info' button.\n- Operates without an internet connection.\n\nWhat customers are saying :-\n\n5 Star - Simon Difford DELIVERS \n(US iTunes Review Tiki Bar TV)\n....Simon's books blend masterful mixology with absolutely gorgeous graphic design...... this app has the same classy design and fantastic cocktails as Simon's books. The writing is clean and witty. The drinks? Delicious. \n\n5 Star - Fantastic!! \n(UK iTunes review)\nI didn't think that this application would be up to the same standard set by the book (which is THE definitive cocktail bible), but I couldn't have been more wrong! It's every bit as informative as the book, and the fact that it's interactive - it lists the cocktails that you can make from the drinks in your cabinet - makes it even easier to use. And at the price of half a pint of beer, it's astonishingly under-priced for such a brilliant application.\n\n5 Star - Marvelous \n(UK iTunes review)\nLooks as good as the books, fits in the pocket......."

      "label": "7 Advanced Binaural Dream Induction Programs in One App!  Dream Inducer combines soothing ambient sounds with powerful binaural sequences to synchronize your brainwaves with frequencies associated with 7 different levels of dreaming. * Universal iOS App for iPhone/Pad * Headphones or Earbuds must be worn for binaural tones to be effective.\n\n* Each program includes a sleep induction phase and then introduces progressively higher frequency Alpha, Beta, and Theta dream sequences to stimulate increasingly vivid dreams.\n\n* To combine Brainwaves and Ambience with Audio from Another App use the 'Ambience + Other App' background mode.\n\n* To use just Brainwaves and Audio from Another App use the \"Other App\" option for the Background Mode.\n\n** How Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Works **\nThrough the process of brainwave entrainment human brainwave frequencies can be synchronized with a  frequency associated with a target mental state.  These Brainwave frequencies are too low for the human ear to hear, however, these low-frequencies can be perceived by the human brain if two different audible frequencies are played separately into each ear with headphones or earbuds.  For example, the human ear can't directly perceive the 2 Hz Delta-wave frequency associated with deep sleep, but if you wear headphones with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 137 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 2 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat.  As you listen, your brainwaves will begin to match that frequency, inducing the associated mental state.\n\nDream Inducer improves upon basic binaural techniques by layering multiple signals and then assembling these into sequences of programs that combine to create extremely unique experiences."

As you listen your brainwaves fall into step with this inaudible beat, and after several minutes synchronize with the target frequency. \n\nBrain Wave Altered State uses the most advanced multi-stage binaural sequences available, combined with the flexibility to choose from a range of relaxing ambient backgrounds, other audio apps, or your own iTunes Music, allowing your mind you to relax and synchronize with your desired state.

Created for easy reading and markup of cross-stitch patterns, to speed up the needlework process.\n\nCross Stitch Saga is an embroidery tool for working with the interactive cross-stitch pattern.\n\nThe application produces an interactive cross-stitch pattern from source files of pattern making programs:\n\n• Pattern Maker v.4 (XSD)\n• XSPro Platinum (XSP)\n• PC Stitch v.6-10 (PAT)\n• Win/MacStitch (OXS)\n• Cross-stitch pattern designers and embroidery kit stores distribute an interactive pattern format (SAGA)\n\nNote: the application doesn't open patterns from PDF documents nor raster/vector file formats (JPEG, PNG, AI, etc.).\n\n• The application opens an interactive pattern with the different configurations of stitch types (cross, half-cross, quarter cross, petit, oblong, backstitch, long stitch, french knot, decorative stitches) and beads.\n\n• The application is suitable for various methods of cross-stitching, such as \"parking method\", \"cross country method\", for complex patterns with backstitch, etc.\n\n• The application keeps a detailed calendar of cross-stitching statistics on your markups in the pattern.\n\n• The application supports the installation of additional user fonts.\n\n• The application works in both landscape and portrait orientation provided that auto-rotation is enabled on the device.\n\n- Add cross-stitch patterns of allowed file formats to the application from the e-mail, website, or via the Cloud service\n- Use the built-in calculator to estimate materials (fabric, floss, and beads)\n- Mark what is already stitched (color up or erase) in a convenient way\n- Instantly navigate through the pattern, scale without loss of quality\n- Rotate or mirror-flip a pattern\n- Control the visibility of stitches on a pattern: highlight, isolate the necessary elements of the pattern, turn off the layers according to their types\n- Instantly get all the information about each pattern element (type, color, number of threads, blended floss content)\n- Sort the floss in the pattern legend list by the number of stitches remaining\n- Customize the appearance of the pattern — set any color of the symbols, stitch fills, grids, background, diagonal and zigzag guides, borders and background of the isolated cross-stitch area, etc.\n- Set marks for \"parked\" floss on the pattern\n- Participate in cross-stitch competitions and marathons\n- Save the progress of the pattern marks on the Cloud for safekeeping or later synchronization to other devices\n\nAn interactive cross-stitch pattern is a pattern that you control!"

From theater productions, to mood lighting in a restaurant, to everyday home living, Lightbow has something for everybody! \n\n* Lightbow is an independent 3rd party app, and not affiliated with the companies that make Philips hue, LIFX, WeMo, or Nanoleaf *\n\n** Buy Lightbow for iPhone or iPad, then download on your Apple TV for free (or vice versa).

Activate them all with a single tap.\n- Light animations even run in the background (when you close the app, or hit the sleep button)\n- Share presets with others in your household on your local WiFi network—no emails or passwords necessary!\n- Give each preset a transition, such as crossfade, flashbulb, or fading through a specific color.\n- Randomization ranges offer interesting variations on colors each time you activate a preset.\n- Organize your Presets into Collections for greater flexibility and scalability.\n\nTriggers\n\n- Activate any preset with Siri, countdown timers, alarms, events like opening/closing Lightbow, or even a shake of your phone.\n- For hue tap owners, choose the colors and fade time that each button will trigger on your Philips lights.\n\nGroups \n\n- Put your Philips or LIFX hardware into groups to control sets of lights together.\n- Group lights by room, function, or anything else. Lights can be in multiple groups! \n- Set a color on different models of lighting hardware, and Lightbow will automatically calibrate that color to match up where possible.\n\nLight Control \n\n- From one simple screen, you can rename, reorder, and switch on or off any of your lights. \n- Set the mood of a room with control over the hue, saturation, brightness, and color temperature of each bulb.\n- Use your Belkin WeMo Outlet, LightSwitch, or Insight hardware to turn any electrical device on or off, not just lights!\n- Enjoy your LIFX bulbs using the same familiar interface.

      "label": "Pleasure Machine is a simple erotic game for couples with slot machine interface, and is ideal for heating up your foreplay.\n \nThe erotic slot machine features three rotating reels with displayed parts of the human body, erotic activities and time limits. By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

Our algorithm analyses your voice and compares it with data from over 150 celebrities to let you understand your voice and learn how to improve it.\n\nThe Standard version of the app gives you a full analysis of your voice in terms of depth and variety and calculates a set of celebrity matches to give you a grounding of what your results mean.\n\nThe Pro version helps you improve your voice. Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too. We want to cover things like smoothness, nasality, vocal fry, even creating a rating of how attractive your voice currently is, based on the latest research. If you want to get the most out of your vocal chords, this is the app for you."

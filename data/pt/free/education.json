      "label": "Playing games can be meaningful! At SKIDOS, we know that learning comes naturally to kids through play. That is why we gathered a collection of 40+ unique apps to ensure joyful playtime and engaging learning for 2-11-year-old kids. With SKIDOS apps, kids improve math skills and logical thinking, learn to trace letters and numbers, prompt their curiosity through videos and strengthen 21st-century skills!\n\n40+ APPS WITH SKIDOS PASS\nWith a single Pass, you access all SKIDOS apps where children of different ages will find games to every taste. You can create up to 6 player profiles within one account and log in from multiple devices. Go ahead and customize the app experience for your kids according to their interests and learning level. Stay on top of how your kids learn - check the progress report in the app or via email.\n\nKIDS BATH \nBath is a role-playing game, a toy, and a little helper. It's a fun way to experience bathroom routines and take care of cute, little friends. We took boring things and made them fun to encourage learning through play.\n\nThe app has 7 different scenes:\n- at the sink,\n- in the bath,\n- going to a toilet,\n- taking care of clothes,\n- dressing up,\n- laundry room,\n- playtime\n\nAs parents we get into frustrating situations when kids won't let to brush their hair, clean their nose or cut the nails. BATH is here to help. Play together, talk about activities and learn that there's nothing scary in keeping yourself tidy! :)\n\nSKIDOS LEARNING CURRICULUM\nOur unique approach is to engage kids in learning while they play games they love. We gathered a collection of 40+ fun games and incorporated interactive learning content into them. 4 million kids around the globe play & learn with SKIDOS!\n\nMATH: Our math exercises cover a comprehensive list of topics including number sense, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, geometry, etc. Tasks evolve as a child progresses. Interactive design and animation support learning - three cute little SKIDOS mascots help and encourage kids when they work on the assignments.\n\nTRACING LETTERS & NUMBERS: You can pick tracing letters and numbers for your child to practice. A ladybug will show a little learner how to trace with their finger while visuals and a voice-over will teach new words and counting.\n\nEDUCATIONAL VIDEOS: Video content prompts children's curiosity in a fun and easy way. We created the right mix of entertainment & learning with our video catalog.\n\nSAFE & AD-FREE\nSKIDOS apps do not show ads to kids, are COPPA & GDPR compliant, and ensure a safe online learning environment for kids.\n\nGet your SKIDOS Pass today!\n- SKIDOS offers monthly, quarterly, annual auto-renewable subscriptions\n- 3 Day Free Trial!

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

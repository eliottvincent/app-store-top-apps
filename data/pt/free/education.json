You can even define your own experiments on phyphox.org and share them with colleagues, students and friends.\n\nSelected Features:\n- A selection of pre-defined experiments. Just press play to start.\n- Export your data to a range of widely used formats\n- Remote-control your experiment through a web interface from any PC on the same network as your phone. No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

      "label": "The MILAGE Learning+ is an application for mobile devices that has been developed at the University of Algarve within the ERAMUS + project with partners from Portugal, Spain, Norway and Turkey, enabling students to access educational content in and outside the classroom.\n\nThis app works as a support tool for students which provides them with the opportunity to autonomously solve given exercises compiled in worksheets, while also supporting the teacher in managing classroom time, to the extent that the teacher does not have to provide solutions to exercises in the classroom which are already integrated into the MILAGE Learning+ app.\n\nIn order to stimulate and support the implementation of the various activities proposed, the MILAGE+ Learning app interface incorporates gamification features, segmenting different levels of exercise difficulty to support students with greater difficulties and also motivate more advanced students in learning mathematics. \n\nTo include all students, the app provides detailed videos with the resolution of exercises for students with more difficulties. There is also a concise video with the essential steps to guide you through the resolution of the exercise.\n\nIn addition, the MILAGE Learning+ app also includes a self-assessment scheme and peer review to stimulate the student to work independently. The review of the content and the ability to identify key steps in solving exercises allows for the better storage of knowledge in the long-term memory.\n\nThe MILAGE Learn+ app is free and is available for Apple iOS. \n\nWithin the project, another application was also created - the MILAGE Learning+ Teachers - which is a back office, free for teachers and schools, who wish to join the development of content in mathematics teaching, as well as other subjects that can be included in the MILAGE Learning+ app."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Learn French with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the French language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core French words, form sentences, learn to speak French phrases and take part in conversations. Fun French lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method.

You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of French grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner.

Learn the right French pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your French words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak French clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning French. Mondly teaches you French vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational French. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core French vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak French clearly.\n\n• Advanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family.

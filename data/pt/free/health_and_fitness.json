Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "Need to build your Skin Care routine? Dreaming of a young, healthy and good-looking face skin? Can’t afford regular visits to cosmetologists, or simply don't have enough time for that? Then let ‘forYou’ take care of your face.\n\nGood-looking skin is not simply a matter of DNA! Regular facial fitness and massage are essential if you want your skin to look good at any age.\n\nTo begin with, an Augmented Reality (AR) tool investigates your skin type and wrinkles to suggest the best skin care programme and unique skincare routine. Regular cycle of facial massage takes about 15 min, depending on the programme. We offer simple and effective facial massage exercises that you can do at home using your own hands. The result is youthful, toned skin that will shine and impress yourself and people around you. Our face massage programmes are suitable for people of all ages.\n\nYour daily habits have a big impact on what you see in the mirror. With our face massage & fitness app you can master facial massage exercises that stimulate deep layers of the skin. Same as facial yoga, face building is one of the best ways to improve your skin texture. Face fitness routine will allow you to get rid of swelling, tighten your skin, lift cheeks and build a perfect face oval — exactly the one you dreamed of for many years. forYou skincare routine programmes were developed by professional cosmetologists and should be practiced regularly to achieve the desired results. It is suggested to practice face fitness exercises 10-20 min daily over at least 3 weeks to notice positive results. \n\nFace building can save you money on plastic surgeries: no more expensive cosmetic procedures such as lymphatic drainage and lifting, no more electric massagers. Forget about painful injections, just practice face fitness with forYou following our simple face-lifting techniques.\n\nNo matter how old you are, a man or a woman, just launch forYou and start working on your facial skin routine. Using the latest technologies, you can achieve better results in no time. We make this journey completely safe and pleasant by working with the best specialists in cosmetology and dermatology. \n\nForYou will help you learn facial massage skills even if you are a complete beginner. Visual instructions will walk you through the process. AR will track your day by day progress and make sure you reach positive results. Our app will make your face fitness routine joyful and pleasurable. No matter how stressful the conditions might be, at home or while on the move. Our face fitness programmes are regularly updated by professional cosmetologists to help your skin look healthy and shiny."

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal. Or, see the full picture in browse, where you can find all of your health and wellness data.\n\nLearn more about Google Fit and see a list of supported apps at: https://www.google.com/fit"

Tudo por conta própria.\n\nA abordagem inovadora de terapia guiada do Cíngulo é resultado de mais de 15 anos de pesquisa científica e conhecimento clínico sobre a mente humana, aproveitando as melhores abordagens da psicologia moderna e de metodologias de desenvolvimento pessoal.\n\nEleito o melhor aplicativo do mês pela Revista Exame!\n\nAvaliado com nota 10 pelo TechTudo: “O Cíngulo é uma plataforma extremamente bem feita. Isso deve-se em grande parte às mentes por trás do app: Diogo Lara e Gustavo Ottoni, ambos psiquiatras e PhDs em neurociências. O conhecimento prático no tema faz com que o serviço fuja da regra seguida pela maior parte dos aplicativos do gênero, que apenas reúnem frases motivacionais e autoajuda vazia.”\n\nO Cíngulo tem sido reconhecido como o app mais inovador e acessível para ajudar no desenvolvimento pessoal e no bem-estar emocional.\n\nMilhares de usuários relatam transformações rápidas e profundas em suas vidas, com uma melhora geral da saúde mental.\n\nO Cíngulo pode ser usado por conta própria na privacidade da sua casa ou como complementar à psicoterapia com psicólogo e autodesenvolvimento com coach.\n\nNo Cíngulo você encontra:\n\n• Testes de perfil emocional: testes periódicos e cientificamente validados para você acompanhar seu estado emocional e ver a sua evolução.\n\n• Sessões diárias de autoconhecimento: conteúdos para você cuidar da ansiedade, estresse, autoestima, insegurança, depressão, foco, atitude, relacionamentos, e muito mais. Conte também com sessões guiadas de meditação.\n\n• SOS: técnicas eficazes para resolver rapidamente crises emocionais agudas, com práticas que também ajudam com problemas de insônia para dormir com um sono de qualidade.\n\n• Diário emocional: um espaço para você anotar seus bons e maus momentos, e refletir sobre o que aprendeu no dia.\n\nBaixando o aplicativo, você ganha sessões gratuitas e sempre poderá fazer diversas técnicas SOS e usar o diário emocional a qualquer momento.\n\nQuando quiser liberar todo o conteúdo, você pode assinar o plano anual por R$ 299,90. Os primeiros 7 dias da sua terapia guiada são gratuitos.\n\nO preço acima está em reais e pode variar conforme a localidade.\n\nA assinatura no valor de R$ 299,90 é renovada automaticamente nas 24 horas que antecedem o fim do período do plano vigente, identificando o custo da renovação. Esse valor será cobrado no seu cartão de crédito através da sua conta do iTunes no momento da confirmação da renovação da assinatura. Não será feita a restituição do pagamento para qualquer parte não utilizada do plano. Qualquer porção não utilizada de um período de teste gratuito, se oferecido, será perdida quando uma assinatura for comprada.

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

One human out of 2 has a sedentary lifestyle, which is a real health problem. \n\nMany people find it difficult to motivate themselves and stay in shape. So we try a funny and modern approach: The Reward! Rewarding people with money when they motivate themselves by walking. \n\nWith Macadam you can either walk or run!

For even more accuracy, you can use any connected watch or bracelet compatible with Apple Health (Apple Watch, Withings, Honor, Suunto, Fossil, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n\n- Can I use it for running? \n\nOf course you can! Macadam works perfectly with running. \n\n- Are you affiliated with any other apps that pay for walking (walk to earn)? \n\nMacadam is an independent walk to earn app and is not affiliated with Sweatcoin, StepN, Walk and Earn, million Steps, Fancy Gifts, Nike+ Running, Strava, Charity Miles, Runkeeper, Endomondo, Calo, Fitmint, Movn, Wirtual, Istep, Aglet, Moofit, Movez\n\n\nGrab your legs, your feet, put on your shoes, your sneakers, go for a run or a walk and start earning money with Macadam step counter. \n\nYou walk ?

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level.

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

It came in the right time into my life. After reading a serious of books on topics of psychology, NLP, self-help and using many meditation and life-changing apps, this one stands among my favourites. It feels very personal, non judgemental. It’s easy and intuitive to use, but not childish and it combines great mindfulness, meditation techniques, as well as psychological challenges.\""

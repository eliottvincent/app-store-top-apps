Then use the tap tempo button to select a tempo.\n- Master your rhythm with the Tempo Trainer\n- Option to keep the metronome playing when you exit allowing you to use it with other apps\n- Set a timer to stop the metronome after a certain number of bars\n- Displays Italian tempo markings – handy if you’re not sure how fast Vivace should be.\n- Choose whether to accent the first beat of the bar.\n- Visual beat indication - mute the sound and use the visualisations to follow the beat.\n- Change the pitch of the sound to make the metronome easier to hear over your instrument.\n- Save your settings as Presets\n- Create songs with different tempo settings\n- Organise your favourite songs in to setlists and play through these in “Live” mode\n- Advanced rhythms including Polyrhythms and Swing\n- Integrated Drum Machine\n\nADJUST THE TEMPO WITH ONE TOUCH\nDesigned with ease of use in mind, Metronome Beats has controls for easily increasing and decreasing the tempo in small increments by one touch of the screen. The visual beat indicators help you to keep track of where you are in the bar and enable you to mute the metronome whilst still monitoring the tempo visually. You can also create your own custom sound settings or simply change the pitch to make Metronome Beats easier to hear over your instrument.\n\nRHYTHM AND TEMPO TRAINING\nMetronome Beats has a tempo trainer to help you master your rhythm. Set the metronome to speed up over time or mute every few bars to test your playing.\n\nOnly need a few bars lead in? Use the timer function to stop Metronome Beats when you want. You can also use Metronome Beats at the same time as other apps, allowing you to read sheet music off your Tablet whilst playing the metronome to check your tempo.\n\nADVANCED RHYTHMS AND INTEGRATED DRUM MACHINE\nThe advanced rhythms section allows you to program in more complex rhythms including polyrhythms and swing. There is also an integrated drum machine. Use this to generate a backing track to practice against, or simply have fun generating different rhythms.\n\nSAVE YOUR SETTINGS AND CREATE SETLISTS AND SONGS\nIn the pro version of Metronome Beats you can save your Settings as Presets to access later. You can use these to create song of varying tempos or generate setlists of songs and play through these one by one – useful for solo and group practice as well as playing live on stage.\n\nCONTACT US\nIf you need any help or have any questions about Metronome Beats you can always contact us at support@stonekick.com."

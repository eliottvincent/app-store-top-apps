The Bose Music app makes it easy to set your favorite playlists or stations as presets. Then you can access them effortlessly on your app, the buttons on your speaker, or soundbar remote.\n \nTOTAL CONTROL\nPlay the same music throughout your home or listen to different music in different areas—it’s up to you. The Bose Music app lets you control one or multiple Bose smart products from any room.\n \nGET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR HEADPHONES\nPersonalize your environment with controllable noise cancellation on our Headphones 700, QuietComfort 45 Headphones, QuietComfort Earbuds, and QuietComfort Earbuds II. With Modes on QuietComfort 45 Headphones, QuietComfort Earbuds, and QuietComfort Earbuds II, you decide how much of the world to let in. Choose Quiet Mode for full noise cancelling, or Aware Mode to hear your surroundings and your music at the same time. QuietComfort Earbuds and QuietComfort Earbuds II feature Aware Mode with ActiveSense™ technology, which brings the sounds around you down to a more comfortable level. The result is hearing everything you need to, but at a much more pleasant and balanced volume.\n \nACCESS YOUR FAVORITE VOICE ASSISTANT\nOn our Headphones 700, get quick and easy access to Amazon Alexa, the Google Assistant or your phone’s native assistant, like Siri.\n \nThe availability and features of music and voice services may vary.

A massive library of different tunings for guitar, bass, balalaika, violin, ukulele and more makes it easy to find more qualities and characteristics from your instrument. \n\nThe interface:\nTo make it more intuitive, we give you information about the current pitch in many different ways:\n\n*Cents for the current pitch\n*A red/green light indicating the closest pitch\n*A note wheel corresponding to the chromatic scale\n*A fretboard with the current tuning setting displayed\n\nStandard guitar is set as default but the guitar tuner can be used to tune many different instruments, such as: \n*Guitars - Standard, 4-string, 5-string, 7-string, 8-string\n, 9-string, 10-string, 11-string, 12-string, and 13-string guitar\n*Bass guitars - Standard, 5-string bass and 6-string bass\n*Ukuleles - std (Soprano), Pocket, Concert, Tenor, Baritone, Bass, and Contrabass\n*Banjo - 4-string, 5-string, 6-string\n*Mandolin family - Mandolin (Soprano), Piccolo, Mandola (alto), Octave Mandolin (tenor), Mandocello (Baritone), Mandobass, Irish Bouzouki, Cittern, and Greek Bouzouki\n*Violin family - Violin, Viola, Cello (violoncello), Double bass and 5-string Double bass\n*Balalaika family - Prima, Piccolo, Secunda, Alto, Tenor, Bass and Contrabass\n\nAfter you have selected an instrument you choose a specific tuning.

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit.

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield.

Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One!

This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "Scenic is the number one Motorcycle Navigation App. It’s a genuine alternative to expensive motorcycle GPS units like the Garmin Zumo and TomTom Rider.\n\nWith Scenic, you can plan, navigate, track, share and organize your motorcycle adventures. With its offline maps, unrivaled on-device route planner, vast database of beautiful routes, and curvy routing modes, it’s the complete all-in-one solution. \n\nPreparing your trips, navigating your routes, and recording your adventures has never been easier, all from the palm of your hand.\n\nPLAN\nPlan routes by dropping via points and stops. Scenic will show you a route between them. Don't like it? Choose another routing mode, including curvy!\n\nDISCOVER \nScenic has a vast database of thousands of beautiful routes, shared and rated by local Scenic users worldwide. Select an area, tap 'Search' and see what comes up.\n\nEXPLORE\nYet another way to get a great route... set the distance, then let Scenic generate a round trip for you in any given direction. Or a curvy route to a destination of your choosing.\n\nIMPORT \nFound a great route online? Have some laying around in Basecamp? Whether it’s a Google Maps URL or a GPX, KML, KMZ, GDB or ITN file, import it into Scenic to keep all your routes in one app that’s built for adventure.\n\nRIDE\nOn-screen instructions, voice guidance and customisable detour behaviour mean you can forget about the map and focus on the ride. When you do need to tap in, Scenic is designed to work seamlessly with your touch-enabled gloves.\n\nGO OFFLINE \nNo data/reception? No problem. Scenic’s offline maps mean you can go where others turn back.\n\nTRACK\nScenic not only navigates you, it also logs your location, speed and elevation, so you can relive every moment.\n\nSHARE\nLeave pictures and comments for other riders in the app, get a personalised web page of all your routes and rides, or share your journey straight to social media. \n\nLEARN\nHow much have I been riding on my old Yamaha? Have I been riding less this year? What was my overall average speed this week? How many rides have I done this month? Scenic will tell you.\n\nCONNECT\nScenic is the easiest way to ride to destinations unknown. So why not meet some like-minded riders along the way? Connect with thousands of other Scenic app users and buddy up for group trips.\n\n\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n* Scenic has an optional Premium Subscription that gives you access to Premium Features (Voice Guidance, Route Import & Route & Trip export, Round Trip Generation Better Search Results and Elevation Profiles).

A exactidão desses dados não está portanto sobre o nosso controlo pelo que não nos responsabilizamos por qualquer informação desactualizada e imprecisa sobre os preços praticados.\n \nFuncionalidades:\n \n- Pesquisa por preço e proximidade;\n- Pesquisa por localidade;\n- Pesquisa em mapa;\n- Postos favoritos com filtros de ordenação e assinalados nas listagens\n- Modo inteligente: contabiliza distância, consumo e abastecimento, para custo “real”\n- Introdução de descontos por posto\n- “Bolsa” de preços com tendências, tops e variações nos preços a nível nacional ou local\n- Selecção por tipo de combustível (Gasolina 95, Gasolina 95 Simples, Gasolina 98, Gasóleo, Gasóleo Simples e GPL);\n- Selecção por marca;\n- Selecção por raio de acção (até 30 Km);\n- Ordenação por preço, distância e modo inteligente;\n- Informação detalhada sobre os postos: preços praticados e serviços;\n- Cálculo de rota até aos postos;"

Our unique algorithms determine your elevation using three sources - the GPS system in your phone, network services and, when available, your device’s barometer. Our algorithm combines data from all three sources to give you the most accurate reading possible.\r\n\r\nOur app comes with a brand new independent application for watch devices. You can easily track your hiking trails without using your phone and synchronize data afterwards to enjoy viewing your routes on a bigger screen!\r\n\r\nEven more, you’re able to download a portion of a map to use even if you’re offline!\r\n\r\nKnow your exact heading on your current route, view your current position on the map and use the app to track any route you choose. The app tracks and follows your route in real time, displays it, and then draws elevation and speed charts during your trip. Kick back in your favorite chair after a long trip and view all of the adventures you’ve been on, as our app automatically saves all of them in our database.\r\n\r\nOur highly expanded history screen allows you to see all your data in one place, which includes map data with your route drawn over, trip data with elevation changes, pace, AVG. speed and more, four different charts with speed and elevation data and photos taken during a trip.\r\n\r\nTap or move your finger on or over any value on the chart to know when and where a particular value occurred. You can also choose from multiple functions such as speedometer, calorie counter, checkpoint times, notification sounds at preset milestones, and even auto pause should you decide to stop somewhere for coffee or to take a photo. If you do stop to take photos, they can easily be added with the data of your current position overlayed right on top! Your photos will have elevation, average speed, and location info right on them!\r\n\r\nOur app will also save all data associated with your account so that, should you choose to switch smartphones, nothing will be lost. Simply log in with the new device and pick up where you left off.\r\n\r\nOne of the coolest features of the app is that it divides your route into segments. In the segments screen, you can see separate uphill/downhill data, you can easily check how long it took you to climb a mountain, your recent pace and elevation gain or how fast you descended  later on. You can go into the details of the segment on the map, where you can see a full chart with  all data displayed on a list.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see your route in Maps or another application you can easily export track data to following formats:\r\n- GPX\r\n- KML\r\n- KMZ\r\n\r\nThis app integrates with the Health app, we use it to display your heart rate and store workout data on your device.\r\n\r\nTerms and conditions: https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/altimeter.html\r\nPrivacy policy: https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/altimeter.html"

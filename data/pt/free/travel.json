Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others.

Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

Save hundreds of dollars compared to other travel sites.\n\nDiscover extraordinary travel deals, set fare alerts, and uncover great hotel rates.\n\nWe’re so good, United Airlines actually sued us for it!\n\n• Find flights other search engines won’t show you -- including HIDDEN-CITY flights and arbitrary round-trips\n• Filter flights by duration, number of layovers, takeoff/landing time and more\n• Our powerful search engine pulls in the best deals to save you from having to google flights and check multiple sites\n• Monitor prices for trips you have in the hopper and let us alert you when the best deal is available\n• Book hotels as well, including last-minute hotels and special deals\n• Filter hotels, read reviews and view traveler ratings\n• We now offer car rental as well, so you can use one app as your complete trip planner\n• Our new Stories feature lets you book activities for your vacation - take a brewery tour, rent a kayak, or buy tickets in advance and get your guide to museums and exhibits\n\nThe fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

      "label": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\n\nTaxify your life with the Yango taxi app. It puts the whole city in your hands and lets you ride wherever you want to go via taxi. Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango. These scooters are bright yellow (not lime green), so you can't miss them! Easily order a scooter, find locations on the map (they look like a dot), and build routes with the same high-quality scooters you know and love, all in one convenient, top-tier app. We offer free unlocks and 20 NIS discounts on the first 3 rides to everyone who loves the feel of the wind in their hair. Just log into Yango, select scooters, and enjoy your three free unlocks!\n\nMeet Delivery in Israel - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier all around the Gush Dan district. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car.\n\nEnjoy your ride!\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the Yango taxi app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at yango.com/en_gh/support/\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties. \nUp to 50% (max 6 GHC/5 GHC) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Accra/Kumasi until 31.12.2022.\nThe 30% (max 10 EUR) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Helsinki until 31.12.2022. The 30% (max 100 kr) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Oslo until 31.12.2022.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions"

After your trip, share a travel guide to inspire other travelers.\n\n- See flights, hotels, and attractions in one place (like TripIt and Tripcase)\n- View plans on a travel map & map your route (like Roadtrippers)\n- Rearrange the order of places easily by drag-and-drop\n- Planning a road trip? Add unlimited stops for free, optimize your route, view times & distances between places, and export places to Google Maps\n- Planning group travel? Invite friends and collaborate in real-time just (like Google Docs)\n- Automatically import reservations by forwarding emails or connecting your Gmail\n- Add things to do from top guides with 1 click (like Tripadvisor and Google Trips/Google Travel)\n- Access your trip plans offline\n- Add notes and links to your stops\n- Have your trip plans automatically sync across devices\n- Set budget, track expenses, and split bills with a group\n\n-------\n\nSEE IT ON A MAP\n\nEvery time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.\n\nSTORE PLANS OFFLINE\n\nAll your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.\n\nGET ON THE ROAD\n\nLooking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.\n\nCOLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS\n\nFor group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.\n\nSTAY ORGANIZED\n\nAccess flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.\n\nGET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION\n\nFor each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.\n\nCONTROL YOUR SPENDING\n\nSet a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates."

Want to have quicker access to your ticket during ticket inspection? Want to be able to find your way better at the station and have reliable map information? We have good news for you! SBB Mobile can do it all. And much more. \n \nThe heart of the app is the new navigation bar with the following menu points and content.  \n\nPlan  \n• Plan your journey with a simple timetable search via the touch timetable or use your current position as the origin or destination, locating it on the map.  \n• Buy your ticket for the whole of Switzerland in just two clicks. Your travelcards on the SwissPass are applied. \n• Travel particularly affordably with supersaver tickets or Saver Day Passes. \n\nTrips \n• Save your trip and we will provide you with all the information you need during your journey under ‘Single Trips’: everything from departure and arrival times, platform information and service disruptions to train formations and walking routes.  \n• Set up your personal commuter route under ‘Commuting’ and receive push notifications about rail service disruptions. \n• The app accompanies you from door to door as you travel and you will receive information about delays, disruption and interchange times via push notification.  \n\nEasyRide \n• Check in, hop on and head off – across the entire GA Travelcard network. \n• EasyRide calculates the right ticket for your journey on the basis of the routes you travelled and charges you the relevant amount subsequently. \n \nTickets & Travelcards  \n• Show your public transport travelcards digitally with SwissPass Mobile. \n• It also gives you an overview of your valid and expired tickets and travelcards on the SwissPass. \n\nShop & Services  \n• Buy regional transport tickets and Day Passes for the GA Travelcard area of validity quickly and easily without searching the timetable.  \n• In the ‘Services’ section, you can find lots of useful links about travel. \n\nProfile  \n•  Straightforward access to your personal settings and our customer support.  \n\nContact us. \nIf you have any questions, feel free to get in touch: \n \nhttps://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile/contact.html \n \nData security and authorisations. \nWhat permissions does SBB Mobile need and why? \n \nLocation \nFor connections from your current location, the GPS function must be activated so that SBB Mobile can find the nearest stop. This also applies if you want to have the nearest stop displayed in the timetable. \n \nCalendar and e-mail \nYou can save connections in your own calendar and send them by e-mail (to friends, an external calendar). SBB Mobile requires read and write permissions to be able to import your desired connection into the calendar. \n \nAccess to the camera \nSBB Mobile requires access to your camera to take pictures directly in the app for your personalised touch timetable.  \n\nInternet access \nSBB Mobile requires internet access to search the timetable as well as for ticket purchases. \n \nMemory \nTo support offline functions, e.g. station/stop list, connections (history) and purchased tickets, SBB Mobile requires access to your device’s memory (saving app-specific settings)."

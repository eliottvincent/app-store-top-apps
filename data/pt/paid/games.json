      "label": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

Be careful though: leading has never been easy and it will be even more challenging in a similar world. Something mysterious has thrown the whole future humanity in a deep confusion, causing a continuous stream of events as wars, illness, famine.

Every single event might help you reach your final victory, but at the same time it could be the reason of your failure. Who will be your friend, and who will be your enemy? Hard to say in such a complex world filled with betrayals, aliens, bionic beings and ancient myths.

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

Who wouldn’t like to have the Eiffel Tower in their city?\r\n\r\nPackage Inc. is a beautiful game about designing a delivery system for a growing city. Build a connection between different hubs and feed multiple destinations, like factories, police stations, cafes, libraries, boutiques, saloons, hotels, pizzerias, pet shops or schools. \r\n\r\nAs new hubs are active and there is an increase on demand, you can redesign buildings’ position to keep your delivery process as smooth and efficient as possible. Speed and storage capacity are also essential to keep the delivery network running without inconveniences. How long can you keep the orders moving?\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n• Gracefully minimalist and beautiful visual design;\r\n• Learn management stuff in a never-ending fun way;\r\n• Original soundtrack and immersive experience (headphones are a must!);\r\n• Multiple goals to achieve in real-world cities;\r\n• Several upgrades (some hidden) to improve your network;\r\n• Variety of moods: from extremely relaxing to super thrilling;\r\n• Expand from a small town to a big city.\r\n\r\nPackage Inc. has an evocative visual design and shares the same minimalist features of Infinity Games previous titles. The game starts in a very relaxing pace but rapidly turns into a thrilling experience. Every game is unique, because the growth is random in each city. Your success is highly dependent on the quality and speed of your decisions. \r\n\r\nGoals: \r\n• Deliver as many packages as you can;\r\n• Operate for many days;\r\n• Add multiple destinations;\r\n• Speed up delivery times; \r\n• Increase storage capacity.\r\n\r\nInfinity Games aims to provide the best game experience within its titles. We love showcasing new minimalist puzzle games and making people think while relaxing.\r\n\r\nDo you like our work?

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.\n\n*iPhone 5 / iPod Touch 6 / iPad Mini / iPad Air or later recommended."

Take the role of gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd, and come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack reach his retirement with a nice stack of bills, or will he end up broken ... or worse? \n\nManage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage. \n\nChoose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you’ll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg’s crime bosses. Sometimes you’ll find yourself dodging questions in the press room, or even the occasional cross-examination in the witness box. Can you keep this pressure cooker from exploding, at least for long enough to stash away a nice retirement nest egg?\n\n- Your mission is clear: make $500,000 in 180 days before Jack Boyd reaches retirement. How? That’s up to you!\n\n- Decisions, decisions! This Is the Police is all about a dark story and how you react to it. Whatever you decide, your choices will influence the game – and the fate of Jack Boyd.\n\n- The Good, the Bad, and... the Ugly? The Chief of Freeburg's Police Department deals with all kind of people. It is up to you to find the bad guys and decide how to deal with them.\n\n- Carry out your duties. As head of Freeburg PD, Jack deals with all sorts of challenges every day: responding to emergencies, managing his officers, defending the department against City Hall and a corrupt mayor, and much more.\n\n- Solve Investigations and gather evidence against the criminal gangs of Freeburg.\n\n- Deal with the competing powers of the city. Everyone offers you favors, and each one comes at a price.\nRich and fully voiced story: Jack Boyd is portrayed by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem."

      "label": "The concept of the mental focus grid has been in existence for many years - as a tool/exercise used by coaches and sports performance/psychology professionals to assess and improve performance of their athletes.  \n\nThe objective of the concentration grid exercise is to select in sequence each of the numbers (randomly arranged and presented) in the grid.  Performance is timed.  The challenge is to complete the grid as quickly as possible.  The exercise calls for focus and concentration. \n\nThe concentration grid exercise has been a long-time favorite of many baseball/softball coaches and players (typically using printed/paper sheets, a pen and a stopwatch).  \n\nCoaches/sports performance staff and athletes now can do mental skills training work (and save paper) by using the Concentration Grid app on their mobile device.\n\nThe Concentration Grid app is intended to provide competitive challenge and a fun experience that is simple and straightforward ... like the printed paper grid exercise - but more convenient.  \n\nNothing fancy.  Nothing distracting.  Nothing flashy.  Only the grid.  Numbers.  Black. White. Red.  No on-screen timer or visible ticking clock.  \n\nFocus.  Concentration.\n\nWith the Concentration Grid app the level and nature of the challenge can be varied by changing the size of the grid - by selecting the number of rows and columns for the grid.  \n\nGrids can be generated in a variety of sizes - from 3 columns/rows to 14 columns/rows.  (A grid does not have to have the same number of rows and columns.)  More rows/columns, more numbers.  More numbers, more time.\n\nTry a 3x3 grid ... a 3x14 grid ... a 7x7 grid ... a 7x10 grid ... a 10x10 grid .... a 10x14 grid ... a 14x14 grid.   You get the idea.\n\nThe standard is a 10x10 grid - which a focused grid master should be able to complete in under 4 minutes.\n\nOther benchmarks ...\nA 3x3 grid can be completed in about 3 seconds.\nA 5x5 grid might be completed in under 15 seconds.\nA 7x7 grid can be completed by a master in well under a minute.\nA 9x9 grid might be completed in 3 minutes.\nA 14x14 grid will take well over 10 minutes to complete.\n\nTest yourself:  Can you complete a 6x6 grid in under 30 seconds? \n\nSmaller grids will call for dexterity and quick vision as well as focus/concentration.\n\nLarger grids will challenge your ability to sustain focus/concentration ... your mental stamina is put to the test.\n\nChallenge yourself with Concentration Grid.  Track and measure your improvement as you practice.  Then compare your best grid times against the best grid times of teammates and others ... who is the fastest?  Who is a master of the grid?  (Coaches and teachers can set up intrasquad competitions/tournaments to find out.)\n\nPractice makes perfect.   Sustained attention and effort are rewarded with improved performance/times in the grid exercise.\n\nThe grid exercise can be practiced in quiet places/at home or during road trips or during school/practices ... or under loud/distracting (game day) conditions.  Parents/teachers might have their children/students use the exercise regularly to practice and improve concentration ability.  In a world filled with distractions, anyone can use Concentration Grid to practice focus skills. \n\nThe Concentration Grid app will provide your grid time (elapsed time to complete the grid exercise) as well as a GRID_ID data set that includes additional information about your performance.  The app will also maintain a history/file for you to monitor your performance/improvement.  \n\nAnd Concentration Grid includes a SHARE feature which will allow you to share/post your grid times and screenshots on social media or to a leaderboard (community site).\n\nThe Concentration Grid app is perfect for coaches, athletes, students, teachers/educators, sports performance/psychology staff, parents, children, adults - young and old ....\n\nChallenge yourself.  Make self-development a daily habit.  \n\nWebsite - www.concentrationgrid.com\nCommunity - www.concentrationgrid.net"

At the beginning of the game, you get a little money to buy a car, but with each completed task your capital will grow and you will be able to afford cooler cars.\n\nThe game is a simulator, so do not forget to monitor the fuel level and plan a route through the gas stations, otherwise you will run out of fuel, the car will stall and you will be forced to call a tow truck to deliver the car to the gas station. For planning routes, we made a convenient map with navigation, which displays all available and active tasks. You will often have to drive off the road, but are you ready for it, right?\n\nCars differ from each other in power, cross-country ability, fuel consumption and, of course, the capacity of the trunk. Pay attention to the requirements for the vehicle in the mission, so that there is enough space in the trunk of the vehicle in which you will carry out the mission for the entire load.\n\nThe island is divided into zones: snow-capped mountains and icy road, arid deserts and a forest with lakes and singing birds, where you will also have to drive cars through the mud. Quests are closely intertwined with the types of regions, this will add atmosphere to the gameplay. Each driver will appreciate that depending on the location of the game, off-road riding changes and gives a unique feeling. As in our other driving games, the new one has realistic car handling and the suspension looks and works like in real cars.\n\nUpon reaching a certain level, you will have the opportunity to participate in off-road races. Each race will give you a generous reward for tuning cars or buying new ones at the car dealership. First of all, the game is about cars, so the game has a tuning of cars, it is available in a car service, where you can also change the color of the car. And the city also has your personal garage where all the cars you bought are kept.\n\nMany original missions include those in which you'll save a forest from a fire, help kids on a school bus caught in a blizzard, deliver water to arid regions, and transport fish from the port to shops.\n\nExplore the island carefully and you will find hidden treasures that you can use to pay for various services or spend on a special off-road vehicle.\n\nFeatures of the game Driving Zone: Offroad\n• Play without ads\r\n• Get double rewards for completing tasks\n• Open world\n• Customizable driver and car tuning\n• Consumable fuel by cars and petrol stations on the map\n• Unique tasks\n• View from the salon\n• Car dealership for the sale of cars, car service and personal garage\n• Off-road racing in 4x4 cars\n• Free driving possibility\n• Dynamic change of day and night\n• Ability to play offline"

      "label": "\"If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you.\" - , 9/10, Pocket Gamer UK\n\n\"This War of Mine isn’t exactly “fun,” but it’s definitely a game worth playing.\" , 9/10, 148apps\n\n\"I'm really excited to go home and download 11 bit studios' title on my iPad\" , Game Informer\n\nIn This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n\nThis War of Mine: Anniversary Edition\nIt's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? \n\nKey Features:\n• Inspired by real-life events \n• Control your survivors and manage your shelter \n• Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive \n• Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience \n• Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game \n• Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\n\nThis War of Mine experience is now broadened with \"The Little Ones\" expansion. \"The Little Ones\" explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.\n\n• Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine\n• Protect innocent children\n• Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need\n• Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is optimized for latest devices. While playing on older devices such as iPhone 4s or iPad 2 you might experience lower frame rates."

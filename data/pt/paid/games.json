A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

      "label": "This is a simulator to help you learn to fly, or practice flying an FPV race-style quadcopter in FPV.  With that said, you can also fly in LOS and fly a plane instead of a quad!\n\nThe main thing to note about this simulator is that it's not about racing.  Whilst there are some basic gates set up to go through, this is more focused towards freestyle flying, and flying for fun.\n\nTo that end, we've included aspects such as being able to chase other vehicles: You can chase up to 3 cars at once going around various circuits on over the different levels and try chasing a plane to help you find ways you might capture this kind of footage in real life.\n\nIn the levels you'll find mountains to proximity fly, trees to weave through, a partly constructed office block to fly through (but watch out for the nearby moving crane), moving wind turbines, balls to hit, and not to mention a city with densely packed buildings to fly through.\n\nTo give an added sense of realism, weather effects, and time of day are supported - so fly at night, fly in a thunderstorm - whatever you like.\n\nOnline play is also supported with up to 4 players per room where you can mix and match planes and quads and also have full crossplay with other mobile devices and those on the desktop versions.\n\nLastly, there is Quad Ball, a fully-featured game within the sim!  In Quad Ball you have to use your quadcopter to get the ball to the goal... ram the ball in just the right way to reach the goal, but be careful, overcook your hit and the ball might fall out of play.\n\nSupport for touch controls and bluetooth controllers such as the Playstion and Xbox gamepads  Touch controls work well for gentle flying, but for really fast acrobatic flight, using an external controller is highly recommended.\n\nFull setup for your quad (or plane) is provided so you can set things up as gentle or aggressive as you like.  Some pre-defined rates are also supplied if you want to simplify things.\n\nInstructions on how to operate the sim are included within the app, but more verbose documentation can be found here https://www.currykitten.co.uk/currykitten-fpv-sim-mobile-edition/\n\nThis app is still under development, and thus more features and levels are expected in the future.\n\nThe sim should run well on most reasonably up-to-date iPhones to iPads (it was extensively tested using an iPhone XR) but is graphically intensive so older devices may struggle.  It's possible to alter the graphic detail in-game to help with this though."

      "label": "After a lengthy radio silence, Taylor returns at last! This brand new adventure finds the hapless astronaut on the other side of a black hole, relying on you alone to help make life-or-death decisions in a playable, branching story of survival in the depths of unknown space.\n \nBut this time, there’s a twist: Players can also choose to communicate with T2, Taylor’s time-warped, alien-infected “evil twin,” helping or hindering as they see fit. Throughout the story, seemingly simple decisions can have profound effects. Make choices using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, and face the consequences alongside the desperate astronauts.\n \nWriter Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) returns to pen this fourth Taylor adventure -- the seventh overall in the acclaimed, multi-million-selling Green Series. Whether this is your first interaction with Taylor, or you’ve been a diehard fan from the beginning, you’ll discover a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes.\n \nThe original Lifeline took the App Store by storm -- reaching #1 Top Paid Game on iPhone and Apple Watch in 29 countries -- while pioneering a new narrative experience enabled by modern devices. This story plays out in real time as the astronauts work to stay alive, with notifications delivering new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Taylor or T2 directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.\n \nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and discover what happens when you make a different choice. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n \nThe story contains no in-app purchases and no ads. An internet connection is not required. \n \nPraise for the original Lifeline:\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“I felt an immediate attachment to a fictional character pinging me from a strange galaxy to my wearable.” - Luke Hopewell, Gizmodo Australia\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\nLifeline: Beside You in Time was created by:\nDave Justus\nMars Jokela\nColin Liotta\nCrystal Silva\nMatt Burchstead\n\nMusic by Rose Azerty\n\nIn loving memory of William Justus, my lifelong lifeline. Hope you dig this one, dad."

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!\n\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

The fate of Taylor, and the world, is in your hands!\n\nPraise for Lifeline:\n\n“This is the best game on the Apple Watch.” – Time.com\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer"

      "label": "The original Lifeline took the App Store by storm, reaching #1 Top Paid Game on iPhone and Apple Watch in 29 countries. Its compelling mix of real-time storytelling and Dave Justus’s suspenseful writing continues to capture the imaginations of countless players worldwide. \n\nLifeline 2 raises the bar with a new story almost twice as long as the original, with many more choices and paths to explore. Lifeline 2 features a 28-minute original soundtrack and is fully optimized for watchOS 2, delivering the best Lifeline experience on Apple Watch yet.\n\nThe second story in the Lifeline series connects you with Arika, a young woman on a deadly quest to avenge her parents and rescue her long-lost brother. Your choices will keep her alive and help her succeed as she faces mortal danger on her way to a final, fateful showdown against the forces that threaten all of humanity.\n\nLifeline stories play out in real time. As Arika travels to complete her quest, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Arika directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app on your phone.\n\nAfter completing any story branch, you can rewind to earlier parts of the story, or speed through parts you’ve already read. See what happens when you make a different choice: will you guide Arika virtuously, or cut corners to gain an edge? Seemingly simple actions can deeply affect the outcome. \n\nArika’s story, and the fate of the world, depend on your judgment. You will face the consequences together, because Arika is relying on YOU. \n\n\nLifeline 2 features no in-app purchases and no ads. An Internet connection is not required.\n\nWATCH US: http://www.youtube.com/c/LifelineGame\n\nPraise for the original Lifeline:\n\n“[A] surprising iPhone and Apple Watch bestseller is pushing the boundaries of fiction” - boingboing.net\n\n“This is the best game on the Apple Watch” - Time.com\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\n\nLifeline 2 was created by:\nDave Justus\nMatthew Sturges\nColin Liotta\nDan Selleck\nMars Jokela\nBenjamin Ellebracht\n\nOriginal music composed by Norman Fairbanks.

Help the citizens through cataclysms and natural disasters, becoming a better emergency number operator every day!\r\n\r\n112 Operator allows you to manage emergency services in any city in the world! Dispatch units, take calls and face situations caused by weather, traffic or changing seasons. Help the city survive escalating events like riots, organized crime, terrorist attacks, cataclysms, natural disasters and many more!\r\n\r\nDanger has escalated\r\nHelp on a scale bigger than ever before. The sequel of the award-winning 911 Operator lets you act on many, completely different levels - from taking care of a single neighborhood to coordinating several operators’ work in the world’s biggest metropolises.  Choose from over 100 000 areas, such as districts, municipalities, and tens of thousands of real cities from all over the world.\r\n\r\nTo all units: a storm is coming…\r\nFace the dynamic weather, based on authentic, historical data. Watch the incidents change as day or night comes, traffic increases and seasons pass. Watch out for extreme conditions that may lead to cataclysms and natural disasters. Try to tame big wildfires spreading across the map. Weather isn’t your only problem though - be careful when dealing with terrorist attacks and gang wars.\r\n\r\n112, what’s your emergency?\r\nTake calls from people in various situations, needing emergency services’ help. You never know who’s on the other side of the line - you might hear a frightening murder story, maybe you’ll have to instruct someone on performing CPR, or keep your nerves while encountering an annoying prankster.\r\n\r\nIt’s my job, ma’am...\r\nChoose one of the European cities in completely new Career mode and find out if you’ll manage to climb up to the very top of an operator’s career ladder. Follow the commands of your supervisors and see your actions affecting people you’re in charge of or those who need your help. Sometimes your mistakes will only be followed by a reprimanding e-mail, sometimes they’ll influence your own life. You can also play special scenarios in any city in the world, or make your own rules in the Free Game mode.\r\n\r\nWe need backup!\r\nCommand the best specialists, using technologically advanced equipment and vehicles. Decide what to use - a SWAT team, Search and Rescue helicopter, or maybe riot gear? When your units arrive at the scene, command them in the tactical view that gives you the full image of the situation.\r\n\r\nNEW FEATURES IN 112 OPERATOR:\r\n-25 times bigger, expandable maps of REAL CITIES\r\n-entirely new set of emergency calls and large events\r\n-completely redesigned campaign mode, with objectives system, emails, and a story\r\n-day&night, weather, seasons and traffic now influences the duty and the incidents happening\r\n-new fire mechanic, that can consume entire areas and require dozens of units\r\n-region specification - gameplay will vary depending on a country legislation and district characteristics (slums / business / residential /industrial / forest etc)\r\n-new OnSite situation visualization that shows the action precisely and intuitively\r\n-new team members - doctors, sergeants, dogs, robots, and others!\r\n-additional dispatchers, that you can assign to districts for help!\r\n-redesigned equipment, now packed up in entire gears"

      "label": "ABC Dinos is an educational game for preschool kids and elementary school first graders to learn to read and write vowels and consonants. \nIt adapts to each child's age group, allowing them to choose the letter that they want to learn whether in uppercase or lowercase. \nIn addition, ABC Dinos has English voices which allows the youngest children (preschool) to hear the words without needing to know how to read.\n \nDESCRIPTION\nABC Dinos is an educational game for children. With spectacular results, the game makes it possible to learn letters and improve reading and writing, regardless of each child's learning level. \nThe screen interface is attractive and simple allowing children to play alone without needing an adult. \nAll this learning is wrapped in a magical story full of emotions, action and fun surrounded by funny characters such as Finn's family, our Dino, and the \"\"crazy\"\" ogres and their dragons. Help Finn free his family by collecting the magic letters that make ogres transform into funny animals !\n\n\nENGLISH VOICES\nWe have incorporated English voices to repeat the literacy activity words and statements. With this we not only manage to make our activities accessible to all ages, but it also allows us to incorporate auditory recognition activities, which are so valuable at this stage in their learning (Preschool and 1st grade). \n\n\nOBJECTIVES\n    - Learn to read\n    - Visual and auditory memorization\n    - Discrimination of vowels and consonants \n    - Discrimination of the letters of the alphabet\n    - Improvement of understanding\n    - Learn to draw the outline of all the letters of the alphabet (vowels and consonants). \n    - Expand vocabulary with: animals, professions, objects, clothing, nature, etc.  \n\n\nLEARNING GAMES\n\n- WRITE THE LETTER\nIn this educational game the kids have to draw the shape of each letter. As a prize they will receive an image that begins with that letter. They can choose the preferred mode of writing: joined up or printed handwriting. At the same kids will also have the possibility to trace each letter of the alphabet in uppercase or lowercase. \n\n- WORD FORM\nThis activity consists of the formation of level-appropriate words by dragging each letter to its corresponding place. And since we know that this quite difficult, we will help the little ones by changing the shape of each letter as if it were a puzzle piece that fits in. In this way all children, regardless of their age, can progress with word formations and then go on to expand their vocabulary and begin to learn to read. \n\n- WHERE ARE THE LETTERS?\nThis is, without doubt, one of the most fun learning games in our APP. The child has to find the matching letter of the two cards as quickly as possible. This game aims to strengthen visual recognition of vowels and consonants.\n\n- WHICH LETTER DOES BEGIN WITH?\nIn this activity the kids will hear a word and see its picture. They have to guess the letter that the word begins with. The auditory recognition of each letter of the alphabet and the expansion of their vocabulary are the two main objectives of this educational game.\n\n\nADAPTS TO YOUR AGE\nAt the beginning of the game it will ask about the child's level so you don't need to worry if your son or daughter doesn't yet know how to read or write. It adapts to their learning level and you can choose which letters you want to work with and repeat at any point.\n\n\nCompany: Didactoons\nRecommended age: For children aged between 3 and 7 years old (preschool and 1st - 2nd grades of Primary)."

If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\r\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\r\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\r\n\r\nWe will update and improve Real Drift constantly. Please rate and give your feedback for further improvement of the game.\r\nFOLLOW US\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Real-Drift/788082697884714"

Includes improved AI, 3D landscape, new exclusive features.\n\n*** Carcassonne fits that opening game niche that every game group needs. -Tyler Nichols, Board Game Quest\n*** Carcassonne = Great game, great mechanics, great pieces, great fun! -The Board Game Family\n\nA TILE PLACEMENT GAME OF CREATING LANDSCAPES, CLAIMING AREAS, AND GAINING POINTS\nDiscover or re-discover Carcassonne, the multi-awarded tile-based game in which players draw and place their tiles to build a medieval city. Place your cities, roads, abbeys or fields to enlarge your landscape, then place your followers, the meeples. Knights, robbers or farmers... Each meeple will help you control your territory and win points.\nBut be careful, you will need all your best strategy and tactics to maximum your points! Place your tiles and your meeples wisely to stop your opponents and win the game.\n\n6 EXPANSIONS: ENLARGE YOUR LANDSCAPE AND OPTIMIZE YOUR POINTS\nThanks to the mini expansions \"\"The River\"\" and \"\"The Abbot\"\", you can embellish your landscape and vary your game to enjoy new ways to play! Double or even triple your points thanks to the new buildings in the Inns & Cathedrals expansion! And with the Traders & Builders expansion, score more points with the trading commodities and build faster with the builders! Discover the city of Carcassonne covered with a blanket of white snow in the Winter Edition... and look out for the Gingerbread Man and the bonus points he'll give you! Beware of the Dragon in \"\"the Princess and the Dragon\"\" expansion! He could eat your Meeples if you're not cautious. And be kind with the Princess: she might prefer you to other Meeples and toss them out of the cities!\n\nFEATURES\n• Accessible and tactical gameplay adapted from the award-winning Carcassonne board game    \n• 6 expansions:\n- The River, the Inns & Cathedrals, the Traders & Builders, the Winter Edition and Princess & Dragon are all available to purchase from the Game Shop.\n- Unlock The Abbot for free using your Asmodee account.\n• Up to 6 players! Play against the computer in solo mode, face off your friends in Pass and Play or challenge players from around the world in online mode\n• There is no more 3 but 4 different behaviors you can chose before starting a game with AIs. They all propose a better challenge than the previous ones. Players who want to experiment a true challenge will play against the Conqueror AI who is the strongest AI of the game.\n• Try out the aerial top view to refine your strategy!\n• Additional strategic layers compared to the physical version:\n- field view which allows you to see the field possession of each player\n- remaining tile list: allows you to see the tiles which are remaining in the draw pile\n\nLanguages available: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish\n\nYou can follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and You Tube!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/asmodeedigital/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/asmodeedigital\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/asmodeedigital/\nYou Tube: https://www.youtube.com/asmodeedigital"

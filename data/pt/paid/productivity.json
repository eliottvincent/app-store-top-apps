For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time.

To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Using one of the supported OBD adapters you can read trouble codes or display sensor values in realtime, check the current state of the DPF in your car or register a new battery after replacement. BimmerLink even allows you to remotely control the exhaust flap or mute the Active Sound Design in your car.\n\nREAD AND CLEAR TROUBLE CODES\nDiagnose your car as would otherwise be possible only by your Service Partner. In contrast to generic OBD apps that read emission related errors only, BimmerLink allows you to read and clear trouble codes from ALL control units in your car.\n\nDISPLAY REALTIME SENSOR VALUES\nBimmerLink provides a big selection of values like oil temperature or boost pressure. Keep an eye on all the important parameters of your car with a personalized dashboard.\n\nEXHAUST FLAP REMOTE CONTROL*\nTake control over the exhaust flap in your car and decide yourself, whether it should be closed or open.\n\nACTIVE SOUND DESIGN**\nIf you do not like the artificial engine sound generated in your car, just mute the Active Sound Design with BimmerLink.\n\nSOUND TUNING***\nThe “Sound Tuning” option allows you to disable the “exhaust burble“ in cars equipped with the S55 engine (M2 Competition, M3, M4).\n\nDPF REGENERATION****\nBimmerLink allows you to check the current state of the diesel particulate filter in your car. Find out when the last regeneration took place or how much ash has accumulated in the filter and start a regeneration with the touch of a button.\n\nBATTERY REGISTRATION\nIf you want to replace the battery in your car, this has to be registered in the engine control unit and BimmerLink allows you to do this yourself now.\n\nPARKING BRAKE SERVICE MODE\nBimmerLink allows you to activate the service mode for the electromechanical parking brake.\n\nSERVICE RESET\nReset the service display in your car after carrying out maintenance work like a brake pad replacement or an engine oil change.\n\nREQUIRED ACCESSORIES\nTo use the app one of the supported Bluetooth or WiFi OBD adapters or cables is required.

      "label": "Perfect OCR gives you both an accurate general purpose OCR app and a quality document scanner. Now you can scan and OCR your letter-size or A4 documents with an accuracy of 90% or more, edit, copy and store the recognized text, and e-mail your documents as PDF files with text, SINGLE page image, or both together!\n\nNOTE: To ensure the advertised results it is important that you follow the OCR TIPS below (or in the app's help). \n\n\"It worked great for me! I translated a whole story in spanish using the espanol language preference and then I copied and pasted it into a translator to get the whole story in English!\"\n\"This app is really very good and I find it to be very accurate!\"\n>> Perfect OCR users.\n\nPerfect OCR scans your documents using advanced image-processing algorithms to eliminate uneven lighting and shadows and improve contrast. The result is the clearest and most readable scans possible from the iPhone's camera. Perfect OCR also offers SureScan, our proprietary scanning mode that delivers sharper images with less jitter or smear. \n\nOur unique \"Email to myself\" feature lets you send documents to a predefined address, or even upload them to an online storage service like Evernote or Box.net, with a single tap. Uploading documents to online services via email is fast, secure, and can be done even if you're temporarily off line. Refer to app help for details.\n\nAll processing happens on your iPhone, and the confidentiality of your data is never compromised. There is also no subscription fee, and no Internet access is needed to scan documents or run OCR.\n\n\nPERFECT OCR FEATURES:\n• Letter-size or A4 page OCR with accuracy of 95% for model 3GS, 98% for iPhone 4, and up to 90% for 3G\n• OCR languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Czech and Ukrainian.\n• Email multipage PDFs with text, SINGLE page image, or both\n• Automatic document edge detection and perspective correction\n• Multipage text recognition with accuracy indicator\n• Text editing and copy-to-clipboard operations\n• Built-in OCR text archive with file sharing via iTunes\n• \"Email to myself\" feature\n• Email text and image files (.TXT + .JPG), or save image to library\n• Searchable PDFs with document images (single page)\n• Preserves simple text formatting\n• Option to auto-remove line breaks\n• SureScan mode for jitter-free scans\n• Simple yet powerful user interface\n• Instant brightness, rotation, and color controls\n• Compact attachments with adjustable size\n\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS FOR OCR:\n• Make sure your document is flat and well lit. Hold your iPhone still while shooting. \n• Always scan documents using \"SureScan 3x\" mode.\n• Glossy paper may not work well (avoid glare).\n• When scanning books keep the pages as flat as possible and your iPhone parallel to the surface.\n• Perfect OCR cannot recognize handwritten, very large text or spreadsheets correctly.\n• Make sure to select the right language for OCR in app settings.\n\n\nWe're constantly improving Perfect OCR, and we value our customers' opinions and feedback. Please contact us at support@turboscanapp.com. If you have a problem with our software, please contact us before submitting a comment to the app store. We can solve most of the problems, but we cannot respond to comments."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

Within the hour, you’ll have everything off your mind and neatly organized—from routine tasks to your biggest life goals—and you can start focusing on what matters today.\n\n“Things offers the best combination of design and functionality of any app we tested, with nearly all the features of other power user applications and a delightful interface that never gets in the way of your work.”\n—Wirecutter, The New York Times\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• Your To-Dos\nYour basic building block is the almighty To-Do—each a small step toward a great accomplishment. You can add notes, tag it, schedule it, and break it down into smaller steps.\n\n• Your Projects\nCreate a Project for any big goal, then add the to-dos to reach it. Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)\n\n\nMORE THINGS TO LOVE\n\nAs you dive deeper, you’ll find Things packed with helpful features. Here are just a few:\n\n• Reminders — set a time and Things will remind you.\n• Repeaters — automatically repeat to-dos on a schedule you set.\n• This Evening — a special place for your evening plans.\n• Calendar integration — see your events and to-dos together.\n• Tags — categorize your to-dos and quickly filter lists.\n• Quick Find — instantly find to-dos or switch between lists.\n• Magic Plus — drag the + button to insert to-dos anywhere in a list.\n• Share extension — create to-dos with content from other apps.\n• Widgets — see your lists on the home screen.\n• Mail to Things — forward an email to Things; now it’s a to-do.\n• And much more!\n\n\nMADE FOR IPHONE\n\nThings is tailored to the iPhone with deep system integrations as well. A great example is the Share extension, which allows you to create to-dos with content from other apps, such as a link to a website you want to get back to.\n\nYou can also enjoy a beautiful dark mode at sunset, connect your calendars, add widgets to your home screen, create to-dos via Siri, import from Reminders—Things can do it all! There’s even Shortcuts integration if you want to automate your workflows.\n\n\nMADE FOR APPLE WATCH\n\nThings comes with a great app for Apple Watch. Just raise your wrist to glance at your Today list, mark to-dos complete as you go, and dictate new ones on the fly—all synced instantly with your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\n\nAWARD-WINNING DESIGN\n\nMade in Stuttgart, with two Apple Design Awards to its name, Things is a fine example of German engineering: designed not only to look fantastic, but to be perfectly functional as well. Every detail is thoughtfully considered, then polished to perfection.\n\n“It’s like the unicorn of productivity tools: deep enough for serious work, surprisingly easy to use, and gorgeous enough to enjoy staring at.”\n—Apple\n\n\nGET THINGS TODAY\n\nWhatever it is you want to accomplish in life, Things can help you get there.

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

Everything is tracked, include all the advanced properties you can see in Outlook. Best of all TaskTask includes flagged items (email!) so you can see your complete task list on the go.\n\nUsing TaskTask, you can manage your to-do list, create tasks, set start/due dates, mark complete, assigning categories, change importance, set and receive reminders, and delete tasks.

TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

This means that this app's proprietary printing engine only works within this app. To say it another way: the iOS does not support/allow third party system-wide drivers. The iOS cannot use this app to print files within another app's storage space—for example, files stored in Pages, Numbers, Safari, Notes, Mail, etc. Therefore, files created in other apps must be imported into this app.\n\n\nHOW DO I IMPORT FILES INTO THIS APP?\n    • Use a web browser to transfer files between your computer and this app.\n    • Use iTunes to upload files into this app.\n    • Use a WebDAV server to transfer files.\n    • Email a file to yourself.

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "miCal is THE calendar that you’ve always wished your iPhone or iPad had! miCal makes scheduling easier, clearer—and better looking—than ever before.\n\nQuick Overview\nThe dashboard displays your current appointments and events, tasks and birthdays. You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

      "label": "iCircuit is the premier iPad and iPhone app for designing and experimenting with circuits and Arduinos. Its advanced simulation engine can handle both analog and digital circuits and features realtime always-on analysis. It is the perfect companion to students, hobbyists, and engineers.\n\nYou use it as you would any CAD program: you add elements, connect them together, and set their properties.\n\nBut iCircuit is unlike other CAD programs because it is always simulating. It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!\n\nThere are over 70 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from a programmable Arduino, to simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETS, to digital gates.\n\nThe app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals. The scope can also display the Fourier transform of any signal so that you can see the performance of filters.\n\nSupported elements include:\n\n• Programmable Arduino using a subset of the C programming language\n• Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources\n• Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors\n• Manual SPST/SPDT and DPST/DPDT Switches, Push buttons, and Relays\n• LEDs, Diodes, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs\n• Audio simulation with Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs\n• ADCs, and DACs\n• Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR\n• JK and D Flip-flops\n• 38 7400 series digital parts \n• 78xx and LM317 voltage regulators\n• 7-segment display and driver\n• Antenna with simulated AM and FM signals\n\nYou can also create sub circuits to introduce new elements and componentize your designs.\n\nNo matter your skill set, you'll be playing with circuits in no time with iCircuit."

      "label": "LockBox Pro lets you store and protect sensitive info such as credit card numbers, bank accounts, passwords, pin numbers, private notes, and any other secret information on your iPhone or iPod Touch.\n\nNow supports ios11\n\nNEW Version v1.2 fixes a bug that sometimes causes imports to fail or only import partial data. Thanks to everyone who reported this and helped us fix it!!\n\nNEW Version 1.1 allows you to:\n\n- NEW! Import Bulk Data from your computer into LockBox Pro.  Saves lots of typing on your device!\n\n- NEW! Export/Backup data to your computer over a WiFi connection! Remember to do this regularly!\n\n- NO Ads!\n\nUse it to keep information handy and also protected at the same time.\n\nNew Pro Edition Features:\n(not found in the free version)\n\n* Import Data - create a file on your computer and import it into LockBox Pro via Wifi.  Saves you lots of typing on the device.\n\n* Stronger Security - data is secured via Apple's Keychain which utilizes 3DES encryption for high security.\n\n* More Flexible - you can add as many fields as you like to each entry. (the free version is fixed at 2 fields per entry)\n\n* No Ads\n\nIMPORTANT:\nExisting free version users... you can now upgrade easily while keeping your data!  Just export your data first using the free version and then import it into LockBox Pro via the WiFi import feature.\n\nNew Features:\n\n* import/export via WiFi \n* Sound effects can now be turned off! :-)\n* The app exits correctly when you lock your iPhone with the top button.\n* You can now easily rearrange and delete items in your list. (and they stay rearranged)\n* Your data is backed up via the regular iTunes backup, but be sure to use the new export feature as data is sometimes saved incorrectly in iTunes. iTunes also does not allow you to change devices... your data will be lost if you don't back it up using the new WiFi export method.\n\n(all bug fixes are available in the free version as well... however the new advanced features are not)\n\nMore Info:\n\nAll data is encrypted and protected by your secret code, so only you have access to it, even if you let your friends borrow your phone to make a call or browse online.\n\nThis is the kind of information that you want easy access to while you are on the go, but find it hard to recall just when you need it.  For example, I always forget my bank account number right when I need to deposit a check at the bank.\n\nNot sure if you need this?\n\nTry the FREE version first... it's called LockBox (not Pro) :-)\n\nGo Pro for a low price for a limited time!  \n\nIMPORTANT BACKUP INFORMATION: \n\nRemember to sync and do a backup of your data through the LockBox app before updating to newer versions!  You never know what might happen to your phone in the middle of a sync :-)  Also, the iTunes backup is not enough in some cases especially when you have to replace your phone or reset it, so make sure you use the WiFi backup method to protect your data.  Its the only way to make sure your data is safe when doing a sync or restore for your device."

GPS needs satellite’s visibility. Thus, the more open your space, the better the accuracy of measurements.\n\n* Geographic coordinates collection formats:\n    . Points - Mark specific places with a point, such as the place you most like to go to, or the starting point of a race, or even the point where you saw a rare bird;\n    . Lines or paths - A sequence of points forming a line to mark a trail where you have walked, or the path you have taken on a run, or the path to your new house, either the location of a new fence you want to build. All mapped lines are measured for you in metric and imperial units;\n    . Areas or polygons - A sequence of points, forming a closed region, to mark land that you are interested in buying, or show the map of your land, or measure the outline of your new house, or delimit the region where you want to build a pool. All mapped areas are calculated for you in metric, imperial and Thai units;\n\n* How to collect coordinates:\n    . Manually: You position yourself and tap the MapIt button to collect a coordinate;\n    . Automatically by Time: A coordinate is collected at each defined time interval;\n    . Automatically by Distance: A coordinate is collected at each interval of a pre-defined distance;\n    . Automatically by Direction: A coordinate is collected each time you change the direction of your displacement at an angle greater than a defined limit;\n\n* Presentation within iMapIt:\nPoints, lines and polygons can be represented by different types of pins, colors, strokes and fills.\n\n* Export your surveys:\n    . In these formats: DXF, KML, GPX or CSV;\n    . Using these projections: UTM or Gauss Krüger, or directly the collected geographical coordinates;\n    . Sending via: eMail, or directly from your device via iTunes (cable), or even more professionally, transferring to a Web server previously prepared to receive them;\n\n* Editing functions of surveys performed:\n    . Feature duplication;\n    . Union of existing features;\n    . Division of a feature in two;\n    . Deletion of unwanted coordinates;\n    . Automatic cleaning of unnecessary points;\n    . Move a feature to a new project;\n\nDisclaimer on the accuracy of the surveys:\nAll points, paths or areas are surveyed using the GPS accuracy of your device. This is not a professional precision GPS equipment. So your surveys may vary when compared to the actual dimensions."

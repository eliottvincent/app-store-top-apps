During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

You can create an app in minutes and enhance it to create rich custom apps for your team, business, or enterprise. Check review sites like Capterra to learn how AppSheet’s modern technology platform outpaces older low-code solutions like PowerApps, Salesforce1, and App Maker. \n\nAppSheet is an ideal solution for many business, including those in property management, agriculture, supply chain, operations, salesforce management, education and more. Here are just a few scenarios:\n\nWORKING WITH REMOTE TEAMS\nApps built with AppSheet can help a remote team work with centralized data saved in spreadsheets (eg: in Google Drive, Box, or Droppox) or SQL databases. \n\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nMillions of people manage projects using Google Sheets, Excel, and Smartsheets. Project managers can build apps with AppSheet to display and share project data through a mobile device with other team members and stakeholders. Keep data centralized in a core spreadsheet and share only the parts that their audience needs to see. No more managing dozens of files that go back and forth via email!\n\nEDUCATION\nManage study plans, school rosters, grading, and group work by creating a custom app with charts, maps, text summaries and image galleries. Share the app securely with students and colleagues.\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT:\nKeep track of your customer pipeline on a Google Sheet but get the benefits of a streamlined custom mobile app using AppSheet. You can also interact with your data in new ways like building maps from your data, calling or messaging to telephone numbers, sending emails to contacts, and building catalogs using image galleries."

Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

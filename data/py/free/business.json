During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

      "label": "Inko is a collaborative whiteboard that lets you draw together using multiple iPad, iPhone or Mac, and even interact on Apple TV. Ideal for team coworkers in a brainstorming session, for a creative classroom project, or for an interactive meeting between a graphic designer and their client.\n\nCreate a group and just start drawing together! No need for complex network setup, or even any network at all, thanks to nearby connectivity. Be it in a bar, or on the beach. Oh, and your drawing even goes to the big screen too thanks to the free companion app for Apple TV! It instantly connects and interacts with all devices in the room. A great alternative to those bulky & expensive interactive boards. Inko 2 now brings remote collaboration over the Internet(*), Dark Mode support, a Mac app, and much more.\n\nEven though Inko is both simple and intuitive, it's also backed with advanced features like beautiful pixel-free rendering that stays sharp when zooming in. It also offers precise Apple Pencil support for an amazing drawing experience, lag-free and undo-capable real-time interactions, as well as hi-res PDF exports to share with your group when you’re done.\n\nCOLLABORATION & CONNECTIVITY\n\n• Highly responsive, \"appears-as-it-happens\" multi-user drawing with no lag.\n• Participants’ labels on drawing trails that show who is currently drawing.\n• Nearby collaboration: nomadic connectivity for local devices, even without Wi-Fi access point (peer-to-peer or LAN).\n• Remote collaboration: seamless connectivity over the Internet for global reach via invitation link sharing.\n• Up to 8 participants for peer-to-peer connectivity or 12 participants for LAN/Internet.\n• Group saving for quick setup of future sessions.\n• Security & privacy: TLS connection between devices (nearby) and end-to-end encryption with daily data removal on server (remote).\n• No account creation.\n\nDRAWING & VISUALIZATION \n\n• Beautiful pixel-free visualization that stays sharp when zooming, as well as vibrant colors on wide color displays (P3).\n• High-performance Metal rendering.\t\t\n• Extensive Apple Pencil support (finger action, angle, pressure, high-speed & predictive sampling).\n• Pen tool with two sizes & one calligraphic variant.\n• Lasso editing: select, move, rescale.\n• Ephemeral highlighter to point things out. On Apple TV, it even features innovative motion-driven interaction with the remote, like a laser pointer.\n• Single- and multi-user undo/redo & reliable syncing.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n\n• Optimized for latest iOS: file sharing, Split View Multitasking on iPad, Drag & Drop, Today Widget, Quick Actions, Universal Link, Siri Shortcuts, SF Symbols, Smart Screenshot, Dark Mode…\n• Universal app for iPad, iPhone & Mac. Free Apple TV companion app(**).\n• Export images, hi-res PDF, or native archive for a productive workflow.\n• iCloud sync for personal drawings.\n\nPRICING\nMulti-user collaboration requires a subscription. Two plans are proposed that enable all your devices (iPad, iPhone, Mac) and let other users join using just the free app:\n\n• Nearby Plan ($1.99/month, $9.99/year) enables local collaboration over peer-to-peer or LAN.\n• Remote Plan ($3.99/month, $29.99/year) enables remote collaboration over the Internet. Also includes all features of Nearby Plan.\n\nBoth plans offer a fully functional 7-day free trial. The free app provides full drawing capabilities in single-user mode, lets you access, organize, & export your drawings, and let you try out nearby collaboration for 5-minute time-limited sessions. Volume purchase (VPP) is available for schools & businesses: see Inko (Volume Ed.).\n\nHELP & FEEDBACK\n\nSend your questions/feedback to inko@creaceed.com\n\n(*) requires Remote Plan\n(**) only works with local connectivity. With older Apple TV models, you can use AirPlay Mirroring. \n\nTerms of Use: https://creaceed.com/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://creaceed.com/privacy"

These apps can display content, take notes, create forms, capture photos, signatures and GPS, scan bar codes, and generate workflows for a wide variety of business scenarios. You can also build web apps and chatbots.\n\nAppSheet uses data from your cloud storage -- Google Sheets, Excel on Office365, Dropbox or Box, Smartsheet, SalesForce, and a variety of databases (SQLServer, mySQL, Postgres, and DynamoDB). You can create an app in minutes and enhance it to create rich custom apps for your team, business, or enterprise. Check review sites like Capterra to learn how AppSheet’s modern technology platform outpaces older low-code solutions like PowerApps, Salesforce1, and App Maker. \n\nAppSheet is an ideal solution for many business, including those in property management, agriculture, supply chain, operations, salesforce management, education and more. Here are just a few scenarios:\n\nWORKING WITH REMOTE TEAMS\nApps built with AppSheet can help a remote team work with centralized data saved in spreadsheets (eg: in Google Drive, Box, or Droppox) or SQL databases. \n\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nMillions of people manage projects using Google Sheets, Excel, and Smartsheets. Project managers can build apps with AppSheet to display and share project data through a mobile device with other team members and stakeholders. Keep data centralized in a core spreadsheet and share only the parts that their audience needs to see. No more managing dozens of files that go back and forth via email!\n\nEDUCATION\nManage study plans, school rosters, grading, and group work by creating a custom app with charts, maps, text summaries and image galleries. Share the app securely with students and colleagues.\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT:\nKeep track of your customer pipeline on a Google Sheet but get the benefits of a streamlined custom mobile app using AppSheet. You can also interact with your data in new ways like building maps from your data, calling or messaging to telephone numbers, sending emails to contacts, and building catalogs using image galleries."

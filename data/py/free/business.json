During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

These apps can display content, take notes, create forms, capture photos, signatures and GPS, scan bar codes, and generate workflows for a wide variety of business scenarios. You can also build web apps and chatbots.\n\nAppSheet uses data from your cloud storage -- Google Sheets, Excel on Office365, Dropbox or Box, Smartsheet, SalesForce, and a variety of databases (SQLServer, mySQL, Postgres, and DynamoDB). You can create an app in minutes and enhance it to create rich custom apps for your team, business, or enterprise. Check review sites like Capterra to learn how AppSheet’s modern technology platform outpaces older low-code solutions like PowerApps, Salesforce1, and App Maker. \n\nAppSheet is an ideal solution for many business, including those in property management, agriculture, supply chain, operations, salesforce management, education and more. Here are just a few scenarios:\n\nWORKING WITH REMOTE TEAMS\nApps built with AppSheet can help a remote team work with centralized data saved in spreadsheets (eg: in Google Drive, Box, or Droppox) or SQL databases. \n\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nMillions of people manage projects using Google Sheets, Excel, and Smartsheets. Project managers can build apps with AppSheet to display and share project data through a mobile device with other team members and stakeholders. Keep data centralized in a core spreadsheet and share only the parts that their audience needs to see. No more managing dozens of files that go back and forth via email!\n\nEDUCATION\nManage study plans, school rosters, grading, and group work by creating a custom app with charts, maps, text summaries and image galleries. Share the app securely with students and colleagues.\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT:\nKeep track of your customer pipeline on a Google Sheet but get the benefits of a streamlined custom mobile app using AppSheet. You can also interact with your data in new ways like building maps from your data, calling or messaging to telephone numbers, sending emails to contacts, and building catalogs using image galleries."

It provides the same user- friendly experience that’s earned BBM millions of fans worldwide – with the end-to-end security enterprise needs. \n\nBBM Enterprise allows users to take advantage of the speed, reliability and privacy of BBM for faster communication, collaboration and decision making while providing security conscious organizations enhanced security over corporate data.\nBBM Enterprise is the ideal business communication tool because it is mobile and immediate. Unlike enterprise IM tools that were originally designed for use on the desktop, BBM Enterprise offers a truly mobile experience, on a variety of devices.\nWith BBM Enterprise, you only need one app to cover your mobile messaging and collaboration needs. Users know when their colleagues have received and read messages, so they can collaborate with confidence, in real-time. One-to-one chats, group discussions and file sharing all happen with the protection required by security-focused organizations – and all with an immediacy and accountability that’s hard to achieve through any other communication channel. \n\nBBM Enterprise uses a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic library and leverages BlackBerry’s secure infrastructure, trusted by security-conscious and regulated organizations around the world, to protect data while it’s in transit and at rest.  All the added security offered by BBM Enterprise happens in the background, so there’s no impact on the BBM user experience.\n\n\nTo use BBM Enterprise for personal use, you can buy an auto-renewable subscription from within the app. The BBM Enterprise auto-renewable subscription provides access to use the app for enhanced secure communication for 6 months with a 1 year free trial.  Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the end of the free trial period. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase.\nTerms of Service: https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/legal/blackberry-messenger"

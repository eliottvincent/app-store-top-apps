During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

      "label": "Never be without a schedule of California’s permanent disability values again.  The iComp Calculator by Haight Brown & Bonesteel, LLP displays the compensation rate and permanent disability value for any date of injury after 1983.  You input the average weekly earnings and it calculates the TTD rate and PD rate.  You input the percentage of permanent disability; the App calculates the number of weeks of payment, the lump sum value of permanent disability and, where appropriate, the life pension weekly rate for percentages up to 99.75%.  You can’t inadvertently use a permanent disability rate out of range for the date of injury, because the application shows the range permitted for each disability percentage and date.\n\nThis tool replaces all the charts and folders practitioners have had to carry around to obtain permanent disability values in California’s complex system.  The calculator is a short-cut that makes PD charts and tables obsolete.  And, it works off-line!   Try it free for 30 days, then purchase it for $4.99 if you want to continue to use it to save time and effort.\n\nNow, the App provides quick and easy assistance in calculating the number of days between any two dates.  When indemnity is paid between the two dates, the App calculates the sum of the benefits paid during multiple broken periods.  Calculating the total of indemnity benefits paid during several broken cycles, the temporary disability owed over broken periods of time, the percentage of permanent disability to be shared by multiple parties - all are part of the 2015 update.   \n\nCaution is of course required when using the App, and no legal opinion is expressed in providing this application or the results it returns.  Each user remains entirely and solely responsible for the proper use of the application, for confirming that the data used is accurate, and for confirming that the answers provided by the application conform to all the applicable provisions of the California Labor Code. Neither Haight Brown & Bonesteel LLP nor TZT&C LLC warrant neither the accuracy of the results nor the proper use of the application.  No liability will be assumed by the publisher, writer or sponsor of the application for its proper use or accuracy."

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

Para la concreción de este aporte a la sociedad, recibió apoyo de Posibillian Tech para el desarrollo informático, Florencia Roth en el diseño así como el apoyo de ASO (Asociación Argentina de Sordos) en la validación de las señas y la experiencia de usuarios.\n\nFuncionalidades:\n1.\tBuscador de señas, que pasa de Español a LSA.\n2.\tJuego para facilitar la práctica de LSA.\n3.\tConsejos para comunicarse adecuadamente con personas Sordas.\n\nLSApp es sencillo y no necesita de Internet para ser utilizado. Una vez descargada la aplicación en tu dispositivo, simplemente la usas cuando la necesitas.\n\n¿Por qué LSApp?\nAl momento de relacionarse con personas Sordas que se comunican con una lengua de señas en Argentina, corresponde recordar que su idioma primario y natural es LSA. Estas personas, pueden conocer otros medios alternativos de comunicación, como leer los labios de quien habla Español, pero su idioma natural será siempre LSA, por lo que LSApp permite una mejor comunicación, brindando inclusión social a las personas Sordas."

We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

The master traders  are doing the analysis  and sharing which pair, time, direction  and potential entry price and even including notes to add more clarity \n\n  the users can choose to copy and paste the information if they wish, but that is done at their own risk   \n\nFunctionalities include,  swiping past certain trades you don want, and going back into history to see how the trades panned out over time. Which allows the user an amazing experience   we believe this is a simple yet ground breaking idea  and it will change the way people learn.  Its applicable , simple and hands on !"

Look through the eyes of your iPhone or iPad* to see a high-tech window into the whole visible universe.\n\nAll you have to do is point your AR enabled device* at the sky and Star Chart will tell you exactly what you are looking at.\n\nUsing state of the art GPS technology, an accurate 3D simulation of the visible universe, and a great deal of technical wizardry, Star Chart calculates – in real time - the current location of every star, planet and moon visible from Earth and shows you precisely where they are; even in broad daylight!\n\nWant to know what that bright star is called? Point your device* at it – you might just find out it’s a planet!\n\nWant to know what the night sky looks like to people on the other side of the earth? Well just point your device down!\n\nWant to know where your star sign is in the sky? Star Chart will tell you all this and more.\n\n\nStar Charts features include:\n- Just point and view. When you hold your device up to the sky, Star Chart will automatically start tracking your movements to match the sky *.\n\n- Alternatively, look around the sky using finger gestures – perfect for armchair astronomers!\n\n- In a single app of less than 30MB, Star Chart dynamically scales its visuals and capabilities across all iOS devices to meet the high end capabilities of a retina display iPad while also running smoothly on the earliest iPhones and iPods.\n\n- Accurately depicts all the visible stars of the northern and southern hemispheres - a total of approximately 120,000 stars!\n\n- Fly to and explore all the planets of the solar system, their moons and the sun all rendered in beautiful 3D with state of the art visual effects. \n\n- Using the powerful Time Shift feature, simply tap the time button and smoothly shift up to 10,000 years forward or backward in time.\n\n- Displays all 88 constellations, with constellation imagery based on the beautiful artwork by 17th century astronomer Johannes Hevelius.\n\n- Includes the complete Messier catalogue of 110 exotic deep sky objects.\n\n- Tap on anything in the sky and get the facts on what you are looking at, including distance and brightness.\n\n- Very powerful zoom function, lets you view the sky in extra detail, using intuitive finger gestures.\n\n- Fully configurable. Star Chart displays only the sky objects that you are interested in.\n\n- Allows you to view the sky underneath the horizon. So now you can see where the sun is, even at night!\n\n- Manually set your location to find out what the sky looks like from anywhere in the world.\n\n- Supports dynamic device orientation viewing. Allows you to view the night sky whilst holding your iPhone/iPad* at any angle.\n\nSo point your iPhone/iPad* at the sky and see what's out there!\n\n------------\n* Augmented Reality mode is available on devices that include a built-in compass.

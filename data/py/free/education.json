      "label": "WHAT DOES SPEECH BLUBS OFFER?\n\nSpeech Blubs is a voice-controlled speech therapy app designed to help your child learn new sounds and words, and to practice speaking in a stimulating, educational environment. \n\n**FEATURED IN** Autism Parenting Magazine, Brisbane Kids, Speech Chick Therapy, Beautiful Speech Life, and The Speech Teacher.

Our apps have zero ads and no flashy features, thus providing a safe and non-intrusive learning experience. We use ABA therapy-inspired positive reinforcement that rewards kids with fun games and stickers for trying. Having the app at your fingertips makes it easy to practice in a routine that suits you, and helps avoid stressful disruptions that can upset your child.\nOur apps use multiple child and platform support, so with one sign-in ALL of your kids can use the app, no matter if it's on your device, a partner’s, or grandparents’. One sign-in also includes our new reading app READING BLUBS – designed with over 200 teachers and literacy experts.\nYou can now get access to language versions in US and UK English, Spanish, French, & (Brazilian) Portuguese. \n\nKEY FEATURES:\nParents’ Academy:\nA newly-added parent section provides access to an ever-growing content library of 350+ articles on parenting, homeschooling, education, speech therapy, and more.

When children watch their peers in real-time, their MIRROR NEURONS fire up! This scientifically proven and effective approach was confirmed in a UCLA study published by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and showed that kids learn faster and better when learning from other kids.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION, PRICING, & TERMS\nSpeech Blubs starts with a 7-day free trial.

      "label": "Las 4 técnicas que usa Memodi: \n1) Active recall/evocación activa: es el esfuerzo de recordar lo que acabas de leer. Se aprende mucho más si piensas activamente qué es lo que acabas de leer; el esfuerzo consolida la memoria. Por eso cada párrafo de Memodi contiene preguntas y ejercicios para que no olvides nada.\n2) Textos multimodales: el formato con colores, negritas, subrayados, y demás, permite \"romper\" el texto como si fuera un objeto para comprenderlo mejor. Y por supuesto, lo vuelve todo menos aburrido. Cada punto clave de Memodi es llamativo.\n3) Diversificación: estudios demuestran que es mejor leer temas \"salteados\" entre sí, porque eso permite crear conexiones y consolidar más el conocimiento.\n4) Repetición espaciada: Cuando lees algo, ¿cuánto recuerdas en 1 semana? ¿Y en 3 semanas? Aunque la memoria humana es increíble, estamos hechos para olvidar. Es ahí donde entra la Repetición Espaciada. Gracias al algoritmo, la aplicación va a agendar los repasos que tengas que hacer de los puntos clave, separándolos entre sí lo suficiente para que jamás los olvides. Así podrás recordar desde cosas tan esenciales como el tratamiento de la enterocolitis necrosante y la escala de Bell, hasta el cromosoma y gen que se muta en Fibrosis quística.\nLo único que tienes que hacer es dedicarle unos minutos durante el día, cuando sea que puedas y te sientas listo. Ideal para estudiar durante una guardia o mientras esperas tu café. Sin el problema de buscar información, de leer cosas que no sirven y por supuesto, de olvidar.\n\nMemodi está diseñada por un médico, pensando en la vida de otro médico. Guardias, cantidad exorbitante de información y temas, literatura únicamente escrita en inglés o de fuente dudosa, falta de tiempo o de energía para estudiar; todo eso se acabó.\nMemodi está diseñada para: estudiantes de medicina del último año, Médicos Internos (MIP), Médicos Pasantes del Servicio Social, Médicos Generales que quieran presentar el ENARM o que simplemente quieran tener la información siempre fresca y mantenerse actualizados, Médicos Especialistas que deseen no olvidar la Medicina de otras áreas.\n\nMemodi contiene:\nA) +2,500 puntos clave de +900 temas de toda la Medicina, y todas las especialidades: Dermatología, Endocrinología, Reumatología, Neumología, Cardiología, Infectología, Cirugía, Neurocirugía, Cirugía Vascular, Medicina Interna, Traumatología, Anestesiología, Gastroenterología, Pediatría, Ginecología, y más (para una lista completa visita: https://memodiapp.com/lista-de-temas). Los temas se encuentran divididos en 3 partes: 1) Definición, epidemiología, causas y patogenia, 2) Clínica y diagnóstico, 3) Tratamiento, prevención/screening, complicaciones.\nB) Los puntos clave están basados en los mejores Journals, Guías Internacionales y literatura reciente, pero traducidos al español y escritos de una manera fácil de leer; no tardarás más de 1 minuto por tarjeta. Además, todos tienen formato para que sea aún más fácil recordar y leer.\nC) Gracias a que la base de datos está en la nube, la información es actualizable con los últimos estudios y descubrimientos que cambian la práctica médica.\nD) Tiene una interfaz sencilla de usar; de hecho lo único que tienes que hacer es leer y presionar un botón para ver la siguiente tarjeta de información.\n\nFuncionamiento. Es fácil, inicia hoy mismo:\n1) Baja la aplicación y regístrate para sincronizar tu progreso en la nube.\n2) Selecciona cuántas tarjetas/puntos clave nuevos por día quieres ver. Te recomendamos 6-10.\n3) Dedícale unos minutos al día, y deja que el algoritmo haga el resto, mientras tú te dedicas a estudiar Medicina de la manera más inteligente con Memodi.\nTérminos de uso: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

That you can turn your phone into a sonar?\n\nphyphox gives you access to the sensors of your phone either directly or through ready-to-play experiments which analyze your data and let you export raw data along with the results for further analysis. You can even define your own experiments on phyphox.org and share them with colleagues, students and friends.\n\nSelected Features:\n- A selection of pre-defined experiments. Just press play to start.\n- Export your data to a range of widely used formats\n- Remote-control your experiment through a web interface from any PC on the same network as your phone. No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

Para la concreción de este aporte a la sociedad, recibió apoyo de Posibillian Tech para el desarrollo informático, Florencia Roth en el diseño así como el apoyo de ASO (Asociación Argentina de Sordos) en la validación de las señas y la experiencia de usuarios.\n\nFuncionalidades:\n1.\tBuscador de señas, que pasa de Español a LSA.\n2.\tJuego para facilitar la práctica de LSA.\n3.\tConsejos para comunicarse adecuadamente con personas Sordas.\n\nLSApp es sencillo y no necesita de Internet para ser utilizado. Una vez descargada la aplicación en tu dispositivo, simplemente la usas cuando la necesitas.\n\n¿Por qué LSApp?\nAl momento de relacionarse con personas Sordas que se comunican con una lengua de señas en Argentina, corresponde recordar que su idioma primario y natural es LSA. Estas personas, pueden conocer otros medios alternativos de comunicación, como leer los labios de quien habla Español, pero su idioma natural será siempre LSA, por lo que LSApp permite una mejor comunicación, brindando inclusión social a las personas Sordas."

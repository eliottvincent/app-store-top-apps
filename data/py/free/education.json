From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful.

      "label": "Start your exciting journey of learning Molecular Biology, Genetics, Evolution and the Chemistry of Life with Codon One!\n    The main course consists of modules that will teach you the essence of each subject in short sections and tiny chunks of distilled knowledge. Each section ends with a quick quiz to unlock the next one and to solidify the take-home-messages, so you will know all the most important aspects of each subject. Currently, we offer \"Module 1: Chemistry of Life\", \"Module 2: Genetics\" and \"Module 3: Evolution\", but we are already working hard on \"Module 4: Science History\" and further topics, which we will add soon one by one.\n    Meanwhile, take a deeper dive into the most important biological molecules, like nucleic acids and proteins and their building blocks in the molecule reference. All the structures of each of the 20 amino acids or the different nucleobases, and what each of the 64 codons encode is all hard to remember, so use this as your reference to come back to if you forget any of it.\n    Or test your knowledge in the separate quiz mode on the topics of biochemistry, genetics, evolution and the history of life science. We offer statistics for the quizzes you take, so you can keep track of how you are doing over time. We will constantly add more questions, but if you thought of one that we should add you can easily submit it right from the app. \n    Finally, we have put some fun and useful tools into the app. You can translate DNA sequences, get their reverse complement or receive useful statistics with the built-in sequence operator tool. See how changing single positions in codon triplets changes the encoded amino acid with the codon picker. And now you can encode your own message as amino acid single letter code into DNA sequence. Conversely, just translate the DNA to decode a message. These are the tools in more detail:\n\nSequence Operator\n- Write or paste DNA sequences and perform simple operations\n- Reverse the sequence, get the complement or the reverse complement\n- Transcribe it to RNA or translate into its amino acid sequence using all six possible open reading frames\n- Get stats for the sequence: length, GC content and melting temperature\n\nCodon Picker\n- Play around with the codon triplet picker to see which of the 64 codons corresponds to which amino acid or termination signal\n- Change bases at different positions and see how the genetic code works\n\nTriplet Encoder\n- Almost all letters of the alphabet symbolize an amino acid in the single letter code and each amino acid is encoded in DNA by codon triplets.\n- Write a message in amino acid sequence and get the encoded triplet sequence to hide your message in DNA. \n\nDid you find a bug or any other problem with the app? Send an email to codon-one@gmx.de and we will take care of it. Suggestions about improvements to the app are equally welcome."

APRENDIZAJE DE LA GRAMÁTICA con reglas bien ilustrativas\n2. ENTRENADOR para reforzar el vocabulario y las reglas\n3. MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO con ayuda de asociaciones\n4. COMPRENSIÓN AUDITIVA para aprender a entender el lenguaje oral\n5. CHECKPONTS para controlar lo aprendido y subsanar lagunas\n6. ¡PRÁCTICAS INUSUALES! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado para consolidar los conocimientos\n\nSimpler es ideal para principiantes. Con su ayuda puede aprender inglés desde cero. Asimismo puede hacer una prueba de nivel y empezar a estudiar a partir de cualquier nivel\n\n=====================\n\n¿POR QUÉ SIMPLER ES EL MÉTODO MÁS RÁPIDO Y EFICAZ DE APRENDER INGLÉS?\n\n1. Hemos creado el SISTEMA DE ENSEÑANZA DE LA GRAMÁTICA más claro y sencillo, conveniente a los principiantes. No le hace falta adentrarse en los mínimos detalles de la gramática inglesa, ni leer libros de texto. Descompusimos el inglés en átomos, seleccionamos solo la info más relevante, la reconstituimos y convertimos en estructuras fáciles e inteligibles. Cada regla gramatical del curso autodidacta Simpler es una instrucción corta que enseguida se refuerza con preguntas y prácticas.\n\n2. Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado. Le harán pensar en inglés, con ellas podrá ampliar su vocabulario y mejorar la destreza oral.\n\n6. ¡La eficacia está en la regularidad! Para mantener su motivación a aprender inglés, hacemos constancia de su TRABAJO A TODO RITMO. ¡Estudie todos los días y los resultados no se harán esperar!\n\n7. ¡Gane ESTRELLAS, desbloquee lecciones, trabaje a destajo y reciba regalos!\n\n==========================\n\nOPCIONES DE USO DEL CURSO AUTODIDACTA DE INGLÉS SIMPLER\n• La suscripción Premium le permite aprender inglés accediendo a todo el funcional de la app.\n• Después de confirmar la compra, el cargo se realizará desde su cuenta iTunes. \n• La suscripción se renovará automáticamente a no ser desactivada 24 horas antes del vencimiento del periodo actual.

      "label": "Truth or lie? What does your partner really think about?\nWhich signs can reveal a lie? How to read minds?\nLie theory concerns every one of us. Spot a liar!\n\nYou can meet both lie and truth in your life. It is easy to meet a lie on the streets, in shops or while watching morning breaking news on TV. Why do people lie? Everybody has their own reasons. Politicians hire consultants to help them look honest and sincere. But sometimes even the most reliable people lie. The reasons can be different. Our application about body language “Trick me” will help you understand more about the reasons and signs of lie.\n\nScientists suppose every human lies up to 20 times per day and often they don’t even realize it. This app will help you better understand yourself through teaching you non-verbal actions.\n\nWhat does your partner really think about?\nNowadays some professionals use lie detector (polygraph) for recognition of deception. Unfortunately, you can’t take a polygraph at the date with your beloved and it also would be odd to use it  with your business partners. Even in relationships between parents and children this device looks unappropriate. And even more - it’s accuracy, according to some resources, is under 80%.\n\nWhich signs can reveal a lie?\nSometimes ignorance is a bliss. Are you sure you really want to know when people lie to you? Even your closest ones. Using knowledge of body language you can find out more about people in your environment. Do you know that 98% of teenagers lie to their parents and 80% of people tell the white lie every day? Lie theory is a very wide topic, but you should just accept this fact - everybody lies.\n\nThe methods from this application are used in a lot of spheres: police, security services, psychiatric consultants, NLPrs and so on.\nThis app is useful for head managers, scholars, students and everybody who wants to be knowledgeable about psychology of lying and better understand people. \n\nA person thinks and talks using his/her whole body. For recognition signs of lie in this application we use a lot of kinds of body language, like:\n• Gaze direction\n• Touching of lips\n• Types of handshakes\n• Position of legs\n• Lie by telephone\n\nSince olden times people have had a desire to know what was on someone’s mind. After a while the whole direction has formed. Now it is known as physiognomy. Using this app “Lie to me” you will learn the language of body and gestures. You will find out the main principles of way of thinking and it will be easy for you to recognize a liar by his facial expression. \n\nSome specialists testify that absolutely every human being can learn how to spot a lie. You just have to understand the body language. Yes, it’s true! Very soon it’ll be easy for you to read people’s minds and microexpressions. In a while you will take the gasp of non-verbal communication. Unfortunately or, vise versa, hopefully there are no absolutely verified ways to uncover the deception. But due to this app you will be able to understand people, build close relationships and learn to control your own emotions. If you often deal with public speaking or are engaged in negotiations, it will totally help you to win round the audience. Besides, it will contribute to your personal advancement.\n\nDo you have any ideas how to improve this app? We will be glad to know about it: contact.yunari@gmail.com"

In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core American English words, form sentences, learn to speak American English phrases and take part in conversations.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own American English language tutor in your pocket.\nDownload the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the American English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of American English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right American English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your American English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak American English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning American English. Mondly teaches you American English vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational American English. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the American English verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• Advanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family.\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these English lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com"

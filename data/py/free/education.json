      "label": "We are a Ukrainian software developer creating apps for kids. We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nIf you need help, have questions, or just want to say, “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games.\n\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\n\nhttp://binibambini.com/privacy\n\nMore about Bini Games:\n\nBini Games is a group of enthusiastic professionals including designers, artists, animators, programmers, and musicians, who love to create digital games for children.\n\nAll our games are safe and do not collect any personal information."

All the contents of DangDai APP are from Volume one of a printed book series “A Course in Contemporary Chinese”. The level of Volume one is equivalent to CEFR A1 - A2 (noviced - intermediate mid). \nThe “A Course in Contemporary Chinese” series was first trialed at MTC and other language centers around Taiwan for a year. The current version underwent numerous drafts, and materialized under the careful guidance of the consultants, a diligent reading from the review committee, and feedback from teachers and students.\nMTC is very proud to bring you the DangDai APP. Furthermore, it is our hope that DangDai is a practical APP for your Mandarin Chinese learning.\n\n*FEATURES\n1.\tStudy Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese in one APP.\n2.\tSwitch to Chinese-Only Mode to train reading skills.\n3.\tEvery sentence has English translation and Pinyin (拼音).\n4.\tWell-chosen vocabulary with English translation, Pinyin (拼音), Mandarin Phonetic Symbols (注音, Zhuyin), parts of speech and audio pronunciations.\n5.\tBuild custom list of favorite vocabulary.\n6.\tLearn every Chinese character in the vocabulary via stroke animation and handwriting practice.\n7.\tHighlight key sentences in Reading Mode.\n8.\tVoiced by native Mandarin Chinese speaker.\n9.\tListen and read simultaneously.\n10.\tSet adjustable voice speed to fit different listening and speaking level.\n11.\tFollow the voice and record to practice speaking.\n12.\tLoop repeat/A-B repeat playback.\n13.\tBookmark and notebook functions.\n14.\tCompleted grammatical sections and appropriate example sentences.\n15.\tVarious types of exercises and practice tests formulated by Mandarin Chinese teaching experts.\n\n*PUBLISHED BY MTC\nThe Mandarin Training Center (MTC) was founded in the autumn of 1956 for teaching Chinese as a second language. Currently, the MTC is the largest and the most renowned Chinese language center, with around 1,700 students from more than 70 countries enrolled each academic quarter (three months.) \nMTC students come from different cultures and language backgrounds. They share the common goal of learning to communicate in Chinese effectively--some for employment; some for interests in Chinese culture and history. Many students have never learned Chinese before they enroll at the MTC, whereas some are good enough to start at intermediate and advanced levels. No matter what your motivation for learning Chinese is or the level of your Chinese, the MTC will do all it can to help you make rapid progress. \nOfficial website: mtc.ntnu.edu.tw/eng/\n\n*SUPPORT\nIf you have any suggestions, feedbacks or questions, please let us know. :)\nE-mail: mtcbook613@gmail.com\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/mtc.ntnu/"

      "label": "Truth or lie? What does your partner really think about?\nWhich signs can reveal a lie? How to read minds?\nLie theory concerns every one of us. Spot a liar!\n\nYou can meet both lie and truth in your life. It is easy to meet a lie on the streets, in shops or while watching morning breaking news on TV. Why do people lie? Everybody has their own reasons. Politicians hire consultants to help them look honest and sincere. But sometimes even the most reliable people lie. The reasons can be different. Our application about body language “Trick me” will help you understand more about the reasons and signs of lie.\n\nScientists suppose every human lies up to 20 times per day and often they don’t even realize it. This app will help you better understand yourself through teaching you non-verbal actions.\n\nWhat does your partner really think about?\nNowadays some professionals use lie detector (polygraph) for recognition of deception. Unfortunately, you can’t take a polygraph at the date with your beloved and it also would be odd to use it  with your business partners. Even in relationships between parents and children this device looks unappropriate. And even more - it’s accuracy, according to some resources, is under 80%.\n\nWhich signs can reveal a lie?\nSometimes ignorance is a bliss. Are you sure you really want to know when people lie to you? Even your closest ones. Using knowledge of body language you can find out more about people in your environment. Do you know that 98% of teenagers lie to their parents and 80% of people tell the white lie every day? Lie theory is a very wide topic, but you should just accept this fact - everybody lies.\n\nThe methods from this application are used in a lot of spheres: police, security services, psychiatric consultants, NLPrs and so on.\nThis app is useful for head managers, scholars, students and everybody who wants to be knowledgeable about psychology of lying and better understand people. \n\nA person thinks and talks using his/her whole body. For recognition signs of lie in this application we use a lot of kinds of body language, like:\n• Gaze direction\n• Touching of lips\n• Types of handshakes\n• Position of legs\n• Lie by telephone\n\nSince olden times people have had a desire to know what was on someone’s mind. After a while the whole direction has formed. Now it is known as physiognomy. Using this app “Lie to me” you will learn the language of body and gestures. You will find out the main principles of way of thinking and it will be easy for you to recognize a liar by his facial expression. \n\nSome specialists testify that absolutely every human being can learn how to spot a lie. You just have to understand the body language. Yes, it’s true! Very soon it’ll be easy for you to read people’s minds and microexpressions. In a while you will take the gasp of non-verbal communication. Unfortunately or, vise versa, hopefully there are no absolutely verified ways to uncover the deception. But due to this app you will be able to understand people, build close relationships and learn to control your own emotions. If you often deal with public speaking or are engaged in negotiations, it will totally help you to win round the audience. Besides, it will contribute to your personal advancement.\n\nDo you have any ideas how to improve this app? We will be glad to know about it: contact.yunari@gmail.com"

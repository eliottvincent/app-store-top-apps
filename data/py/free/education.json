In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally.

To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

While memorizing words, the frequency of lesson is more important than duration of each lesson. 10 minutes on each day of the week will be more productive than one hour of tuition a week.\n\nOne minute lessons - Taking into account busyness of modern life, we designed each lesson in the way so it would never take more than one minute to complete it! So you no longer need to search for free time to practice Japanese! Simply, once you get a chance, launch the app and do one lesson at a time =) Short sessions will not affect efficiency of word memorization.\n\nOnly useful Japanese words - Japanese for Beginners: LinDuo HD is a free and quick start to learn Japanese language! Unlike others, we have only the most useful words, which are divided into 180 topic based lessons. Quality is here!\n\nTeach-yourself Japanese is designed, that it will use your visual and echoic memory to help you memorize Japanese words fast and easy!\n\nSpecial illustrations - We use only specially developed infographics (developed by psychologists), so your eyes can quickly identify meaning of word or action without stressing them with small unnecessary details.\n\nWord pronunciation by native speakers - Our app will help you master pronunciation of Japanese words! Each word is recording by professional native speaker! Additionally, in the settings you can choose between male or female voice.\n\nDynamic lesson difficulty - The app changes lesson difficulty gradually as you progress. To achieve this, it keeps stats for EVERY word! Example: in the spelling mode, initially you need to insert several missing letters in a word, then create a word having extra letters and finally, when you are ready, you will need to type the entire word on the keyboard.\n\nModes for quick learning - The App includes four additional lesson types which are made of Favorites, Difficult, Old, Random words. You can add any word to your favorites and later create custom lesson from your Favorite words. Words are automatically added to \"Difficult\" (the ones you struggle to memorize) and \"Old\" (which you have not reviewed for a long time) sections. A \"Random\" mode will create a unique lesson.\n\nDo not need to know how to read - If you cannot read yet, no problem! Each word has a transcription in your language! And for more experienced ones, in the settings, you can choose a phonetic (like in a dictionary) transcription.\n\nAdditional features - Thanks to your reviews, we are constantly updating the app to make it better! To help you take care of your eyesight, with just one tap, you can activate dark theme. If you temporarily do not have internet access, no problem! The App can work offline as well!\n\nReview Past Material - Many good apps do not pay enough attention to review past material! For this purpose we created the word game \"True or False\". It is very simple, but it's addictive and the most importantly, it helps to repeat past material and never to forget it!\n\nSupport and Contact Us\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please never hesitate to send us an email admin@lin-duo.com or use in-app contact form. We are always happy to answer your questions!"

      "label": "Learn to read Spanish\n\nFun games to learn to read from 3 to 7 years old. Free 14 games with 2 levels.\n\nReading is one of the most important skills that can be taught in preschool and the first years of Elementary because it is the basis of everything that our little ones will make at school and in most of their adult life.\n\nKids love computers and tablets, they are digital natives. We should take advantage of this to review\nor improve what they are already working at the school.\n\nMETHOD\nLearn to read Spanish with phonics is designed for kids from the age of 4 until 6 or 7 years old and even adults to improve pronunciation. \n\nThis method is divided into 30 lessons, starting with vowels and continuing with L, M, S, T, P, N, D, F, H, C, Q, CH, G, GUE, R, -rr- - R, B, V, G, J, GE, GUE, Y, Z, CE, LL, X, K.\n\nEach lesson contains 14 games, all available in two different levels. Ideal for parents and teachers looking for a way to practice and ask the kids the first syllables and words in Spanish. Encourage the child to listen and resolve the exercises; it is not necessary to understand everything.\n\nLearning to read is a long process, which can take more than one year. We recommend practicing a few minutes a day and from time to time back to what has already been learned and always adapting the type and level of exercise. It is very important to be perceived as a game.\n\nLEVELS\nAll games have 2 difficulty levels, which can be changed at any time. The child progresses at his own pace, you can interrupt the game and come back another time. As the games get resolved, the child obtains  fruits.\n\nThe first level is suitable for three years and in some cases even earlier with help from parents or educators. In games it can be solved with the help of the statement. The second level is more complex. We must invite them to work it out as they are able to do it, but always remember that learning is and must be fun.\n\nAs parents or guardians, we recommend that the difficulty suits the child's abilities. In no event press excessively to complete the level or move to the next stage.\n\n\nABILITIES\n\n· Visual and auditory memorization\n· Identification and Association\n· Discrimination\n· Understanding\n· Literacy\n\nOPTIONS\nOn the home screen:\n- Enable / Disable background music\n- Play full screen\nAt Tikis menus:\n- Change the font: uppercase, lowercase, and cursive handwriting.\n- Enable/Disable automatic activity: active means that after a number of exercises set, will automatically switch to another game.\n- Shuffle: rearrange the syllables.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS \nYou can create up to three profiles (avatars) for different children and for each of them you can see the progress at each level as well as the rights and wrongs and the determined percentage of which is represented in the form of fruit.\n\nFruits are a fun way to motivate kids to continue playing. When you have some in the basket, click on it to give them to the little aliens. \nIf you want a more complete picture of progress press on the repotrs button at tikis screen.\n\nGAMES\nFor each lesson you will find 11 games:\n1. DOLPHIN: Presentation of the word and its parts.\n2. BALLOONS: Identification of the letters of the syllable.\n3. CLOUDS: lace shape of each syllable.\n4.

      "label": "Brainscape’s SMART FLASHCARDS foster hyper-efficient studying and strong habits to DOUBLE your learning speed, with the strongest implementation of spaced repetition and active recall of any flashcard app on the planet! (And probably in the universe, assuming some super intelligent alien species out there hasn’t beaten us to it.)\n\nWith a knowledge bank created by millions of global users and experts, you can FIND, MAKE, and SHARE flashcards anytime, anywhere, and on any device, while keeping all your content meticulously ORGANIZED and seamlessly IN SYNC across web, mobile, and all your devices.\n\nHow does it work? Brainscape’s intelligent study system has been designed in accordance with decades of proven cognitive science to help you learn faster and remember longer than with any other flashcard app. (And we don’t waste time on games. Our flashcards are for serious learners.)\n\nBrainscape distills any subject down into bite-sized facts (neatly organized into decks and classes), which are posed as question-and-answer pairs, compelling you to actively recall information from scratch. You then rate how well you know each concept on a scale of 1 to 5, and Brainscape determines the perfect time interval at which to repeat that flashcard again. \n\nIf you know the answer well, you’ll see that flashcard less often; if you don’t know it well, you’ll see it again and again, at frequent intervals, until it’s deeply ingrained into your brain. And it’s this totally unique combination of active recall, self-assessment (metacognition), and spaced repetition that is scientifically proven to significantly slash your required study time!\n\nWhere do all of Brainscape’s awesome flashcards come from? Three places:\n\nTHE WORLD’S TOP EXPERTS. Brainscape partners with top publishers, schools, and educators to create comprehensive collections of certified flashcards for a diverse array of subjects, from foreign languages (we are the best language-learning tool in the world) to high-stakes exams like the AP series, MBE (bar exam), Series 7, NCLEX, MCAT, and more.\n\nYOUR PEERS. Top students, professors, teachers, tutorpreneurs, and businesses around the world have created over 1 million subjects that are available to search on Brainscape’s Knowledge Genome.\n\nYOU! You can easily create and organize thousands of multimedia flashcards featuring text, images, and even audio files, both on Brainscape’s website AND within the app itself. You can also share your decks with your classmates and collaboratively develop content together. \n\nHow much does it cost? Creating and sharing great flashcards is FREE. (Woohoo!) And for unlimited access to ALL of Brainscape's user-generated and premium, expert-curated content, as well as optional features, like bookmarks and card reversibility, you can upgrade to Pro for $19.99 (monthly), $59.99 (every 6 months), or $95.99 (annually). Alternatively, you can unlock a LIFETIME of learning with Brainscape for a one-time cost of only $199.99 American dolla billz.\n \nThe fine print: The three recurring subscriptions (monthly, semiannual, and annual) will renew automatically within 24 hours before the end of the current period, unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the period. You can cancel auto-renewal any time by going to Account Settings, and the cancellation will apply after the active subscription period is complete. Go ahead and learn more about our Terms and Privacy Policy at brainscape.com/terms.\n\nWhat’s on the horizon? It’s our vision to empower everyone, everywhere to rise to the challenge of personalized forever-learning. And for this reason, we love hearing from our community of users: it’s through your feedback that we can continue to innovate our learning platform to be more convenient, efficient, and even fun and social to use!"

Other dictionaries just leave you guessing!\n\n• We've got Optical Character Recognition (OCR) too. Spotted some Chinese you can't read? Capture a photo of some Chinese text from a menu, book or sign, and the app identifies and translates the characters for you.  \n\n• Search for words by part of speech - simply type the abbreviated type followed by a period (.). For example, \"ma n.\" gets you \"ma\" words that are nouns.\n\n• Mistyped a word? Helpful spelling suggestions get you to the right results fast.\n\n• Words feature both example sentences and measure words for nouns. It's time to move beyond \"个\"! And best of all it's all connected: tap examples and measure words to open them as full dictionary entries.\n\n• trainchinese is great for students: it includes more than a thousand vocabulary lists covering topics from International Relations to American Football Teams and more. Feel like something's missing? Users often get in touch to ask for lists on the topics they're studying, and we're happy to oblige! You'll also find lists containing HSK-level words (both old and new standards), plus TOCFL lists for students in Taiwan!\n\n• Highlight words with your finger for super-fast access to character animations, related searches and more!\n\n• Whether you're studying the Simplified (mainland China and Singapore) or Traditional (Hong Kong and Taiwan) variants, we've got you covered! Easily switch between them or choose to display both in dictionary results and on flash cards. Even better, you can use the phonetics you're comfortable with - choose from Pinyin with tone marks, Pinyin with tone numbers or even Zhuyin characters (from the BoPoMoFo system used in Taiwan).\n\n• Create flash cards with audio and animation from dictionary entries. Organise them into lists, and share them with friends (or students).\n\n• Our Spaced Repetition system ensures you'll memorize words for good.\n\n• Train your way: each card is available in four different modes to test different aspects of Chinese study. See Chinese, Pinyin or English and get tested on translation, and even compare your handwriting to a stroke-order animation side-by-side, synchronized! Or if you prefer, there's multiple choice training too (for a real challenge, try it in \"Dictation\" mode!).\n\n• Flash cards are saved on your device and synchronized with trainchinese.com, where you can also train with them and find more great content.\n\n• Add study notes to your flash cards - they're saved and backed up at trainchinese.com.\n\nDon't forget to check out our other apps (tap our company name in iTunes for more info):\n\n - Chinese Writer\n - Chinese Audio Trainer\n - My Chinese Library (phrase books)\n - Pinyin Trainer\n - Number Trainer"

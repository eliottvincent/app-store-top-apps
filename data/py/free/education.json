We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nIf you need help, have questions, or just want to say, “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games.\n\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\n\nhttp://binibambini.com/privacy\n\nMore about Bini Games:\n\nBini Games is a group of enthusiastic professionals including designers, artists, animators, programmers, and musicians, who love to create digital games for children.\n\nAll our games are safe and do not collect any personal information."

The user interface is beautiful and straightforward, the controls are easy to use and most settings are just a tap or two away. Classic Sky Map shows you thousands of the brightest stars, the Moon, planets, constellations, meteor showers and more. And it's painless. \n\n\nFree Features:\n\n- Live Tracking. Simply point your device toward the stars and the sky map aligns itself automatically, showing you the portion of the sky at which you are looking. If your device has a compass, Classic Sky Map uses it automatically. If not, you can tell Classic Sky Map where the North is, and it aligns the sky map accordingly.\n\n- Live Earth Map. Quickly jump from one city to another by tapping on a map that shows the Earth's day and night boundary in real-time. If you allow it, Classic Sky Map can detect your current location automatically. You can also create custom viewing locations in seconds.\n\n- Fast Forward and Rewind. Accelerate or reverse time to understand how stars and planets appear to move in the sky over a longer period of time.\n\n- Beautiful Constellation Images. We put a tremendous amount of work into creating beautiful constellation images inspired by antique engravings and aligning them precisely with the stars.\n\n- Sharing. Share snapshots of the sky map with your friends at the tap of a button.\n\n- Quick Help. Should you have any questions while using Classic Sky Map, a concise, illustrated user guide will help answer them quickly.\n\n\nFull Version Features (In-App Purchase):\n\n- Interactive Search. Simply type in a search field, pick an object from a list of matches, then point your device toward the sky. An arrow appears and guides you until you are pointing your device toward the object you selected. If the object is not yet visible in the sky, its next rise time is displayed.\n\n- Sky Events. Classic Sky Map shows a list of current sky events such as meteor showers, eclipses and more and helps you quickly locate them in the sky.\n\n- Night Vision. Classic Sky Map's night vision mode helps minimize loss of dark adaptation. And we went the extra mile to make it look great in cyan, orange or red.\n\n- Extra Information. Tooltips and an information panel show details about stars, planets, the Moon, meteor showers and more.\n\n- Personalization Options. Personalize your sky map by turning various guides and display options on or off.\n\n\nHave fun!"

Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

      "label": "An educational game to learn the location of notes on the fretboard of the guitar and other stringed instruments. Eleven instruments are available, including bass (4/5/6 strings), mandolin, ukulele and banjo.\n\nYou are presented with a random note on the fretboard, and are offered a variety of choices for the correct answer. Just pick the button corresponding to the correct choice to score a hit!\n\nThe new staff training mode also helps you learn the position of notes on the musical staff on the fretboard of your instrument.\n\nAs your score gets better and you manage to identify notes faster across the entire fretboard, your working knowledge of the instrument increases! \n\nGame mode provides a fun way to make progress. Work your way through levels of increasing difficulty and compete with your friends!\n\nWHAT ARTISTS SAY ABOUT THE APP\n\n“ Learning the notes on the fretboard is key to any guitarist's development on the instrument, and [Fretuoso] is a neat way to get that info burned into your brain without having to carry a guitar with you everywhere you go. Pretty cool! ”\n-- Bryan Beller (Dethklok, Steve Vai, Mike Keneally)\n\n“ This is one of the best apps I've seen in a while. It's simple, fun and educational. Very useful for guitar players as a lot of [them] tend to play by ear and not care much about knowing the fretboard. ”\n-- Rick Musallam (Mike Keneally, Gryphon Labs)\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Train your ear while improving your working knowledge of the instrument.\n- Learn the position of notes on the musical staff; say goodbye to tabs!\n- Ten different beautiful, realistic-looking instruments! Includes 4 guitars, 3 basses, mandolin, ukulele and banjo.\n- Focus your training on particular parts of the fretboard: any range of frets, any subset of the strings.\n- Many common tunings are built in, but custom tunings can also be created. \n- Visualize your progress on the fretboard; statistics are kept for every fret. \n- Smart Learning Engine: the app automatically focuses on sections of the fretboard where you are weaker.\n- Integration with Game Center, Twitter and Facebook: compete with your friends and share your progress!\n- Left-handed mode is available.\n\nThis version comes with free access to a limited subset of each of the available instruments. Each of the instruments can be fully unlocked via in-app purchase."

      "label": "Thousands of users love Intelli Flashcards for its simplicity, effectiveness and elegance.\n\nBut first things first. This app is not free, as the value you get using it properly is enormous. I also don’t want you to do a blind bargain by making this app a paid one. So here is the deal: download it for free, try it with the only limitation of 50 flashcards, and if you love it, support the project by making an in-app purchase.\n\nYou add flashcards on your own, with vocabs or information you want to remember. Alternatively, you can import a 2-column CSV file with vocabs, if you have one.\n\nThe app is built around Spaced Repetition technique, which is not the best to learn new information (yes, I was wrong believing that initially), but the best to keep the information you’ve learnt. However, you can also learn with flashcards if you have a good visual memory. The best combination: learn new information by building up the associations and move that information to long-time memory by repeating it with flashcards.\n\nUnder the hood you will find Sebastian Leitner’s algorithm which basically has two simple rules: if you remember what’s on the back side of the card, the repeating interval is doubled (1-2-4-8-16 days and so on). If you forget the back side, start all over again with daily repeating. \n\nIntelli Flashcards was designed to be used every day by someone, who learns foreign language. I’m aware of the fact, that average user would add 1500+ flashcards on his learning path. He might be outdoors and in a rush, so the process of creating a new flashcard is 0 clicks away - it’s right on the main screen! The repeating session is just 1 click away.\n\nAfter a year of testing the spaced repetition algorithm, Derek Sivers (entrepreneur, programmer, founder of CD Baby and just a great person) stated that it was the most helpful learning technique he has tried for 14 years. To read more about Derek’s experiment, visit  www.sivers.org/srs \n\nFrom developer: after finishing working on Intelli, I started to use it to learn Spanish just to test the effectiveness of this algorithm. Intelli is not the only tool I’ve used, but it had the biggest impact on the learning speed and effectivity. I went from 0 to C1 level in Spanish in just 1 year, spending in average 15-20 minutes on learning every day. To read about other tools I’ve used to learn Spanish, go to www.boweidmann.com/language-learning\n\nBut then I’ve stumbled upon a great article about language learning, written by Tim Ferriss, the best-selling author and self-experimenter:\n\nhttp://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/16/how-to-learn-any-language-in-record-time-and-never-forget-it/\n\nInspired by that article, I’ve worked on the possibility of adding images directly to flashcards. Version 3.0 was born. Thank you, Tim! That function has enhanced the experience the users have got with the app. And it’s much more interesting to recall a vocab looking on image. That’s how Rosetta Stone works. That’s how we recall our native vocabs. Maybe I should start a new language just to test this technique with images. ;)\n\nUser experience is one of the keywords this app is built around. So your opinion on that is very important to me. You can contact me personally out of the app and receive my response as soon as possible. \n\nWhen I develop a new version of the app, I make sure new functionality does not affect the original user experience. However, it’s hard to predict the way you are going to make use of it. So if there is some unexpected behavior of the app, feel free to tell me about it.\n\nAnd when somewhere in the future you realize, Intelli has supported you a lot on your path of learning, I’d love your short review in AppStore."

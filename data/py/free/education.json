      "label": "Las 4 técnicas que usa Memodi: \n1) Active recall/evocación activa: es el esfuerzo de recordar lo que acabas de leer. Se aprende mucho más si piensas activamente qué es lo que acabas de leer; el esfuerzo consolida la memoria. Por eso cada párrafo de Memodi contiene preguntas y ejercicios para que no olvides nada.\n2) Textos multimodales: el formato con colores, negritas, subrayados, y demás, permite \"romper\" el texto como si fuera un objeto para comprenderlo mejor. Y por supuesto, lo vuelve todo menos aburrido. Cada punto clave de Memodi es llamativo.\n3) Diversificación: estudios demuestran que es mejor leer temas \"salteados\" entre sí, porque eso permite crear conexiones y consolidar más el conocimiento.\n4) Repetición espaciada: Cuando lees algo, ¿cuánto recuerdas en 1 semana? ¿Y en 3 semanas? Aunque la memoria humana es increíble, estamos hechos para olvidar. Es ahí donde entra la Repetición Espaciada. Gracias al algoritmo, la aplicación va a agendar los repasos que tengas que hacer de los puntos clave, separándolos entre sí lo suficiente para que jamás los olvides. Así podrás recordar desde cosas tan esenciales como el tratamiento de la enterocolitis necrosante y la escala de Bell, hasta el cromosoma y gen que se muta en Fibrosis quística.\nLo único que tienes que hacer es dedicarle unos minutos durante el día, cuando sea que puedas y te sientas listo. Ideal para estudiar durante una guardia o mientras esperas tu café. Sin el problema de buscar información, de leer cosas que no sirven y por supuesto, de olvidar.\n\nMemodi está diseñada por un médico, pensando en la vida de otro médico. Guardias, cantidad exorbitante de información y temas, literatura únicamente escrita en inglés o de fuente dudosa, falta de tiempo o de energía para estudiar; todo eso se acabó.\nMemodi está diseñada para: estudiantes de medicina del último año, Médicos Internos (MIP), Médicos Pasantes del Servicio Social, Médicos Generales que quieran presentar el ENARM o que simplemente quieran tener la información siempre fresca y mantenerse actualizados, Médicos Especialistas que deseen no olvidar la Medicina de otras áreas.\n\nMemodi contiene:\nA) +2,500 puntos clave de +900 temas de toda la Medicina, y todas las especialidades: Dermatología, Endocrinología, Reumatología, Neumología, Cardiología, Infectología, Cirugía, Neurocirugía, Cirugía Vascular, Medicina Interna, Traumatología, Anestesiología, Gastroenterología, Pediatría, Ginecología, y más (para una lista completa visita: https://memodiapp.com/lista-de-temas). Los temas se encuentran divididos en 3 partes: 1) Definición, epidemiología, causas y patogenia, 2) Clínica y diagnóstico, 3) Tratamiento, prevención/screening, complicaciones.\nB) Los puntos clave están basados en los mejores Journals, Guías Internacionales y literatura reciente, pero traducidos al español y escritos de una manera fácil de leer; no tardarás más de 1 minuto por tarjeta. Además, todos tienen formato para que sea aún más fácil recordar y leer.\nC) Gracias a que la base de datos está en la nube, la información es actualizable con los últimos estudios y descubrimientos que cambian la práctica médica.\nD) Tiene una interfaz sencilla de usar; de hecho lo único que tienes que hacer es leer y presionar un botón para ver la siguiente tarjeta de información.\n\nFuncionamiento. Es fácil, inicia hoy mismo:\n1) Baja la aplicación y regístrate para sincronizar tu progreso en la nube.\n2) Selecciona cuántas tarjetas/puntos clave nuevos por día quieres ver. Te recomendamos 6-10.\n3) Dedícale unos minutos al día, y deja que el algoritmo haga el resto, mientras tú te dedicas a estudiar Medicina de la manera más inteligente con Memodi.\nTérminos de uso: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

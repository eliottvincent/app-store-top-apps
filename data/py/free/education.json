Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain.

It also includes some advanced words to encourage the development of the children who are already speaking.\n\n\nThis game has been specifically designed to improve the following areas:\n\n- Hand-eye coordination\n- Concentration\n- Classification of objects\n- Visual perception\n- Vocabulary\n\nMy First Words features voices in Spanish, Portuguese and English, so if your baby has already learned all the words, encourage him or her to learn languages!\n\n\nPlayToddlers’ games encompass different areas of toddler’s personal growth, and have been specifically designed to be used by babies, with a simple and attractive interface that allows them to use the application by themselves, improving their development and self-esteem."

Practice every day to improve your vocab knowledge.\n\n- 200 vocab words picked by an expert TOEFL tutor\n- Definitions and example sentences for every word\n- Decks for every difficulty level\n- Track your progress as you study\n- Smart algorithm focuses your practice for efficient learning\n\nThis app gives you free access to all of Magoosh’s TOEFL flash cards.

Chris has been teaching the GRE for more than 10 years, runs a popular vocabulary series on YouTube and he’s also written an eBook on vocabulary. He is unbeatable in Scrabble, or any other word game for that matter. Lucas studied creative writing at Bard College and has been teaching English grammar and standardized tests since 2008.\n\nReview that really sticks\n-------------------------\nAcademic research has found that memories are formed by repeated exposure to new information, so Magoosh’s flashcard app uses a spaced repetition system. Words you are learning will reappear frequently (occurring less frequently the better you know them) and words you already know won’t be repeated. The TOEFL word list is also culled to only 200 so that you don't waste time learning unimportant words.\n\nAbout Magoosh\n-------------\nWe're an online test prep company with a focus on teaching the TOEFL through videos and personalized customer support.\n\nIn addition to our online course, we blog about TOEFL strategies and test-taking tips at http://magoosh.com/gre\n\nMore TOEFL study tools\n----------------------\nWhen you’re ready to practice for the full TOEFL exam, Magoosh’s website has a complete online video course covering everything on the test.

      "label": "Welcome to Pepi Wonder World Lite! It‘s a magical, fairy tale inspired adventure into an island filled with fantasy characters, magic spells and royal fun!\n\nCREATIVE PLAY\n \nThis is the most magical Pepi game so far and by that we mean fantastic spells, adventurous knights, dancing horses and baby dragons. Its positively insane and highly inspirational, cause the game is all about the fairy tales we love so much! Imagine a dollhouse or a sandbox filled with toys to the brim. You pick and choose your favorites, mix and match characters and items. Puss in Boots finally ruling the kingdom, warrior princess crafting magic swords, giant music bands, comprised of cyclops and... ...giants! Everything is possible in King‘s Castle where gameplay scenarios have no limits. Same as our imagination when we roleplay in fantasy worlds. \n\nLEARN THROUGH PLAY\n\nPepi Wonder World Lite is fun and safe edutainment for kids and their parents. Even though we dive into fantasy worlds we remain true to our core values and education through moderation. Pepi Wonder World Lite is best when its played together. Ask kids to create their own fairy tales and use the game as a digital stage. Dozens of characters and hundreds of usable items is a perfect opportunity to learn new words, storytelling and just a little bit of acting through roleplay.\n\nCURIOSITY... GAVE CAT BOOTS!\n\nWe all know that saying, but in our games curiosity and exploration is the key! With every new game in our dollhouse series, we are increasing the number of items, animations, and possible combinations. We encourage kids to be brave in their explorations, thus we have even more hidden items, secret areas and cheeky puzzles in our kingdom this time. The most amazing thing about this? Well, we‘re looking to add more fairy tale worlds to our game, so in the future, your characters will be able to board the ship and travel to the Dwarf Island, where new adventures await! \n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• 30+ new characters including knights, princess‘es, baby dragons and ghosts!\n• Loaded with animations and interactions — use musical instruments, craft items, shoot bows, have crazy, medieval fun! \n• Proper fairy tale world, filled with enchanting spells, secrets and surprises!\n• Find the hidden keys and explore secret rooms to find even more toys to play with.\n• Use, mix and match any item and equipment You can find and get surprising results!\n• Different scenes. Behold the magic Kingdom — from shiny throne rooms, to darkest dungeons!  \n• King‘s kitchen: cook like there‘s a kingdom to feed, dine like kings and queens! \n• Play together, game supports multitouch!\n• Dedicated for 3-7-year-old kids, but will bring joy for the whole family."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

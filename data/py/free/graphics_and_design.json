      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

Also, \"Mycons\"  =  \"my icons\"... get it??? Right... moving on...\n\nHow does it work? \nDesign your custom icons in the \"Icon Studio\" section. Think of a Mycons icon as being made up of 2 components. A background, and an overlayed symbol/logo. Design your custom background with colors, gradients, photos, etc. Then, select a logo or symbol to place somewhere over it. Export your beautifully aesthetic app icons from Mycons, then use the Shortcuts app to create your beautifully aesthetic Home Screen!\n\nMarketplace? \nYou can also buy premium theme packs in the marketplace, if you want. They all come with free iPhone wallpapers too!\n\nWhy is this better than buying icon packs? \nExponential flexibility! When you spend $7-$20 on other premium icon packs, you only get a limited set of icons. If the pack doesn’t have one with the Pinterest logo... how do you know your new pretty icon is for the Pinterest app? Mycons works differently. You still get beautiful custom icons, but you can stamp them with your pick from thousands of brand logos and symbols."

      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier.

The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features.

You might feel anxious, constantly irritated, or even depressed. There is no shame in getting help while you get back on your feet. \n\nSensa is here to guide you through the entire journey to self-care, unlocking scientifically backed information to help you understand yourself better on your own terms.\n\nJust in 1–3 months, you will start your day with a new outlook on life.\n\nMeet your calm mind assistant:\n\n\nSelf-paced lessons\n\nHeal at your own pace and learn all about calming your mind with daily lessons about mental health. Understand how your thoughts, emotions, and behaviour are tightly interconnected, and start to untangle negative patterns using proven techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) experts.\n\n\nEasy daily tasks\n\nTry out quick yet effective 10–30-minute activities that help you create healthy lifelong habits. Find out which new habits are perfect for you and create a daily routine that puts you at ease. Build up your resilience to stress as you set up your morning, evening, and wind-down routines that bring peace to your day.\n\n\nMood journal\n\nDeep dive into your subconsciousness as you explore how you tend to react to challenges and victories. Track your mood in a mood journal, analyse the patterns that emerge, identify emotional triggers, and understand yourself better with every passing day. To feel better, you might need to eliminate certain stressors – but first, you must learn to identify them.\n\n\nHabit-building tips and strategies\n\nSmall changes repeated daily are more effective than massive changes repeated once. Implement new habits with surgical precision , and find out the easiest way to get better for years to come. Understand and manage your anxiety triggers at your own pace to always feel in control with tips and strategies that have helped thousands before you.\n\n\nWeekly assessments\n\nComplete the DASS-21 depression, anxiety, and stress self-evaluation surveys to track how your outlook changes over time. These weekly assessments are a helpful tool that will provide you with a deeper understanding of how you are feeling at the moment and guide you toward feeling better with no pressure.\n\n\nQuick relief exercises\n\nSometimes, long-term strategies are not enough, and you need help on the spot. No matter if it’s a big presentation, an aftermath of a fight, or a spiral of negative thoughts – you can put your mind to rest with quick-relief exercises. Explore stress-free activities and relax in stressful situations quickly without ever losing control.\n\nIt's time to embark on your journey\nWe are glad to be here for you and guide you on your new path. \n\nDisclaimer: Mental self-help apps like Sensa are not a replacement for or a form of therapy, nor are they intended to cure, treat, or diagnose medical conditions, including psychiatric conditions.

      "label": "Sevensix is an AI-powered app that analyzes your tennis technique to help you upgrade your game. With our award-winning app, you can compare your technique to a professional tennis player.\n\nWe are offering a groundbreaking new way to practice your technique, on or off the court. Powered by cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision, our app is loaded with tools to improve your swing technique.  \n\nCapture your tennis swing with your iPhone! Our AI engine will automatically detect your body movement, swing curve, timing, ball impact point, and compare your swing attributes to a professional player. Get a full visual analysis instantly, in real-time, with individual feedback to fix mistakes quickly and upgrade your game. It’s like having a world-class coach in your pocket! \n\nYou will receive a performance score based on similarity to a professional player, the timing of your movement (kinetic chain), and the ball impact point.\n\nOur AI engine is self-learning and packed with the experience of world-renowned technical tennis coaches and experts.\n\nEasy setup.\nNo expensive sensors, advanced video equipment needed. Just add a tripod, or ask a friend to record your swing. \n\nPricing\nFree 7-day trial. Continue with either a monthly or a discounted yearly subscription.\n\nSevenSix Membership\nAfter the trial period, users will have to subscribe to access premium features.\n\nPremium Features\n* Access to all swing types\n* Get actionable AI Coaching advice after each stroke.\n* Individual feedback on your swing curve, timing, and impact point.\n* Score on all your strokes\n* Share your videos,  and challenge your coach or tennis pairs.\n* In-depth AI analysis\n* Access to tips on how to improve your stroke types.\n* Cloud storage to save your device hard disk capacity\n* Access to All new features\n* Achievement Badges on Tournaments and competitions\n* Rating on all your strokes and in total\n\nHow does it work?\nWhen you upload a video in our app, our AI reads your core biometrical points (feet, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, etc) and how you are moving these points during a swing. We then analyze every movement and compare it to our Pro’s swing. Any deviation, no matter how small, is pointed out in a 3D map and complex graphs. Through thousands of swings, our AI has trained its algorithms to be able to give users a score from 1 to 100, primarily focusing on swing curve, timing, and impact point.  \n\nOur AI captures the impact by listening to the sound of the player hitting a ball. At this exact frame, it sees where the wrist is compared to the body and if it is moving up or down. All compared to our Pro. \n\nEven though the tennis technique is somewhat individual, a correct tennis stroke takes into account the correct movement to create energy from the legs to your hips, shoulders, and wrist in this exact sequence often named the kinetic chain. Please note that different techniques and grips can create a different swing curve, but rest assured that Timing and Impact point is something any tennis player must practice to upgrade their technique and to prevent injuries.  \n\nSevenSix membership is available for subscription as either a monthly or yearly renewable subscription. Payment will be charged on your iTunes account upon the expiration of the free trial period. Subscription renews unless the subscription is canceled or auto-renew turned off at least 24 hours before the free trial period expires.

      "label": "Keep Swiss COVID certificates easily and securely on your mobile phone\n\nCOVID Certificate is the official app for storing and presenting Swiss COVID certificates. It is developed by the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication FOITT on behalf of the Federal Office of Public Health.\nIn Switzerland, people who have been vaccinated, or who have tested negative or recovered from COVID can apply for a COVID certificate.\n\nCOVID certificates are issued in hard copy or electronic format serve as proof of: \n1. Vaccination against COVID-19\n2. Recovery from Sars-CoV-2 infection\n3. A negative result following Sars-CoV-2 test analysis\n\nHow the app works\n\nWhen the app is first launched after installation on the mobile device, a brief introduction provides information on how to use it and how to scan a hard-copy COVID certificate.\nIn the app, the required COVID certificate can be selected, and presented if desired. The app shows the time of your vaccination or test and how long ago you had the vaccination or test. All data contained in a certificate's QR code can also be displayed.\n\nIt is possible to store several COVID certificates in the app, e.g. for family members, or several COVID test certificates.\n\nUse of the COVID Certificate app is voluntary and free of charge.\n\nData protection is a top priority\n\nCOVID certificate data is stored solely on the mobile device. COVID certificates are protected by a digital seal (signature) and are thus forgery-proof.\nCOVID certificates are generated by the FOITT, but are not stored in a central system. That is why it is not possible to obtain a copy of an issued certificate.\n\nThe use of the app is limited to Switzerland and is subject to Swiss law."

Powered by nature and innovative technology that personalizes your daily experience while keeping you in control of your cycle data.\n\n\nPainful Periods Aren't Natural\n\n\nBut they are common.

Each phase brings changes to the brain and body. Exercising and eating based on your cycle means changing the types of movements and nutrients during each phase to optimize your physique, hormones, and mood. 28 empowers you with simplified science, breathtaking content, and cutting-edge technology. \n\nBecome the Expert of You\n\n\nYou are a mystery. Your body doesn’t have to be. We’ve been locked in the passenger seats of our own bodies for far too long.

We're proud to have one of the strongest privacy policies in all of tech, which includes a steadfast commitment to never sell user cycle data to anyone for any reason and to never turn over user cycle data to any government or regulatory authority under any circumstance. We've intentionally built our algorithm to be manually controlled by the user at any time, as opposed to leveraging more invasive, machine learning methods. The only cycle data we currently collect is provided voluntarily by the user. It is also never shared with any existing or future investors. It is strictly confidential and used only for the purposes of providing a customized user experience. Any cycle data the user provides now or in the future can be changed or deleted by the user at any time. We do not store deleted cycle data. Once the user deletes that information, it is gone forever.\n\nEmbrace your nature and begin today!"

      "label": "Joggo is a running training app that helps people reach their running goals. Whether you want to: \n\n- Cross a specific distance or pace target\n- Manage your weight \n- Relax your mind\n\n\nThe Joggo app is built on 3 main pillars: Personalized Training, Education, and Motivation. Each pillar represents a set of features in our app that helps people achieve even the most ambitious goals.\n\n\nPersonalized training plans from beginners to pros: \nEvery user is asked to fill a quiz used to determine the underlying motivation for starting to run, the risk factors one might have, and personal goals. We then ask the user to have the first free run, which we track to determine actual fitness level and running capabilities, set the starting mark, and create a personalized training plan.\n\n\nBi-weekly running plan adjustments based on progress and feedback\nEven if the starting point is the same, two people will have very different progress in just two weeks. We acknowledge the differences and create a running program based on 2 weeks’ running streaks. Afterward, we re-evaluate your progress and feedback on your well-being. If you believe you can accomplish more, we then increase the intensity for the following 2 weeks’ running streaks. It is important to monitor your progress but not overdo it. \n\n\nTimely educational bits – right knowledge at the right time\nToo much information could be overwhelming, especially in the beginning. The right information at the right time could be a factor that determines if you continue running or burn yourself out and quit  altogether. Our focus is to give timely bits of information right when you need it the most. As you progress, our content will progress with you to cover more advanced topics and get gradually grounded into the intricacies of running, sports, health, and nutrition.\n\n\nGet rewarded for the effort and level up\nWe want to let you know that you are doing a great job. Despite the speed, distance, body shape, or gear – you are on the right track if you are running. Every run is rewarded with points that allow you to compare your effort with someone else and see how well you are doing. \n\n\nWith an additional purchase:\nConsultation Bundle: Get personal consultations with our elite running coaches and top nutritionists. Whether you need a coach to run better or a nutritionist to guide you toward a healthier life, our experts will be right here to support and help you keep going.\n\nWorkout Plan: Get a full-body workout guide with video tutorials and detailed instructions for your lower, upper body, and core. Created by our top sports specialists, this exercise plan is a “roadmap” that identifies the steps you need to take to reach your desired destination.\n\nJoggo works with Apple Health to sync workouts data.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Please seek a doctor’s advice in addition to using this app and before making any medical decisions.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://joggo.run/en/data-protection-policy/\nGeneral conditions: https://joggo.run/en/general-conditions"

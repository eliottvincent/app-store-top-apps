      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Hypnotize yourself to relieve pain and stress, improve your sleep, and build better habits. Reveri's self-hypnosis can help you anywhere in just a few minutes. \n\nBACKED BY SCIENCE\n\nDr. David Spiegel, Associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine, is a psychiatrist who has taught more than 7,000 people how to better manage their minds and bodies using hypnosis. David is also Reveri's Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, bringing more than 45 years of clinical and research experience studying stress, pain, sleep, and hypnosis. He has written thirteen books, 404 scientific journal articles, and 170 book chapters. He was educated at Harvard and Yale and now teaches at Stanford. He created Reveri so that you can tap his expertise, change your mind and mind your body.\n\nCHANGE YOUR MIND\n\nUse your mind to better control your body. Reveri's focused self-hypnosis sessions cover a range of challenges like insomnia, stress, focus, pain perception, eating habits, and quitting smoking.\n\n\nWHAT IS SELF-HYPNOSIS?\n\nIn plain terms, self-hypnosis is just a naturally occurring state of highly focused attention.\n\nHave you ever gotten so caught up in a good movie or a play or a novel that you think you're in the fictional world and forget about the world around you?\n\nThat's what self-hypnosis is like.\n\nWhen you use a telephoto lens or pinch to zoom way in on a picture on your phone - you get to see incredible detail of a very specific area, but you become less aware of the surrounding context.\n\nThat's what self-hypnosis is like.\n\nMany people fear that hypnosis is a loss of control. In reality, hypnosis is a means of increasing your control over your mind and body. Our minds are powerful tools, and most of us can learn how to use them more effectively. Hypnosis gives us a pathway to alter the relationship between mind and body.\n\nREVERI MEMBERSHIP\n\nPaying Reveri members will receive:\n- Access to the complete Reveri experience\n- Self-hypnosis sessions for quitting smoking, eating well, managing pain, relieving stress, improving sleep, enhancing focus\n- Short sessions that can be used frequently to help build the concentration muscle\n\nPrices are for customers in this country. Pricing in other countries may vary and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on your country of residence.\n\nYour iTunes account will be charged at confirmation of purchase for the entire term of the plan you choose. The subscription will automatically renew unless turned off in your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the current period ends. You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings after purchase. Our 1-month and 1-year subscription plans renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Refunds will not be provided for any unused portion of a subscription term.\n\nReveri teaches the self-hypnosis skill. Nothing in the Reveri App should be considered medical advice. Users seeking medical advice should consult with their doctor or other medical professionals. Reveri does not consider the Reveri app a prescriptive device, given that there are no misleading or false medical claims in the accompanying promotional literature. Reveri provides adequate directions for lay use. The hypnosis exercises recordings labeled only for behavior modification, self-improvement, habit correction, learning technique and simple relaxation are not considered to be devices unless they are also labeled for medical or therapeutic use, per Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 335.300 Hypnotherapy Devices -Self Hypnotic Tape Recordings last revised on 08/28/12.\n\nRead our terms and conditions here:  https://www.reveri.com/terms-of-service\nRead our privacy policy here:  https://www.reveri.com/privacy-policy"

Powered by nature and innovative technology that personalizes your daily experience while keeping you in control of your cycle data.\n\n\nPainful Periods Aren't Natural\n\n\nBut they are common.

Each phase brings changes to the brain and body. Exercising and eating based on your cycle means changing the types of movements and nutrients during each phase to optimize your physique, hormones, and mood. 28 empowers you with simplified science, breathtaking content, and cutting-edge technology. \n\nBecome the Expert of You\n\n\nYou are a mystery. Your body doesn’t have to be. We’ve been locked in the passenger seats of our own bodies for far too long. School taught us little-to-nothing about how our cycles and hormones actually work. 28 empowers you to connect with your body by understanding the beautifully complex nature of your biology, one day at a time.\n\n\n\nFEATURES: \n\nFollow Your Cycle\n  - Daily Cycle Status\n  - Easily Track Your Periods\n  - Phase Progress Bar \n\nScience-based Insights\n  - Daily body predictions\n  - Daily emotional predictions\n  - Goals, Guidance, and inspiration\n\nExercise Videos\n  - Personalized to match your energy and mood\n  - Designed by trainers of iconic supermodels\n  - Lengthen, strengthen, stretch & tone\n  - Sculpt booty, tighten abs, tone arms, lean legs\n  - Workout anywhere, at any time\n  - No equipment required\n  - Lightening-fast, high-definition streaming\n  - View on mobile, desktop, tablet, TV\n\nNutrition Profiles\n  - Daily nutrition guidelines for hormone balancing\n  - Specific suggestions by food groups \n  - Give your body what it needs, when it needs it\n  - No more calorie counting\n  - Coming Soon: Meal plans\n  - Coming soon: Shopping lists\n\nUser Privacy Is Our #1 Priority\n\nMany women have valid concerns regarding the privacy and safety of their personal health data. We're proud to have one of the strongest privacy policies in all of tech, which includes a steadfast commitment to never sell user cycle data to anyone for any reason and to never turn over user cycle data to any government or regulatory authority under any circumstance. We've intentionally built our algorithm to be manually controlled by the user at any time, as opposed to leveraging more invasive, machine learning methods. The only cycle data we currently collect is provided voluntarily by the user. It is also never shared with any existing or future investors. It is strictly confidential and used only for the purposes of providing a customized user experience. Any cycle data the user provides now or in the future can be changed or deleted by the user at any time. We do not store deleted cycle data. Once the user deletes that information, it is gone forever.\n\nEmbrace your nature and begin today!"

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

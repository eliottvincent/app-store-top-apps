      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Fresh look, elastic skin and chiseled chin - all of these you'll have without spending money on face injections. The youthful glow of health can be yours with just daily gymnastics for your facial muscles!\n\nFace Yoga – Facial exercises is the most effective anti-aging tool to help improve facial muscle tone. Face exercises prevent wrinkles by increasing the blood circulation. Face yoga is based on the principle that facial muscles are trainable, just like body muscles. If you don't train your body muscles, they become weak and flabby, and the same thing happens to your facial muscles as you age.\n\nWHAT BENEFITS ARE THERE TO DOING FACIAL EXERCISES?\nA young, beautiful face is not only good skin without wrinkles. The youthfulness is evidenced by chiseled cheekbones, a beautiful chin line, and the absence of nasolabial \"creases\". Strengthening the muscles will widen the eyes, lift the cheeks and corners of the lips, and strengthen the chin line, while accelerated blood circulation will make the skin firmer and tighter. In addition, by putting weak and sagging muscles back in place, you can also get rid of wrinkles and prevent them from appearing in the future.\n\nThe benefits of doing facial exercises or yoga for the face go beyond just making you look younger. Facial toning can also help with reducing wrinkles, firming muscles in different areas on your body (such as neck area), improving eye strain relief and confidence! Facial workouts are an excellent way not only to get rid of inches from sagging skin but also control what's happening underneath that soften over time - which could lead up towards serious health conditions.\n\nALL YOU NEED TO START FACE BUILDING, YOU CAN FIND IN OUR APP FACE YOGA – FACIAL EXERCISES:\n- different programs of the face yoga;\n- video guide explaining the right technique of each face exercise;\n- every day a new step of face workout to achieve the goal.\n\nThere are many reasons why people would be interested in practicing face exercises. Some say that it's just good common sense, while others claim their classes provide an alternative cost-effective solution for those who can't afford expensive cosmetic surgery or costly injections of botox into the face skin. In recent years there has been a growing trend among yoga practitioners towards doing \"facial workout\" which includes various types. Face Yoga is one such example where you work out different muscle groups throughout this area using moves like touching fingertips together at nose level then moving them apart slowly until arm movement ceases completely.\n\nThe beauty benefits of face yoga are endless. It can help you get a younger appearance and reduce signs of ageing, like wrinkles! Face Yoga – Facial exercises will make you look younger so do them every day!\n\nTerms of use: https://inapplab.com/app/22/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://inapplab.com/app/22/privacy-policy"

      "label": "You don’t need any special medical equipment to get your pulse and to keep track of your health state, just your phone camera! Most accurate, fast and easy to use heart rate app.\n \nAPPLIED METHOD:\n\nOur app is based on photoplethysmography (PPG), non-invasive optical technique. Each heart beat transmits the amount of blood to the tissues in your fingers, while the blood absorbs your camera’s light, it illuminates the skin and captures microvascular blood volume changes such as ebb and flow. That allows you to measure the pulse easily, accurately and efficiently.\n \nHOW TO USE:\n\nCover the camera lens and flashlight with your fingertip completely. Do not press too intensively in order to avoid reducing blood flow. Hold your phone steady and keep still. Make sure your fingers are not cold. Press the button and get your results.\n \nTRACK YOUR MEASUREMENTS:\n\nGet visual display of the data at the given period of time. Personal dashboard with your measurement history.\n \nHEALTH KIT INTEGRATION:\n\nSupport for sharing heart rate results with Apple Health App.\n \nREMINDER:\n\nReceive notifications in order to have your finger on the pulse. Staying healthy and fit is a systematic process.\n \nIMPROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE:\nTrack your workout effectiveness to get in shape, improve your endurance and general wellness.\n \nNEVER MISS A BEAT!\n \nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n \nYearly subscription with 3-day free trial period will give you full access to \n* Unlimited measurements per day, \n* Monthly statistics,\n* Health insights, \n* No ads.\n \nDisclaimer: App measurements are just recommendations and can’t be used for diagnostics or medical purpose. Always seek a doctor's advice before making any medical decisions.\n\nPlease note that the app doesn't measure blood pressure, oxygen levels and body temperature, you can only record and keep measurement indexs! You need a thermometer, a tonometer and a pulse oximeter to measure values. Save your measurements in \"Heart Rate\".\n \nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\n \nSubscriptions may be managed by you and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to iTunes Account Settings. For more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Unused portion of a free-trial period will be forfeited when a user decides to subscribe.\n \nTerms: http://codabrasoft.com/Terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: http://codabrasoft.com/Privacy.html"

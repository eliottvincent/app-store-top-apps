      "label": "This is the free version.\n\n* With this app you don´t need to know how to read sheet music to learn how to play Guitar. You simply watch the animations on each lesson and play the same by imitation on your own guitar.\n\nThe numbers of the circles on the  guitar fretboard represent the fingers of your left hand.\r\rYou will see animations of the beats, the notes on the stave, and what you need to do with the fingers of your left hand on the Guitar.\n\nIt includes seventy lessons on the following contemporary music styles:\n\n- Rock (15)\n- Blues (15)\n- Jazz (5)\n- Funk (15)\n- Latin Music (15)\n- Fusion (5)\r\r\n\nOn each lesson there are four buttons:\n\n\r\r* With button \"a\" you can listen to whole band.\n\n\r\r* With button \"b\" you will listen your instrument at slow speed. Use this section to learn the pattern.\r\r\n\n* With button \"c\" you can listen your instrument at normal speed.\r\r\n\n* With button \"d\" you will listen just the other instruments. You have to integrate the Guitar part to the ensemble. No more animations. Audio repeats without stopping so you can practice until you reach the normal speed. You can improvise on the pattern, which is repeated over and \rover.\n\n\r\r* While practicing with buttons \"a\", \"b\" y \"c\", you can click on any bar from which you want to repeat.\r\r\n\n* The sheet music and the animations of the notes on the staff are presented to let you see that there is a very close relation between what is played on the Guitar and how music is written and read. This helps on understanding the basis of reading music in an intuitive way. YOU DON´T NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE WRITTEN MUSIC IF YOU DON´T WANT TO.\r\r\n\n* The easiest style to begin with is ROCK.\r\r\n\n* The Guitar is shown in the same way you see a person playing in front of you.\n\n\r\r* These Guitar patterns are some of the most used musical phrases on ROCK, BLUES, JAZZ, FUNK, LATIN MUSIC & FUSION. Learning to play these patterns will   give you a pretty good idea on how to play these styles.\n\nStart playing Rock, Blues, Jazz, Latin Music and other contemporary styles on Guitar. While you play the lessons you will intuitively understand how to read music. Guitar lessons are fun with this app.\n\nPlaying the Electric Guitar or the Acoustic Guitar can really be easy if it´s done in the right way. With this app you don´t need to know how to read music. It shows you through animations what you have do with your fingers. You don´t have to know guitar chords. You don´t have to know guitar scales. \n\nThere are several types of guitars: acoustic guitar or electric guitar, Spanish guitar or classical guitar. There are different guitar brands: Fender, Gibson, Ibanez and many more. All of them have the same music notes. So you can use this app for any type of guitar or any guitar brand.\n\nIf you are taking guitar lessons and you want to play guitar songs you should use this app. It is made for those who want to learn guitar.\r\rHAVE FUN!!!"

      "label": "This is the free version.\n\nIt includes:\n\nGUITAR NOTES SECTION on which you can click on any string and fret on the virtual guitar fretboard to see the corresponding note on the staff, its name and its pitch.\n\nThis section includes exercises on which notes appear on the staff and you have to click on the string and the fret corresponding to each particular note. This helps on being able to see a written note and relate it with the guitar fretboard or seeing an specific fretboard position and knowing which one is the corresponding note on the staff.\n\nThere are exercises without time limit to click and there are exercises with time limit to increase the speed to respond.\n\nLESSONS SECTION (Seventy lessons):\n\nThese lessons show the way in which the GUITAR is written in different styles of contemporary music.\n- Rock Pop\n- Blues Rock\n- Jazz\n- Funk\n- Latin Music\n- Fusion \n\nOn each lesson you will see a sheet music and you will listen what is written on it. You will see animations of the beats, the notes on the staff and the numbers of the fingers of the left hand on the guitar fretboard. This allows you to relate what is written on a score with that which is played on the GUITAR.\n\nBy clicking the \"a\" button you will listen all the instruments. By clicking the \"b\" button you will only listen the GUITAR at slow speed. By clicking on button “c” you will listen the guitar at normal speed. You can click on the bar from which you want to repeat.\n\nQUIZZES SECTION (Seventy quizzes):\n\nEach Quiz is related to a lesson. There are no more animations of the beats, nor the notes on the staff, nor the fingers on the guitar fretboard.\n\nYou have to click on a button at the moment when you hear each one of the notes or silences marked in red on the sheet music. This helps to speed up rhythmic reading in real time.\n\nSIGHT READING EXERCISES\n(30 exercises):\n\nThese exercises will help you to develop the ability to relate that which is written in a sheet music with the strings and frets on a GUITAR, in real time.\n\nWhen the exercise begins you have to click on each string and fret that corresponds to that which is written. This has to be done at first sight in real time.\n\nIn the same way as reading guitar music, flute music, violin music or bass music, all require practice; reading GUITAR becomes easier if you practice it on a daily basis. \n\nKnowing how to read music is very useful if you get GUITAR lessons. Being able to understand a music score helps you to get a better understanding of any type of GUITAR music styles. Practicing is the key and this app has been created to let you practice reading GUITAR sheet music anywhere at anytime."

You have to integrate your part to the ensemble.\n\n- While practicing you can click on the bar from which you want to repeat.\n\nClick on the icon of the instrument you want to practice, at the bottom of the main page, to find out how to study each lesson.\n\nThe best way to approach these materials is to have a band with your friends and together practice each of the 30 lessons that this app presents. Once you have worked through the 30 lessons, you can download the app for each instrument that contains 40 additional lessons (70 in total). Just click the blue arrow icon on the main page to download the app for your favorite instrument.\n\nIf you don't have someone to play with in a band, each lesson has a “d” section where you listen to the other instruments while you play your own part. This gives you the experience of playing within an ensemble, whether you play Guitar, Piano/Keyboards, Bass, or Drums.\n\nThis app is useful not only for those who want to play in a band, but also for those who want to know what makes a musical style sound like it. What does a bass player have to do for something to sound like Blues or like Latin Music. What are the main rhythmic characteristics of Funk or Rock. What should a drummer do when asked to play a Blues rhythm or a Cha cha chá. How the guitar and piano/keyboard should interact, and so on. These are fundamental aspects for any musician, be it a performer, an arranger or a songwriter. The exercises in this app will help to have a clear idea of the aforementioned aspects.\n\nThe most common elements in each style are used and they are presented in ascending order in terms of their degree of difficulty."

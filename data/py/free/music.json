Listen to the full page or note by note, loop phrases, even isolate the treble or bass clef. We welcome your participation and suggestions. Enjoy!  \n\nKey features:\n• Select a composition from our growing library, and play along instantly, interacting with the musical score.\n• If you play a concert band instrument, play your part while hearing and following along with the full band composition in a piano version\n• Or take a picture of a page of music and MusicPal will process the photo, enabling you to hear what you see.\n\nEasy-to-use:\n• Tap music clefs to mute and unmute staves: hear the right hand part while playing the left hand part, and vice versa.\n• Press play to hear and follow along with the music.\n• Tap to hear any note or chord.\n• Tap and drag to listen to a selection.\n• Pinch to zoom in and out.\n• Change playback tempo and transposition level.\n• Tap music clefs to mute and unmute staves: hear the right hand part while playing the left hand part, and vice versa.\n• Use the toolbar buttons to loop a passage, or go note by note.\n\nPhotos are supported for keyboard music (two staves) and monophonic instrumental music (one staff). Successful photo results depend on the quality, completeness, and simplicity of the musical score image. MusicPal is designed to take pictures of conventional Western sheet music notation that is printed on paper. MusicPal will not properly photograph guitar tab, handwritten music, vocal music with lyrics, music with specialized notations, or sheet music displayed on laptop and mobile screens.\n\nA MusicPal monthly auto-renewing subscription allows you full access to premium features:\n\n• Complete MusicPal score library\n• Unlimited number of OMR captures\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Your monthly subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.

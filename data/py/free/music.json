      "label": "EON Connect is a smart device application for control of up to four JBL EON 600-series speakers, using EON 600’s built-in Bluetooth functionality. The EON Connect app enables you to optimize the performance of each speaker through exclusive access to additional DSP parameters, including three fully adjustable parametric equalizers, plus  Hi and Lo Shelf filters. In addition you can set speaker delay for compensating speaker positions and control output mixing. Plus, quickly apply speaker settings across other EON 600-series speakers through preset creation and recall. You can also update each speaker’s firmware to the latest version directly from the EON Connect application. \n\nJBL engineers purposely designed the JBL EON 600 speaker line to provide a fully professional, easy to use, and built-to-last portable loudspeaker system for today’s working musicians and sound providers. Featuring JBL’s advanced waveguide technology, JBL designed and manufactured transducers, the latest technologies in cabinet materials and wireless DSP control via Bluetooth, the JBL EON 600-series delivers the extraordinary quality of a high-end studio monitor in a powerful portable PA.\n\nNOTE: Due to improvements in the application infrastructure, users of the app before version 1.34 may need to create new settings. Version 2.0 is built on a new, improved code base for better performance. Users should reset their EON Speakers before using this version of the app. If a speaker is still linked to the old app, it may not be able to connect to the new app."

Use the familiar pinch and swipe gestures to zoom right in and fiddle with fine detail, or step back to see the big picture. Select pieces of audio. Live \"scrubbing\" means you can hear the sound under your fingertip as you make your adjustments. And you needn't fear a bad edit with our full undo/redo support — even after closing your project.\n\nHokusai comes free with a set of useful tools such as fade in/out, normalise volume levels, reverse time, and basic synthesis. If you need more power, you can upgrade from inside the app to add new tools and effects, including: Per-track volume/mute/panning, selecting across multiple tracks at once, presets and favourites, grain synthesis, noise gating, time-stretching, pitch-bending, echo, reverb, modulation (AM & FM), resonance, distortion, grunge, vocal levelling, monster voice, high/low/band-pass/notch-cut filter and more — many of which can be previewed live."

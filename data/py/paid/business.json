Thanks for a solid app!\"\n\n\"Nice, clean app for transferring files and updating HTML and CSS. The editor is nice and easy to use, common symbols very quickly accessed.

But the benefit is considerable. No longer tethered to your laptop, you can move around the room while still holding in your hand an image of what’s on the screen behind you. No more of that weird over-the-shoulder karaoke move when checking to see where you are in the presentation.\"\n\nGo to your next PowerPoint presentation IN STYLE with i-Clickr Remote for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch!\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Complete control of your PowerPoint presentation including animations.\n* Record your presentation (slides and your voice audio) into a movie as you present.\n* Share PDF version of the presentation with audience via E-Mail.\n* View your slides AND slide notes directly on your iOS device during your presentation.\n* Navigate through your slides with finger swipes and taps.\n* Grab your audience's attention with real-time annotations (Windows only).\n* Help you track your presentation time with onboard clock.\n* Set presentation alarm so that your iOS device will alert you with a silent buzz before your time runs out.\n* Pause and resume presentations.\n* Switch between multiple slideshow.\n* Work with both Windows and Mac Office (see below for the Office versions supported), iWork '09 Keynote on Mac, and OpenOffice on Windows.\n* Easy to set up with zero configuration.\n* No additional cost when using with multiple host computers.\n* NEW: Control presentation from your Apple Watch.\n* NEW: Control external laser pointer.\n\nRequirement:\n\n* On Windows, support all versions of Microsoft PowerPoint (the free Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer is not supported).  Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows (version XP or above) is required at the host PC. \n* On Mac OS X, Office Mac 2004 or above, or iWork '09 Keynote is required.\n* WiFi connection between the host computer and your device, or connection using direct ad hoc network and the iOS’s personal hotspot.  \n* Also support the FREE OpenOffice 3.1 on Windows.\n\nTo download software required at your host computer (that is, the PC/Mac that will run your PowerPoint presentation), visit http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/iClickr/Download.aspx\n\n*** If you have problem getting i-Clickr to work, please contact us at support@senstic.com, and we will help you fix the problem."

      "label": "5 Stars. “I can't tell you how often I use it, probably about as much as the phone app!\" \n- CharlieW, President. Waterman & Company (Real Estate Investment and Development)\n\n“This is the first 12C type calculator for the itouch that has actually made me put down my real 12C. One of the best features of this calculator is the register display where you can see what is in FV, I, PV, PMT, etc. That alone makes it worth the $14.95 price. Consider the many other features that it has over and above the real 12C and you have one sweet program here. Best of the 12C emulators out there - hands down! “\n- tsinvest\n\nIt started in early 2008 with a belief that:\n • there was one and only one insanely great financial calculator\n • the iPhone is the perfect platform to bring that calculator back to life\n • it's not good enough to just copy the old, you have to make it better\n • a financial calculator is a professional tool, not a game\n \nFrom this mindset came Calc-12E, the first 12C emulator on the App Store. It was expensive back then ($20-$25) and compared to a game it still is because, well, you usually get what you pay for. Specifically:\n\nForemost, if the math isn't right in the corner cases I can't trust the calculator. Calc-12E's algorithms were written for iOS by a (the?) key member of the original 12C development team who incorporated his solutions to the quirks in financial computation that historically tripped up lesser implementations. There are reasons the 12C was the absolute best, and Calc-12E draws directly on that heritage.\n \nWhile the original did what it could, 1980s technology made many features difficult, impractical or impossible to use. Calc-12E pioneered the following innovations to address shortcomings:\n    • you can always see what's in the financial registers (and stack if you choose) so you have instant assurance that you've entered your data correctly. This feature has been copied by nearly every emulator on the App Store, for good reason.\n    • visual cash flow editing radically eases how you deal with cash flows... believe it or not it is actually easy to manipulate cash flows with Calc-12E. There's a demo on YouTube, search for Calc12E.\n    • Investment mode allows you to simultaneously evaluate metrics on up to three cash flow scenarios at a time. You can compare cash flows side-by-side AND because of visual cash flow editing you can play what-if games\n    • the results of some calculations need to \"leave the phone\" to be useful. Amortization schedules, leasing terms, bond yields... everything can be sent via email using customizable templates\n    \nFinally, a professional tool receives continuing support and updates. It does not nag you to rate it, it does not invite you to pay to get more. It does not crash. Check out Calc-12E's version history and reviews of previous versions. This is a live, supported app with tens of thousands of long term customers and I have never charged for an upgrade or cloaked features behind ads or paywalls. It's not ethical at this level (in my humble opinion!).\n\nWhen you buy Calc-12E you get my best (and evolving!) rendition of the most popular handheld calculator ever made. It's core (the math) comes from the same mind as your trusty original and to that foundation you get usability advances that actually enhance the overall tool."

      "label": "A Bíblia King James de 1611 é descrita como uma das publicações mais importantes da história, e também a mais fiel ao Textus Receptus. O rei James I da Inglaterra reuniu os maiores estudiosos religiosos e linguistas para uma nova tradução da Bíblia, a fim de estabelecer a tradução mais precisa e mais digna até à data. Ele nomeou 54 estudiosos para trabalhar na tradução, e 47 trabalharam em seis grupos em três locais por sete anos.\r\n\r\nApós a conclusão, a Bíblia King James foi impressa pela primeira vez em 1611 por Robert Barker. A Bíblia era muito grande, cerca de 40cm de altura. Por causa do alto custo e valor, foi anunciado para as igrejas que a Bíblia devia ser acorrentada nos púlpitos.\r\n\r\nA Bíblia 1611 foi autorizada para ser lida nas igrejas, razão pela qual foi chamada de Versão Autorizada. Enfim, nós da BV Books estamos felizes em poder apresentar, a Versão Autorizada em português da Bíblia King James."

      "label": "Nano Enterprise Management is a simple, yet powerful application for small and medium-sized businesses that helps you efficiently oversee purchases, sales, production, warehouses, and finances right from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch – and all without internet access or any special skills. There is also a desktop version of the app that is fully compatible with the mobile version.\nIn multi-user mode, you can locate the database on the Web hosting and connect to it all your users. To differentiate the users’ permissions in the application, the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented.\n\nThe application's primary purpose is to efficiently manage purchases and product sales for small companies. Nano Enterprise Management is also an excellent fit for any firm that provides services (auto mechanics, hair salons, etc.) or does basic production (assembling computers, crafting furniture, etc.). Thanks to its precise modular structure, all changes in one module are instantly reflected in the others. You can also take advantage of the easy-to-use configuration tool to flexibly adjust settings for various attributes (for example, new products arriving to a warehouse will instantly become available to be ordered while factoring in characteristics such as color, size, material, etc.). The special service planner allows you to flexibly manage resources, personnel, and workstations on the basis of actual load. For example, you could distribute incoming orders to various technicians based on their work schedules, rates, and specializations. All information is visible in real time, so at any time you can check how many orders are currently being processed, how many payments have come in from customers, how much stock is remaining in the warehouse, and how much cash the company has on hand. Deposits and withdrawals have been simplified to the highest degree possible, so even an inexperienced user can easily make sense of them.\n\nAnother major advantage is the attractive, elegant reports with flexible filters that allow you to instantly create excerpts based on the exact time period and data you need at a given moment. The most important information is collected in the \"Marginal Revenue\" report, where you can view your total profits for a selected time interval broken up by region, customer, store, or other factors.\n\nAnd, finally, Nano Enterprise Management stores all data locally (no internet access required), supports data transfer between tablets, and can create backup copies and manage them via email, iCloud, or Dropbox. If you frequently work on a computer or laptop, just install the desktop version of the application (for MacOS), which has the same features as the mobile version.\n\nMoreover, the application is provided along with a tutorial database for your convenience. As soon as you learn your way around the application you can feel free to delete the test data and upload your own.\n\nQuestions?\nPlease email us for help or to give suggestions. We love to hear how businesses are using our app!\n\nE-mail: erziman@gmail.com"

      "label": "Nano Hotel Booking - is an application for receiving orders and booking rooms in hotels, recreation centers, health centers, guesthouses. \nAlso, it can be used for daily, hourly, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly renting of real estate, vehicles, construction machinery and any other objects. Application’s versatility makes it suitable for services reservation, for example, at hair salons, car workshops, gyms etc. \n\nThe application is fully compatible with the desktop version (Nano Hotel Booking for OS X).\n\nPrinciples of operation\nThe application is based on a calendar registering the statuses of the hotel rooms (objects). The calendar displays the state of a hotel room on any day of the month. In the hourly rent mode there is a separate calendar for one day divided into 5, 10, 15, 30 or 60 minutes. \nBooked days are highlighted with pink color. For each free day, the room rate is given with regard to seasonal prices. \nTo book a room you need to create an order for this room while specifying the term and the type of a rent. An order can be tied to the client book, or you can simply enter client’s name and phone number directly to the order card. \nYou can book a free room straightforward from the calendar. You can open an order card or a room card from the calendar with one click. Rooms can be made unavailable, for example, for the period of renovation. Rooms and orders can also be labeled with colored tags in order to show their current status.\n\nPricing\nIn a room (object) card you can specify the price and the cost of one day of rent. If you have a lot of rooms, it will be more convenient to create price lists in the settings and tie rooms to them. \nYou can specify daily, hourly, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly prices in the price lists separately. \nYou can enter season prices for each room. Season prices can be tied to the price lists. \nIt is possible to add additional options to each order, such as food, excursions, transfers. There is an indication of each option’s price, as well as whether the price depends on the number of days and the number of guests. \nAn account of the room appliances is kept, i.e. refrigerator, TV, telephone set and so forth.\n\nTypes of rent\n\nDaily\nThis is the main mode of the application. The value of an order is calculated as the price per day multiplied by the number of days or nights, depending on the application settings (see “Settings” – “My Profile”).\n\nHourly\nThe value of an order is calculated as the price per hour multiplied by the number of hours of rent (can be specified accurately to within 5 minutes).\n\nWeekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly\nIn these modes (cyclic orders), the value is calculated as the price per one period (week, month, quarter or year) multiplied by the number of periods that have begun. Let us demonstrate you this through an example. Let’s say the monthly rent is 100 and let’s say today is June 30th. Let’s create an order from July 1st to August 31st with a monthly rent type. In this example, the order amount on June 30th will be 0, as the rent starts only since tomorrow. The order amount on July 1st will be 100. On August 1st the order amount will increase by 100 and will equal 200. On September 1st the amount will not change, as the order ends on August 31st. \nYou can stop a cyclic order at any moment. For this purpose, there is a button “Close cyclic order” in an order card. It will set the order amount equal to the sum of money actually received and the end date to the day of an order closure. \n\nIn all types of rent, the value of options is added to the order amount."

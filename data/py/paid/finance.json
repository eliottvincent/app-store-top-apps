Professional! Highly Recommended... finally the currency application I have been waiting for so long...\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"...I tried all other similar apps, and I am proud to announce that this app is simply the best of them all..\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Smart, intuitive and flexible!... slick interface with great functionality which further impresses with its great selection of currencies and immediate updates. Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

This will help you to keep focus on specific areas when working on a task or experiment. Also, it will be easier to see which parts of your business you are moving forward and what it's being left behind.  \n\nDESIGN A BETTER BUSINESS MODEL:\n\nAdd your \"sticky notes\" to the business model canvas and benefit from automatic charts that will provide better visuals for showcasing your business ideas to others.\n\nEVALUATE KEY METRICS:\n\nThe built-in Customer Lifetime Value Simulator helps to understand the value of your customers and how much you can spend on customer acquisition to be sustainable. \n\nYou can also generate Profit & Loss projections painlessly from you business model data to make a long term analysis of your margins.\n\nGET READY FOR ACTION:\n\nAchieve you most Important goals with the powerful OKR - Objectives and Key Results methodology, used by fast growing startups and companies.\n\nEXECUTE, THE AGILE WAY:\n\nCreate lists of tasks to move your business forward or experiments to validate you business model assumptions.

The program requires a minimum of time for keeping records; it is easy enough for novices, while it provides rich functionality and a lot of settings for experienced users.\n\nOne base on different devices.

You can log in to the app using other devices or via WEB-interface (browser), following the link “http://walletsapp.com”.\n\nForget about past problems of unknown losses and counting money for a long time. Now you have a reliable program that will help you:\n- Reduce your expenses;\n- Calculate the total capital in different currencies;\n- Save your family budget;\n- Assess your financial possibilities;\n\nAs our ancestors used to say, money likes to be counted!

Every month he would spend and spend and eventually his income would run out, without saving a dime.\n \n “I want to save more money!” He thought to himself. So he set out to turn his financial life around.\n \n To his luck, he found an app called Spentable. An app that allowed him to use the notification center to quickly add expenses to a predefined category. No typing, just choose a category, input a number, and press enter, all from the notification center.\n \n Steven soon saved up enough money to get himself an Apple Watch, which he used to enter his expenses through the Apple Watch Spentable app. He simply lifted his wrist, and in one single tap, he was in.

      "label": "Account Book is an app which helps you to control your finances. Who doesn't know that feeling of having less and less money in your account at the end of the month eventhough you haven't bought anything special? This is where keeping a household account book comes in handy. But how many actually do this? Sitting down every day and detailing your exact spending only to find that at the end of the month your bank account still shows the same deficit as before. \n\nThis app will help you to order your finances in an easy way. Due to the clear and simple layout, you can enter your daily expenses and incomes in only a few seconds. \n\nInitially, it is advisable to enter your monthly fixed costs (e.g. rent) and income (e.g. salary) to have them calculated as a flat rate by this clever app. This way you don't have to deduct your rent every month or add your salary...but rather this is done for you automatically. This app can automatically deduct or add a fixed amount monthly or annually, so you are spared a lot of work. \n\nSimply enter your flexible expenses each time and add a short commentary if you like. So if, for example, you go shopping simply enter that you spent € 20 at the shops. The date is then automatically added and your expense is booked. \n\nNext time you go shopping, you don't have to type in \"Shopping\" as this item will be suggested to you automatically. Simply add the amount you spent. \n\nOf course, this system works the other way round as well. When you have income, for example you sell your old television on Ebay and earn € 50, you can book that amount in just a few seconds and this way never lose overview of your finances. \n\nSo you don't lose the complete overview however, you can also have graphically displayed in which month you had a positive or negative balance. This way you can oversee the whole year and determine when you spent a lot and on what you spent your money on.  \n\nTo recognize in advance when it could become difficult at the end of a month again, it is displayed to you what percentage of the month still remains and how much money you have at your disposal. This way you know in advance, for example, that you still have half the month to go but only have € 200 to spend. Therefore, start saving! \n\nThis app is an investment which pays for itself on day one and turns into profit after that. \n\nAdditionally, it should be mentioned that studies have proven that people who use (household) account books handle their money more consciously and end up with more money at the end of the month than people who do not. This is mainly explained by those people asking themselves if they really need that € 2 packet of chewing gum or if it is simply a pointless expense which will haunt them at the end of the month."

Veja alguns exemplos:\n•Preciso financiar um produto de R$ 10.000,00 e a taxa de juros bancária é de 1,8% ao mês, mas posso pagar uma parcela de, no máximo, R$ 450,00. Em quantos meses terei que financiar o produto?\n•Recebi um prêmio de R$ 10.000,00 e quero aplicar em um investimento que rende 6% de juros ao ano e desejo, em 10 anos, ter um capital acumulado de R$ 250.000,00. Qual o valor dos depósitos mensais que precisarei fazer para obter esse valor?\n•Vou adquirir um imóvel de R$ 500.000,00, pela tabela SAC, para pagar em 240 meses a uma taxa de juros de 7,5% ao ano. Quais serão os valores de cada parcela?\n•O vendedor informou que o produto custa R$ 2.500,00 e que pagarei em 20 parcelas de R$ 150,00. Qual é a taxa de juros real que está sendo utilizada?\n\nOs relatórios exibidos poderão ser exportados em PDF ou em planilhas de cálculo, permitindo enviar essas informações por e-mail ou compartilhar com outros aplicativos.\n\nO “Juros” é muito fácil ser utilizado, mas, se você tiver dúvidas, no site da TR7 você encontrará um completo manual de utilização."

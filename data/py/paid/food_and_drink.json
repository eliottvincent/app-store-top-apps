      "label": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

Also remember to select the thickness of the edges and the bottom. A difference of a few millimetres will result in errors of several tens of grams.\n\n3 - Place the phone on the container.\n\n4 - Use your fingers to choose the diameter, making it match that of the container.\n\n5 - Place the phone next to the container and use your finger to choose the level of the measurement. If your phone has a cover, remove it, otherwise SUBTRACT the thickness of the cover from the thickness of the edge.\n\n6 - At this point you'll get the grams or millilitres if you are measuring a liquid.\n\nFor the first few times check the measurements, just to get started. Measurements made with this application are only approximate. They are quite precise, but they cannot be compared to measurements on scales."

In order to know what’s behind a “Lubina” on a Spanish menu, all you need is to whip out your iPhone.\n\nFOOD ENCYCLOPEDIA AND SHOPPING ASSISTANCE\nFor every entry, the App provides at least one photo, evaluates culinary quality and indicates the scientific name, if applicable. In the description, the most important and relevant culinary information is summarized all in one place, and is followed by hints to uses in cuisine and its processing and preparation – without the App actually intending to be a cookbook. \n\nTRANSLATION ASSISTANCE ABROAD\nTravelers mostly enjoy that all the food names are simultaneously given in five languages – English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. Thus, it is possible to translate menus abroad, to ask about a specific fish on a Spanish market or to look up whether Banon cheese from the cheese menu in a restaurant is made with raw milk or not. \n\nSEARCH BY KEYWORD OR CHAPTER\nThe Food Guide can be perused by individual ingredients, but is also organized into 21 categories such as “Fish”, “Vegetables and Legumes”, “Herbs and Seasonings”, “Cheese”, “Seafood” and “Sausages and Ham”, to name just a few.\n\nFAVORITES FUNCTION\nInteresting findings can be transferred into an App-specific favorites list with just the touch of a finger. That way, they can quickly be found again at any time.\n\nRUNS OFFLINE\nIt is not necessary to have an Internet or a telephone connection to run the App. You will always have full access to all of the information, regardless of whether you find yourself on the beach on the Bahamas, in a Spanish mountain village or in a delicatessen in Paris.\n \nFood Guide Features:\n• Extremely attractive, easy to use interface\n• Multilingual dictionary with 2,000 food products and ingredients\n• Each entry accompanied by at least one highres picture of the product\n• More than 2,500 high quality pictures\n• Scientific names included in descriptions\n• Offers product knowledge and consumer information\n• App has 21 comprehensive chapters\n• Shows 1-5 star rating of enjoyment level \n• Versatile search functions\n• ‘Favorites’ feature lets you bookmark products that you want to return to"

You won’t have to wait until future app updates—new recipes can now be added automatically to the app on your device!\n\n● More than 2,000 stunning, high-resolution photos showing every step of the cooking process.\n\n● Fun and visually-engaging new user interface and design, including a home display that allows you to quickly scroll through and visually select recipes.\n\n● Simple-to-follow instructions, including tips, shortcuts, and information about food and techniques.\n\n● An interactive, email-friendly grocery list that syncs across devices and makes food shopping a breeze.\n\n● An extensive “Paleo 101” primer that explains the benefits of the “caveman” diet and provides resources for more information about ancestral health and nutrition.\n\n● A Whole30-friendly 30-day sample meal plan with links to recipes.\n\n● An in-depth shopping guide with product reviews and links to sources for cooking tools and ingredients.\n\n● The ability to bookmark recipes, create a personalized category of favorite recipes, and add notes.\n\n● A “constant-on” function to prevent the screen from dimming while you cook.\n  \n● The ability to email complete recipes and shopping lists.\n\nPraise for Nom Nom Paleo:\n\n● The “Martha Stewart of Paleo.” –The New York Times\n\n● “Oddly provocative.” –Christopher Kimball of America’s Test Kitchen\n\n● “A must-have app.” –AppCraver\n\n● “Brilliantly designed.” –Apps Magazine\n \n● “Visually stunning.” –Gear Diary\n\n● “Always popping with flavor.” –The Kitchn\n\n● “Truly extraordinary.” –Michael Ruhlman, James Beard Award-winning food writer\n \nMessage from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:\n\nHey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!\n\nThis “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.\n \nBut that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.\n \nMy hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!\n \n● App development by Y Media Labs ●"

I would of paid 100 pounds for this had I know the contents before purchasing. I can tell LOADS of work has gone into this and you are sharing some amazing energy for little. Well well done.

I Love it :)\"\n- Jasmine Ogana\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe only thing that matters when it comes to diet plans is if it works!\n\nBased on over 20 years of research the Dukan Diet is one of the most popular books and diet plans in France. It is a protein-based diet designed by French nutritionist and dietician, Pierre Dukan.\n\nThe diet consists of 4 phases: attack, cruise, consolidation, and stabilization.\n\nThe attack phase is designed to enable dieters to rapidly lose 2 to 3 kilograms (4.4 to 6.6 lb) in 2–7 days by kick-starting their metabolism. Dieters are allowed to eat as much as they want of 72 protein-rich foods.\n\nThe cruise phase is designed to allow dieters to more gradually achieve the weight they aim for by eating protein-rich foods with the addition of 28 specific vegetables. \n\nThe consolidation phase is designed to help in preventing any future massive weight gain. During this phase, fruit, bread, cheese and starchy foods are reintroduced into a normal diet, leaving two celebratory meals a week as directed by the plan.\n\nFinally, in the stabilization phase, dieters can essentially eat whatever they want without gaining weight by following a few lifestyle rules: protein day once a week, eating oat bran every day and making a fitness commitment to \"take the stairs\". Dieters should follow this last phase for the rest of their life to avoid regaining weight.\n\n- Features an elegant and intuitive interface\n\n- Over 300 dukan food recipes\n\n- Recipes for all meal types including: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack\n\n- Star your favorites for easy reference\n\n- Filter menu to sort\n\n- Search feature to quickly find your favorite recipe\n\nDownload Dukan Diet Pro and start feeling healthier today!"

      "label": "Caveman Feast for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch contains 250 delicious Paleo recipes that are beautifully illustrated and easy to follow.\n\nThere's nothing really revolutionary about the Paleo diet. It's what our grandma's have been telling us for years: \"Eat real foods that are healthy, avoid highly processed factory foods and you'll feel better and live happier\".\n\nWhether you call it Paleo, real food, low carb, low sugar, grain-free, gluten-free ancestral, nutrient-dense, primal or whole food - the important thing is that the Paleo diet is a healthier way of eating. The list of benefits people have reported is enormous: \n● Weight loss ● More energy that doesn't vary wildly throughout the day ● Improved sleep ● Clearer skin ● Better digestion ● Improved fitness ● Reduced allergies. The list goes on but it's better to try it for yourself.\n\nThe 250 Paleo recipes included will help satisfy your cravings for delicious, healthy food. Inside Caveman Feast you'll find healthy breakfasts, filling main meals, tasty desserts, side dishes and snacks. \n\nRecipes include:\n● Perfect paleo burger\n● Paleo french toast\n● Healthy caveman cookies \n● Blueberry espresso brownies\n● Grilled buffalo shrimp\n● Smoked avocado lime pork chops\n● Apple dijon burgers\n● Homemade healthy mayonnaise\n● Caveman crunch bars\n● Sweet potato pasta\n● Beasty BBQ sauce\n● Caveman shepherd's pie\n\nFeatures in the app include:\n● Add recipes to your shopping list and see it organised by aisle, saving time at the grocery store\n● Track your calories and macros with our nutritional data\n● Increase or decrease recipe servings\n● Search by ingredient\n● Add notes to recipes\n● Share recipes with friends\n● Switch the measurement units\n● Plan a week of meals\n● Tick off your shopping list on your Apple Watch\n● Integrated with Apple Health\n\nThe quick and easy to follow recipes are by New York Times bestselling author George Bryant of civilizedcavemancooking.com. After decades in a constant battle with his weight and nearly losing both his legs while on deployment as a U.S. Marine, George decided to change his life. He went Paleo. What started as a simple website to share recipes with friends, has since grown into an award-winning food blog. After being in the Marines for 12 years, George now enjoys creating delicious Paleo recipes full-time, hoping to change as many lives as he can with real food recipes.\n\nGeorge works in collaboration with Abel James from the chart topping podcast \"The Fat-Burning Man show\" where he covers the Paleo lifestyle. Abel has been featured in Men's Health, Popular Science and Wired Magazine. You'll find exclusive content from Abel inside the app.\n\nNote: For users upgrading\nCaveman Feast 3.0 is available as a free update on iOS 9.3 and above.

We've added a new 60 recipe pack which can be added through a one off in app purchase.\n\nNote: Optional Meal Planner Pro Subscription\nMeal Planner Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

Now supporting remote control for ERME SV1, ERME SV3, ERME SV5, Anova Precision Cooker* (2014) and Anova Nano!\n\n● Sous Vide time/temperature recommendations for ingredients such as beef, veal, poultry, pork, lamb, game, fish, egg, fruits and vegetables. \n● Set your own timers: Heat up your waterbath, start, stop, rewind, get notified when your food is ready. \n● Remote control ERME basins or the original Anova Precision Cooker* over Bluetooth.\n\n“Sous Vide °Celsius packs in some of the features we wish Anova included” - The Sweethome\n\nMore features: \n● More than 400 Sous Vide experiences tested by professional chefs. \n● Temperature information in Fahrenheit or Celsius. \n● Measurements in inches or cm. \n● Step-by-step tutorials to get you started. \n● Know-How section: Technical Sous Vide terms explained. \n● Use personal notes to refine your own experiences. \n\nConvinced that Sous Vide is the best cooking method since the discovery of fire? Then you probably own a circulator or a similar device. To start, a zip-bag, a cooking pot and a thermometer is all you need. Many Sous Vide recipes work without special equipment. But you will need good advice!\n\nSous Vide has been adopted in professional kitchens for producing precise and consistent results. The Sous Vide method produces perfectly cooked food with outstanding flavor. Its success in high-end cuisine changed the culinary world. With a few starting tips anyone can use this technique. Step-by-step tutorials and Sous Vide timers (mini-recipes with an alarm) help you along the way.\n\nIdeas, suggestions or anything you would like to change? Contact us with your feedback on UserVoice!\n\nThe time for a piece of meat to reach a core temperature can be calculated. A formula using thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and surface heat transfer calculates the time such shapes as cylinders, cubes and steaks need to acquire a certain core temperature. Consider the PolyScience Toolbox App or Douglas Baldwin’s formulas for calculating pasteurization times.\n\nBut food is never an exact geometrical shape and waiting for an extra hour for a piece to reach an additional half a degree is impractical. Adjustments for speed and efficiency improve the Sous Vide experience. We have tested Sous Vide recommendations that work and tutorials that make the first steps easy - for professionals and home cooks alike!\n\nSous Vide - no other cooking method gives you so much control!\n\nDon’t get the Anova Pro or the new Anova Precision Cooker (2019) as these devices are no longer equipped with Bluetooth!"

Seasoned cooks and beginners alike will love this application. Click “…More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\nPlaced 5th in the German Apple Rewind 2010 in Lifestyle/iPad category\n\n\nWorth the money!!\n“I was a bit leery about buying this app because of the price but I took a chance and I'm very glad I did!!  This app is amazing -- there's a \"ton\" of recipes (21 chapters) and an A to Z glossary...literally a step-by-step cookbook with pictures at each step!! (...) I've never spent so much on an app but for this one, I'd spend the 9.99 again (no hesitation)!!” \n- LaDanaWendy\n\n\nI like this app a lot\n“This is a very interesting and useful app. The recipes are unusual in some cases...the step-by-step photos are extremely helpful (...). The glossary is not always as helpful as I would like (e.g. some entries are pictures only with no explanation) and that is why I rated it four stars. The developer is very responsive to inquiries. Be aware that in the bread recipes, he means fresh cake yeast even though the recipe says active dry yeast.  Everything I have made has turned out wonderfully.”\n- BPalto\n\nYour new in-laws, boss or family is coming over for dinner and you’re nervous. You don’t have much cooking experience but you want this evening’s meal to be special, memorable. What are you going to do?\n\nPerhaps start with a homemade asparagus soup with mint. Yes, that would be good. Follow it up with tender rack of lamb and delicious roast potatoes. Dessert could be a light and luscious vanilla soufflé. Perfect!\n\nOkay, it’s time to shop and cook. It’s alright, don’t panic. When you have The Cooks Encyclopedia on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, you have a professional cooking instructor right at your fingertips.\n\nTake The Cooks Encyclopedia to the grocery store. See? The list of ingredients is all right there. Oh-oh! No asparagus available? It’s fine, just do a search for zucchini or whatever other vegetable is available, to find an alternate recipe that will be just as delicious as the first one you chose. As you pick up items, just tap your screen to cross them off your list. The app makes it all so easy for you.\n\nBack at home, The Cooks Encyclopedia will guide you every step of the way. It’s a wonderful teaching tool, taking you by the hand and showing you, with more than 3,000 professionally taken photos, everything you need to do to prepare that sumptuous meal. Nothing is left out; you’ll never wonder what comes next or how to use a tool. It’s all in there, in total explanation and with visual aids and a glossary.\n\nThis is not another one of those apps with a bunch of rehashed recipes. You get more than 350 dishes that have been created, tested, proven and served by some of the best chefs and restaurants on the planet. \n\nJust look at some of the features offered in The Cooks Encyclopedia:\n* Photo cooking course\n* Super easy to use interface\n* Fun to use\n* 350 original, tested recipes created by professional chefs\n* More than 3,000 professional photos to guide you\n* Take ingredient lists along to the store on your device; cross off what you get\n* Easy search by keyword to find recipes for a specific ingredient\n* Can boost your cooking confidence\n\nThis is an 867 page cooking tutor squeezed into one app.  Download The Cooks Encyclopedia now and prepare your first three star meal tonight.\n\nSee this App in action here:  http://cooking.b-apps.net/"

      "label": "How many of us struggle with \"kitchen math?\" The Kitchen Calculator PRO app makes cooking and measuring so much easier. Kitchen Calculator PRO does all the recipe conversions for you, and makes it simple to scale recipes up (or down) to change the number of servings the recipe yields. With Kitchen Calculator PRO you can:\n\n1.Quickly scale your recipes (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using fractions!\n\n2.Convert ingredients from weight to volume, and vice versa ( cups to grams, ounces,  etc. )\n\n3.Supports several volume, weight, distance, and temperature conversions\n\n4.Enter amounts and view results in standard cooking fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc )\n\n5.Grow a database with your favorite ingredients! (see weight to volume )\n\n\nUSER COMMENTS\n\n***** Exactly what I've been looking for! - \"I just tested this out on a new cake recipe and it was simple, easy and accurate. The cake came out *perfect*!\" by njanehair.\n\n***** Yippee, perfection! - \"I cook 3 meals a day for my toddler and am always needing to scale recipes down so I'm not making ridiculous amounts of food\" by Cindi M.\n\n***** Brilliant - \"For a cook trained in the metric system, this tool is a dream come true\" by BeeDiana.\n\n\nSCALE YOUR RECIPES\n\nEasily convert and scale recipes in an instant. Doubling a recipe (or cutting a recipe in half) is simpler than ever before, with all the most common units of cooking measurement right at your fingertips. \n\n\nWEIGHT TO VOLUME CONVERSIONS\n\nWhat is so special about weight to volume conversions?\n\nWhen converting from weight to volume it is important to take into account the ingredient you are converting. As you know, a cup of sugar does not weigh the same as a cup of rice. Furthermore, a particular brand of sugar may weigh different from another.  This is all made easy with Kitchen Calculator PRO.\n\nSo, how does Kitchen Calculator handle weight to volume conversions?\n\n1.It comes with a database of common ingredients based on weight figures from the USDA (US Department of Agriculture).\n\n2.It allows you to quickly enter and save your own ingredient weight for more precise conversions.  In many cases, you can enter the values right off the product label, using fractions!  \n\n3.Kitchen Calculator will remember any saved ingredient information for future conversions.\n\nNOTE: The preset ingredient list is based on USDA  (US Department of Agriculture) figures and are approximate values. They may differ from the ingredients you use. For precise calculations we recommend entering the weights for your ingredients and, whenever possible using a scale.\n\nINGREDIENT DATA SOURCE\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 2007. USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 21. Nutrient Data Laboratory Home Page, http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata Note: Release numbers change as new versions are released.\n\nPLEASE LET US KNOW OF ANY ENHANCEMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE.\n\nFOR SUPPORT EMAIL: info@kitchencalculator.net"

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

This is achieved by the use of interactive games, animated stories, educational videos, and songs that will stimulate a unique way of teaching speaking and literacy basics to curious little ones starting from words till they reach sentence reading level.\n \nWe believe the entire process of learning the Arabic language needs to be reconstructed. This cannot be achieved with entertaining content alone, and that is why we have designed TAKALLAM, to provide caretakers and children with a full range of solutions to traditional learning methods. TAKALLAM uses a comprehensive and complete learning system that teaches Arabic literacy basics as a solution for at home and school learning.\n \nTo get the child to speak from the early stages, games are introduced to help form words by associating pictures; these pictures will then combine themselves to form sentences. The child will also be able to record new words and sentences after playing these games. Full record of the child's performance as well as voice recordings will be saved for parents/teachers to check later on.\nTAKALLAM is primarily a vocabulary-based program. There is also a special focus on 21st century skills and topics, such as:\nCreativity and Use of Imagination\nAllowing children to take the lead by choosing from different activities, this helps stimulate their imagination thus developing their language and vocabulary.\nCritical Thinking\nAllowing questioning, envisaging events, and keeping endings open in every story, helps children to reflect critically and build their higher order thinking skills as well as questioning techniques.\nWellbeing and Mindfulness\nTo develop healthy habits, we teach children how to take care of their body and mind and paying attention to what is happening in their environment with an attitude of empathy and curiosity.\nCommunication and Collaboration\nEducational methods designed with the child’s best interests in mind. Starting with phonics and finalizing with developing correct sentence reading and speaking skills.\n21st Century Skills\nA curriculum created by literacy experts keeping in mind the latest learning techniques that are adjusted to meet requirements of Arabic language learning.\nDiversity and Equality\nSelf-paced adaptation to individual learning skills giving the child a secure structure to work with to focus on building vocabulary that can be used in everyday life.\nProgress Tracking\nA distinct learning management system designed to track progress through verification of the child’s performance, meaning that no step of their journey is missed.\nHome-School Connection\nSupporting material, resources, and worksheets to further develop comprehension skills developed for parents/teachers so children can enjoy their personalized learning journey."

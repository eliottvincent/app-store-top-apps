      "label": "TAKALLAM is a self-learning early literacy program that teaches Arabic phonics, speaking and reading skills to children between 3 to 9 years old. This is achieved by the use of interactive games, animated stories, educational videos, and songs that will stimulate a unique way of teaching speaking and literacy basics to curious little ones starting from words till they reach sentence reading level.\n \nWe believe the entire process of learning the Arabic language needs to be reconstructed. This cannot be achieved with entertaining content alone, and that is why we have designed TAKALLAM, to provide caretakers and children with a full range of solutions to traditional learning methods. TAKALLAM uses a comprehensive and complete learning system that teaches Arabic literacy basics as a solution for at home and school learning.\n \nTo get the child to speak from the early stages, games are introduced to help form words by associating pictures; these pictures will then combine themselves to form sentences. The child will also be able to record new words and sentences after playing these games. Full record of the child's performance as well as voice recordings will be saved for parents/teachers to check later on.\nTAKALLAM is primarily a vocabulary-based program. There is also a special focus on 21st century skills and topics, such as:\nCreativity and Use of Imagination\nAllowing children to take the lead by choosing from different activities, this helps stimulate their imagination thus developing their language and vocabulary.\nCritical Thinking\nAllowing questioning, envisaging events, and keeping endings open in every story, helps children to reflect critically and build their higher order thinking skills as well as questioning techniques.\nWellbeing and Mindfulness\nTo develop healthy habits, we teach children how to take care of their body and mind and paying attention to what is happening in their environment with an attitude of empathy and curiosity.\nCommunication and Collaboration\nEducational methods designed with the child’s best interests in mind. Starting with phonics and finalizing with developing correct sentence reading and speaking skills.\n21st Century Skills\nA curriculum created by literacy experts keeping in mind the latest learning techniques that are adjusted to meet requirements of Arabic language learning.\nDiversity and Equality\nSelf-paced adaptation to individual learning skills giving the child a secure structure to work with to focus on building vocabulary that can be used in everyday life.\nProgress Tracking\nA distinct learning management system designed to track progress through verification of the child’s performance, meaning that no step of their journey is missed.\nHome-School Connection\nSupporting material, resources, and worksheets to further develop comprehension skills developed for parents/teachers so children can enjoy their personalized learning journey."

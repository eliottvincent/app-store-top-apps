Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "Archer NCLEX – with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!\n\nOver the past decade, Archer Review has provided \"extremely affordable and highly successful\" courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.\n\nArcher NCLEX Question banks include:\n\n- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.\n\n- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.\n\n- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.\n\n- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.\n\n- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress – we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the \"previous tests\" button\n\n- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev\n\n- \"Peer Stats\" gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.\n\n- Video Rationales: Our unique \"Video rationales\" accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer's master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through \"audio-visual reinforcement\" while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.\n\n- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.\n\n- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented."

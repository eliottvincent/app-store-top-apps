Note that failing to fill this form out, will make you unqualified and you’ll get back your paid fees. \n\nIf a member stops paying on others cycles for any reason, then Circlys App will be responsible to continue on and pay so there won’t be delays for anyone else. And Circlys it self will then take action to legal prosecution who ever is not paying on other members cycles. Though, Circlys might need power of attorney from you to proceed on legal procedures.\n\nIn the other hand, if you have a private circle with people you know, Circlys App will help you to easily manage and organize it through the App. You can add those members to your private circle from your phone contact list. Also, everyone will get notifications when it’s time to pay, you’ll have organized tables instead of the old traditional ones and you’ll have all needed information of others to make bank transfers like their full name, which bank, Account numbers. All those info are available inside App and can be locked out if wanted. Finally, you can get a legal contract for your private circle by purchasing an additional circle package.

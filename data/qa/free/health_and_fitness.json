      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

To forecast ovulation Period Tracker calculates 14 days before the projected start date of one's next period. Forecast accuracy depends on a number of factors including how regular one's cycle length is, when one actually ovulates during the cycle, and how many periods have been logged in the app. Anxiety, stress, diet, nutrition, exercise, environment, medications, age and other factors can also affect one's cycle from month to month. \n\nPlease email comments and suggestions to supportgpa@gmail.com."

The better you understand how well you are sleeping the more you are able to make changes in your routines to benefit your rest.  \n\nMy goal is to provide every Apple Watch owner with a free automatic sleep tracker that is simple and clear to understand.  For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

With over 20,000 trained, experienced, and accredited therapists covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it.\n \n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 20,000 licensed, accredited, and highly experienced therapists\n• Match with an available therapist who best fits your needs\n• Unlimited private one on one communication with your therapist\n• Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secure messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars\n \nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n \nLICENSED AND TRAINED therapistS & THERAPISTS\nThere are over 20,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n \nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n \nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n \nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n \nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason."

      "label": "Build stronger pelvic floor muscles with 5-minutes-a-day exercises. ZeusHealth App offers personalized training programs helping to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles that support the uterus, the bladder, and bowel. \r\n\r\nInstall ZeusHealth now and start your daily workouts to gain more control over your pelvic floor (PF). The weekly and daily training plan based on your health is easy to stick with and consists of effective exercises.\r\n \r\n  \r\nHow does the ZEUS app work?\n\n\r\n- The app is based on the pelvic floor muscle enhancement technique\r\n- After estimating your health condition, the app creates a personalized training program based on your needs and state of health.\r\n- You'll be able to exercise while doing any daily routine: driving, standing in line, or working. No one around you will ever notice.\r\n- The app will remind you to train, show your progress and tips to improve your training routine. \r\n \r\n10 benefits of using the ZEUS app\n\n\r\n1. \tEvaluation of your health with a smart algorithm\r\n2. \tCreation of a personalized workout plan\r\n3. \tEasy-to-do workouts that take just 5 minutes a day\r\n4. \tDetailed step-by-step explanations of the exercises\r\n5. \t10 difficulty levels\r\n6. \tSmooth workout intensity increase\r\n7. \tReminder function\r\n8. \tProgress tracker\r\n9. \tHelpful information, tips, lots of interesting articles, and insights\r\n10.  100% privacy protection\r\n \r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n \r\nZeusHealth programs are based on Kegel exercises. Hundreds of scientific studies prove that Kegel exercises (also: Kegels, PF exercises) have a positive long-lasting effect on men’s health.\r\n \r\nKegels target pelvic floor muscles. These muscles tend to weaken over time, negatively affecting men’s health. Doing Kegel exercises regularly helps men of all ages to strengthen their PF muscles, and gain more control of their bladder and perineal muscles. \r\n \r\nWhy choose ZeusHealth?\r\n \r\nWhen performing Kegel exercises, it's vital to choose the right set of exercises and do them regularly. Therefore, we've collected all the necessary types of Kegel exercises in a functional and comfortable-to-use app to make them more accessible and adjusted to your needs. The app will create your personal training program, show what type of exercises you need to do, and explain how to do the exercise for better results. In addition to Kegel exercises, our app has a bunch of helpful articles and tips on general men’s health.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nBilling Terms\n\n\r\n\r\nOur standard subscription options are:\r\n1 month subscription - $19.99\r\n3 months subscription - $29.99\r\n1 year subscription - $ 69.99\r\n\r\n\nSubscription unlocks all workout programs and additional functionality.

      "label": "WHOOP is your personalized digital fitness and health coach. Get the all-new WHOOP 4.0, our most advanced WHOOP yet, and pair it with your phone to unlock powerful personal insights, available directly in the WHOOP app.\n\nThe WHOOP app does so much more than track activity. WHOOP monitors your physiological data 24/7 to provide you with insights into your sleep habits, training, recovery, and overall health. WHOOP calibrates to your data over time, giving you personalized recommendations and coaching on what you can do – from when to go to bed to what behaviors to adopt – to optimize your performance and your health. This app requires a WHOOP wearable.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nSleep: Every night, WHOOP calculates your sleep performance by measuring the sleep you got compared to the sleep your body needs. You’ll wake up to a sleep score from 0 to 100%. Sleep Coach lets you know when you should go to bed to optimize your performance the following day. Now, with the release of WHOOP 4.0, Sleep Coach can also wake you when you’ve set an exact time, once you’ve reached your sleep goal, or when you’re fully recovered using a quiet, vibrating haptic alarm.\n\nStrain: WHOOP does more than just track your activity – it measures how much physical and mental stress you put on yourself throughout your entire day. WHOOP considers your exercise, work, errands, travel, parenting, and more to calculate a daily Strain score ranging from 0 to 21. Strain Coach then recommends your optimal target exertion range based on your Recovery score to help you maximize your gains without sacrificing your Recovery.\n\nRecovery: WHOOP lets you know how ready you are to perform by measuring your heart-rate variability, resting heart rate, sleep, and respiratory rate. You’ll get a daily Recovery score on a scale of 0 to 100%. When you’re in the green, you’re ready for strain, when you’re in the yellow or red, you may want to evaluate your training program. \n\nHealth: With the all-new WHOOP 4.0, you can now get a big-picture look at your overall health. The new WHOOP 4.0 features an SPO2 sensor and skin temperature sensor to measure your blood oxygen levels and skin temperature, in addition to your heart rate, resting heart rate, and heart-rate variability. You can easily see when your health is improving, or when you might be deviating from your baseline due to stress, illness, and more. Plus, you can download your personalized health reports to send to your physician, coach, or family.\n\nWhat else you can do in the WHOOP app:\n• Behavioral journal: Log daily behaviors – alcohol, nutrition, caffeine, meditation, electronic usage, stress and more – to see which choices impact your performance most\n• Dive into your weekly & monthly performance: Weekly and monthly Performance Assessments give you a better look at how individual behaviors and choices add to or detract from your performance\n• Join a team: Stay motivated and accountable by joining a team. Chat directly with your teammates in the app, or as a coach, see how your team’s training is going.\n• WHOOP Live: Overlay real-time Recovery, Sleep, Strain or heart-rate data onto your videos\n• Get help: Membership Services is available to answer any of your questions directly from the app\n• AMA: WHOOP experts are available weekly to answer your burning questions \n• Apple Health: WHOOP integrates with Apple’s Health app to sync activities and personalize your experience\n• Menstrual Cycle Coaching: Members who have a natural menstrual cycle gain strain and sleep coaching recommendations to account for monthly hormonal changes\n\n* Continued use of GPS and Bluetooth running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

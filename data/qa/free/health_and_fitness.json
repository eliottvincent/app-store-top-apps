It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Aplikasi akan mengidentifikasi status riwayat kontak atau kasus Covid-19 pengguna serta status vaksinasinya. Hal ini dilakukan untuk mendukung program penghentian penyebaran COVID-19 yang sedang diusahakan oleh pemerintah.\n\nSelain tujuan di atas, aplikasi ini juga dimanfaatkan untuk melakukan pendaftaran vaksinasi, scan QR untuk Check-In/Out dan dokumen perjalanan. Semua terkumpul jadi satu melalui aplikasi PeduliLindungi untuk memudahkan pengguna. \n\nSekecil apapun partisipasi Anda akan sangat berarti untuk menghentikan penularan COVID-19.

When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility.

With Zero, tap into the power of intermittent fasting and other healthy habits to lose weight and build momentum on your journey toward living longer, better.  \n\nWE’RE #1 FOR A REASON.\n\nZero Members have lost millions of pounds — and that’s no accident. Featured in Good Housekeeping, Men’s Health, Fortune, Techcrunch, Women’s Health, The Tim Ferriss Show, and more, Zero is the world’s most popular fasting app. We help you leverage the science of health in simple ways you can practice daily to build habits that last a lifetime.\n\nRooted in scientific research and supported by Zero’s world-class Scientific Advisory Board — led by Dr. Peter Attia — Zero helps you stack healthy habits to make big changes.

Get ready to meet a healthier you.\n\nSTART WITH JUST ONE TAP\n\nThe world's most popular Fasting Timer helps you track your fasts, your progress, and your goals. Start your Timer and stay on target with all popular fasting types, including: \n\n• 13-HOUR FAST, based on research by Dr. Satchin Panda (Salk Institute), this 13-hour or “circadian rhythm fast” aligns your eating window with your body’s clock.\n\n• 16-HOUR FAST, or the 16:8 intermittent fast, used by celebrities, athletes, and millions of Zero Members to manage weight and improve metabolic wellbeing.\n\n• 18-HOUR FAST, or 18:6, for more advanced fasters.\n\n• Other popular fasts include OMAD (one meal a day), the 20:4 fast, and custom prolonged fasts up to 7 days.\n\nGET PERSONAL\n\nZero’s real-time tips, individualized stats, and Personalized Fasting Zones have helped millions of Members form new habits and achieve their weight-loss and health-gain goals.

Zero’s innovative yet simple features help you build lifelong habits across these Four Pillars for accelerated progress and transformative change.\n\nSEE THE FULL PICTURE\n\nThe Loop helps you visualize your journey and celebrate wins across the Four Pillars of Health.

Watch as your smart choices add up over days, weeks, months, and years.\n\nBUILD CONSISTENCY\n\nBuild actionable, data-driven habits with the Habit Tracker. Build consistency by logging your meals, workouts, and more. If you’re using an Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura Ring, or other apps and wearables, you can sync them with Zero to make this a completely automated experience.\n\nMAINTAIN MOMENTUM\n\nStay focused with expert-led, science-backed content, community Challenges, achievements, and more.

      "label": "WHOOP is your personalized digital fitness and health coach. Get the all-new WHOOP 4.0, our most advanced WHOOP yet, and pair it with your phone to unlock powerful personal insights, available directly in the WHOOP app.\n\nThe WHOOP app does so much more than track activity. WHOOP monitors your physiological data 24/7 to provide you with insights into your sleep habits, training, recovery, and overall health. WHOOP calibrates to your data over time, giving you personalized recommendations and coaching on what you can do – from when to go to bed to what behaviors to adopt – to optimize your performance and your health. This app requires a WHOOP wearable.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nSleep: Every night, WHOOP calculates your sleep performance by measuring the sleep you got compared to the sleep your body needs. You’ll wake up to a sleep score from 0 to 100%. Sleep Coach lets you know when you should go to bed to optimize your performance the following day. Now, with the release of WHOOP 4.0, Sleep Coach can also wake you when you’ve set an exact time, once you’ve reached your sleep goal, or when you’re fully recovered using a quiet, vibrating haptic alarm.\n\nStrain: WHOOP does more than just track your activity – it measures how much physical and mental stress you put on yourself throughout your entire day. WHOOP considers your exercise, work, errands, travel, parenting, and more to calculate a daily Strain score ranging from 0 to 21. Strain Coach then recommends your optimal target exertion range based on your Recovery score to help you maximize your gains without sacrificing your Recovery.\n\nRecovery: WHOOP lets you know how ready you are to perform by measuring your heart-rate variability, resting heart rate, sleep, and respiratory rate. You’ll get a daily Recovery score on a scale of 0 to 100%. When you’re in the green, you’re ready for strain, when you’re in the yellow or red, you may want to evaluate your training program. \n\nHealth: With the all-new WHOOP 4.0, you can now get a big-picture look at your overall health. The new WHOOP 4.0 features an SPO2 sensor and skin temperature sensor to measure your blood oxygen levels and skin temperature, in addition to your heart rate, resting heart rate, and heart-rate variability. You can easily see when your health is improving, or when you might be deviating from your baseline due to stress, illness, and more. Plus, you can download your personalized health reports to send to your physician, coach, or family.\n\nWhat else you can do in the WHOOP app:\n• Behavioral journal: Log daily behaviors – alcohol, nutrition, caffeine, meditation, electronic usage, stress and more – to see which choices impact your performance most\n• Dive into your weekly & monthly performance: Weekly and monthly Performance Assessments give you a better look at how individual behaviors and choices add to or detract from your performance\n• Join a team: Stay motivated and accountable by joining a team. Chat directly with your teammates in the app, or as a coach, see how your team’s training is going.\n• WHOOP Live: Overlay real-time Recovery, Sleep, Strain or heart-rate data onto your videos\n• Get help: Membership Services is available to answer any of your questions directly from the app\n• AMA: WHOOP experts are available weekly to answer your burning questions \n• Apple Health: WHOOP integrates with Apple’s Health app to sync activities and personalize your experience\n• Menstrual Cycle Coaching: Members who have a natural menstrual cycle gain strain and sleep coaching recommendations to account for monthly hormonal changes\n\n* Continued use of GPS and Bluetooth running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

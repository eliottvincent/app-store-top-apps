      "label": "No matter when or where, Portals of Prayer inspires you to live each day as a disciple of Christ. Through each daily audio-and-textual devotion, you meditate on God’s Word and see it working through you in your life. New updates allow for a seamless and easy-to-use interface, keeping you focused on your devotional time.\n\n\nWhat’s New?\r\n\nWelcome to the NEW Portals of Prayer App. There have been many updates to help make your experience seamless, from the subscription feature to how the devotions are displayed. Here’s a list of all the new features: \r\n\nNavigation Bar\r\n\nTwo features from the original navigation bar have now moved. The bottom still contains “Devotions” and “Favorites.” “Prayers” has now been renamed “Resources” to better represent its offerings. This tab will still be located on the bottom navigation bar. “Search” and “Settings” have been relocated to the top navigation bar. \r\n\nDevotions \r\n\nAn updated design allows for a sleek and modern devotions screen. Press the Play button in the middle of the image to hear your audio devotion. Swipe right or left to see previous or future devotions. \r\n\nArchives\r\n\nNot only can you search based on topic or month, but devotions are now also categorized based on year and quarter to make finding a devotion from the print version that much easier. \r\n\nResources\r\n\nThe “Prayers” tab is now called “Resources” and includes daily prayers, prayers for special occasions, and author biographies. \r\n\nSettings\r\n\nThe app now offers a dark mode for your reading convenience. \r\n\nFavorites\r\n\nThe app now syncs your favorites across all your devices so long as you use the same Concordia Publishing House account. \r\n\r\nAbout Portals of Prayer\r\n\nPortals of Prayer is a quarterly print devotional that has been a favorite for generations of readers. Since 1937, the meaningful daily devotions and ending prayers have offered a daily moment of time with God, comforting believers through their lives. \r\n\nConcordia Publishing House Portals of Prayer App Subscription\r\n\nWhile the Portals of Prayer App is free to download, you need a subscription to access all the amazing features. A new subscription is $9.99 per year and can be purchased through the app. Here’s what each subscription includes:\r\n-\tOver 10 years of Portals of Prayer content\r\n-\tDaily audio and textual devotions\r\n-\tMeaningful daily prayers\r\n-\tThe ability to mark the devotions you like best as “Favorite”\r\n\nYour yearly subscription will auto-renew unless the auto-renew feature is turned off. To avoid being charged with the auto-renewal, it must be turned off at least 24-hours prior to the renewal date. You can see the end date of your subscription in the app’s “Settings” tab.\r\n\nA subscription to the Portals of Prayer App does not, and is not, included in the print subscription to Portals of Prayer. These subscriptions are separate entities. \r\n\nPrivacy Policy and Terms of Service\r\n\nPlease visit https://www1.cph.org/portals/terms.aspx to view the terms and conditions of the Portals of Prayer App."

Featuring the latest news, excellent writing and strong opinions on nude-related topics from travel and leisure to art and culture, backed up by some brilliant photography, H&E offers unrivalled coverage of the naturist world, and if you are a newcomer to the lifestyle, the magazine is a great place to start. This is a moderated version of the magazine, and please note the H&E app is entirely separate to our digital edition available via browser.\n\nEvery month H&E naturist is packed with a host of features on practically every aspect of the naturist lifestyle around the world. Every issue carries an updated UK & Ireland club and swim guide and What's On listings, plus regular columns on France, Spain and Portugal, nude-related film and book reviews, and a Q&A column which aims to answer readers' questions about naturism, whether they be common or more unusual inquiries. \n\nThere is also a regular food column with the young Manchester-based Naked Vegan Cooks, who you might have seen on TV in C4's widely trailed My Daughter, the Teenage Nudist. \n\nThroughout the year, special features offer a closer look at a wider range of destinations, from the USA & Caribbean and Greece, to what the UK has to offer with updates from home grown naturist clubs and attractions. \n\nIf you’re interested in the naturist lifestyle, where to meet like-minded people and how to get involved then H&E is essential reading.\n\nNote: This app is a moderated version of H&E Naturist Magazine, as full nudity is not allowed on this platform.\n\nSingle issues are available to purchase at £3.99 and you can take out an annual subscription at £28.99 a year. \n\nSubscription-related details:\n\n-The subscription will include the current issue if you do not already own it, and subsequently-published future issues. \n\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n\n- You may turn off auto-renewing subscriptions by going to your user’s Account Settings after purchase.

      "label": "Madhyamam is India's first international newspaper-with Gulf Madhyamam, the largest circulated newspaper in the Middle East, it is also the only Malayalam daily published from seven countries. Madhyamam is the third largest Malayalam daily in India in terms of circulation and advertisement volume. Now into its twenty-fifth year, it has grown into 19 editions including Gulf and online editions. \nBut it's not the quantitative merit that sets it apart. It places great value on quality, truth and credibility. Madhyamam, run by a Public Charitable Trust, is not linked to any interest group or business houses. Its news is often rated the most independent and truthful and its editorial fearless and impartial. The paper does not accept advertisements that exploit women's honour and offend human dignity, titillate base emotions, promote superstitions or dishonest business. The many public interest campaigns Madhyamam initiated by its investigative reporting, sacrificing much advertisement income, have helped to create a fiercely loyal readership for the paper. And the circle is growing wherever Malayalis live. \nMadhyamam has a strict code of ethics on news, views and advertisements. It believes that news is sacred and not to be tampered with. It also believes that comment should be free.Both are age-old norms but fast fading from the media under survival pressure. Madhyamam sets great store by universal human values that transcend boundaries of caste, race, religion and region. The paper has established beyond doubt that even in these days of crass profiteering, value-based journalism is viable, and that it still has adherents and public support. That is why it has grown in spite of its strict ethical codes. \n\nWeekly: As a decennial contribution to the cultural area of Malayalam, Madhyamam Weekly was launched on 19 Feb, 1998. The editorial team had at its head noted writer and journalist C.Radhakrishnan. In a matter of about 40 weeks it has established as a forerunner of Malayalam periodical journalism, true to its claim of providing a new reading culture.

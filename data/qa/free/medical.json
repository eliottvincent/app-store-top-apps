[1] [2]\n\nYou can use the FreeStyle LibreLink app to:\n\n* View your current glucose reading, trend arrow and glucose history\n* Receive low or high glucose alarms with FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors [2]\n* See reports, such as Time in Target and Daily Patterns\n* Share your data with your doctor and family, with your permission\n\nSMARTPHONE COMPATIBILITY\nCompatibility may vary between phones and operating systems. Learn more about compatible phones at http://FreeStyleLibre.com.\n\nUSING YOUR APP AND READER WITH THE SAME SENSOR\nAlarms can only be issued on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader or your phone (not both). To receive alarms on your phone, you must start the sensor with the app. To receive alarms on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader, you must start the sensor with your reader. Once the sensor has been started with the reader, you can also scan that sensor with your phone.\n\nRemember that the app and reader do not share data with each other. For complete information on a device, scan your sensor every eight hours with that device; otherwise, your reports will not include all your data. You can upload and view data from all of your devices on LibreView.com.\n\nAPP INFORMATION\nFreeStyle LibreLink is intended for measuring glucose levels in people with diabetes when used with a sensor. For more information on how to use FreeStyle LibreLink, refer to the User’s Manual, which can be accessed through the app. If you require a printed User’s Manual, contact Abbott Diabetes Care Customer Support.\n\nConsult a healthcare professional to confirm if this product is right for you or if you have questions about how to use this product to make treatment decisions.\n\nLearn more at http://FreeStyleLibre.com.\n\n[1] If you are using the FreeStyle LibreLink app, you must also have access to a blood glucose monitoring system, as the app does not provide one.  \n\n[2] Alarms that you receive do not include your glucose reading, so you must scan your sensor to check your glucose.\n\n[3] Use of the FreeStyle LibreLink app and LibreLinkUp app require registration with the LibreView system, which is provided by Abbott and Newyu, Inc.\n\nFreeStyle, Libre, and related brand marks are marks of Abbott.\n\nFor additional legal notices and terms of use, go to http://FreeStyleLibre.com.\n\n========\n\nTo resolve any technical or Customer Service issues that you are having with a FreeStyle Libre product, please contact FreeStyle Libre Customer Service directly."

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

You might want to know if their glucose levels go too high or too low, be able to quickly and easily access their insulin pump and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system information. \r\n \r\nWith the CareLink™ Connect app, now you can remotely see their glucose levels and insulin pump information wherever you are, so you can know how they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app helps you quickly accomplish these tasks: \r\nLet you securely view glucose levels, graphs, and trends\r\nSends you high or low glucose levels notifications, so you can be informed and supportive\r\nShows you the status of the insulin pump system, for greater peace of mind\r\n\r\nTo remotely view pump system information, family members or friends need to install the CareLink™ Connect app on their compatible mobile device. Also, the person with diabetes needs a MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump, the MiniMed™ Mobile app installed on a compatible mobile device, which then should be connected online to the CareLink™ software. To find a list of compatible devices, please visit your local Medtronic website. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: In order to receive real-time updates, the app needs to continuously receive data from the CareLink™ servers, and the insulin pump system needs to sync with the CareLink™ servers through the MiniMed™ Mobile app. The CareLink™ Connect app only works with the MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump systems; it currently does not support other standalone CGM systems, MiniMed™ or Paradigm™ insulin pumps. \r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app is intended to provide a secondary display of insulin pump and CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) system data on a supported mobile device. CareLink™ Connect app is not intended to replace the real-time display of insulin pump or CGM data on the primary display device. All therapy decisions should be based on the primary display device.\r\n\r\nCareLink™ Connect app is not intended to analyze or modify the insulin pump and CGM data that it receives.

In order to fill that gap, we came up with Visualmed. \n\nThe app version of visualmed lets users sort clinical trials based on the field of medicine. For example, if you're looking for landmark trials in cardiology then simply access the cardiology subcategory. Additionally, we have added year based sorting of studies that let users access studies that are published in 2020 or which were published back in the 90s!. The best way to use this app is when you're rounding on your patients and a question arises regarding patient care for which you need to look up supportive evidence in the form of landmark clinical trial on that topic.\n\nWith our search tool, you can quickly put in keywords to access clinical trials on that subject. For example, if you write aspirin the search bar you will obtain access to all landmark clinical trials done on aspirin. Tapping on a trial will give you a visual summary highlighting the key objective, type, and primary findings of that trial.\n\nThe app gets updated with more recent studies every day so make sure to check out the recent tab to access all the latest clinical trials in medicine. We added 30 new trials every month so with just one time subscription fee you will be getting access to all our trials visual abstracts.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n1. Access an ever-growing list of landmark clinical trials visual summaries for lifetime with just one time $6 subscription fee.\n2. Sort and search for trials based on disease, topic or year of publication\n3. Bookmark your favorite visual summaries for later reference\n4. Each summary is linked back to the original article"

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen.

You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Whether as a Paramedic on scene or as a clinician in hospital, this app can assist in running structured and effective adult cardiac arrest scenarios. Developed by an anaesthetist training in London, this app takes into consideration the most recent Resuscitation Council (UK) Guidelines 2015.\n \nIt serves as an aide-memoire for basic tasks that can easily be overlooked in stressful scenarios. iArrest also incorporates a number of timers to assist with rhythm analysis, adrenaline timings and arrest duration. It will remind the user via audible and visual cues about necessary  interventions even if a clinician’s phone is muted. iArrest has been programmed to prevent phones from going into sleep mode, in order to ensure continuous use throughout the arrest.\n \niArrest will record the exact time an important event or an intervention has occurred and present the user with a detailed log of events. These logs can be copied to the clipboard and used for documentation and record keeping.\n\n\niArrest is currently undergoing extensive testing in simulated and real world scenarios. \n\nWe are continuously improving and expanding on iArrest’s functionality. \n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\niArrest can not replace sound knowledge in Advance Life Support and should not be used by non-ALS trained clinicians.

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

      "label": "Visualmed app provides visual infographic based summaries of landmark clinical trials in medicine and other fields of health care. \n\nThe pace at which new data in medicine is getting published is tremendous and to keep up with it we need a way to quickly access the key points of landmark clinical trials. In order to fill that gap, we came up with Visualmed. \n\nThe app version of visualmed lets users sort clinical trials based on the field of medicine. For example, if you're looking for landmark trials in cardiology then simply access the cardiology subcategory. Additionally, we have added year based sorting of studies that let users access studies that are published in 2020 or which were published back in the 90s!. The best way to use this app is when you're rounding on your patients and a question arises regarding patient care for which you need to look up supportive evidence in the form of landmark clinical trial on that topic.\n\nWith our search tool, you can quickly put in keywords to access clinical trials on that subject. For example, if you write aspirin the search bar you will obtain access to all landmark clinical trials done on aspirin. Tapping on a trial will give you a visual summary highlighting the key objective, type, and primary findings of that trial.\n\nThe app gets updated with more recent studies every day so make sure to check out the recent tab to access all the latest clinical trials in medicine. We added 30 new trials every month so with just one time subscription fee you will be getting access to all our trials visual abstracts.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n1. Access an ever-growing list of landmark clinical trials visual summaries for lifetime with just one time $6 subscription fee.\n2. Sort and search for trials based on disease, topic or year of publication\n3. Bookmark your favorite visual summaries for later reference\n4. Each summary is linked back to the original article"

The application’s data integrity and updates are maintained even without an Internet connection. \nThe vaccination status displayed on a user’s mobile screen is meant as an official document enabling users access to establishments with restrictions on entry of non-vaccinated individuals.\n\n\nيتيح التطبيق للمواطنين المصريين والأجانب الذين تم تسجيلهم في منظومة اللقاح الخاص بفيروس كوفيد-19 المصرية من التسجيل وعرض بيانات اللقاح الخاصة بهم ومشاركتها بطريقة آمنة. يعرض التطبيق الحالة المحدثة عن تلقي جرعات التطعيم الخاص بفيروس كوفيد-19 وكذلك المواعيد المحددة لكل جرعة.\nيتيح التطبيق مشاركة بيانات التطعيم بطريقتين مؤمّنتين، إحداهما بصرية من خلال مشاركة حالة التطعيم من خلال شاشة الهاتف المحمول، والأخري إلكترونية من خلال QR code يمكن قراءته بكاميرا الهاتف المحمول ومن ثم الضغط على الرابط الذي سيتم إظهاره. في كلتا الحالتين يقوم التطبيق بتغيير لون خلفية الشاشة بحسب حالة اللقاح لسهولة التعرف على الحالة بطريقة بصرية سريعة.\nيمكن للأعضاء المسجلين في التطبيق إضافة أكثر من وثيقة سفر إلى ملفهم الشخصي واستخدام تلك البيانات لمشاركتها مع حالة التطعيم أثناء السفر من وإلى خارج مصر.\n يمكن للأعضاء المسجلين مشاركة بيانات التطعيم الخاصة بهم بدون الحاجة للاتصال بالإنترنت. \nتعتبر حالة التطعيم المعروضة في التطبيق بمثابة وثيقة رسمية لدخول الأماكن التي تشترط أخذ اللقاح لدخولها."

Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently.

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

Stay on top of your refrigerator and freezer stashes. Know when your milk will expire. Stop guessing or messing with spreadsheets. Start your Milk Stash.\n\nThere are tons of breast pumping apps out there. But so much happens after you turn off the breast pump. Pump. Stash. Freeze. Thaw. Feed. And it's often a team effort. Finally, there's a pumping app for all that other stuff too.\n\nWe'll help you get set up with a simple, inexpensive DIY storage solution. Already have your own system? No problem. We work with that too.\n\nUse Milk Stash to:\n+ Log your pumping sessions.\n+ Keep track of multiple stashes across your refrigerator, freezer and deep freeze.\n+ Get notified before your milk will expire to\n+ Better plan your rotation between frozen and refrigerated milk to\n+ Maximize freshness, improving your baby's nutrition and immune system.\n+ Coordinate with your caregiver(s) to\n+ Know what's happening while you're away and pumping.\n+ See statistics on your milk supply and production/consumption rates.\n+ Hunt down food allergies by tracking what you ate for each bottle/bag you've stored.\n\nAlso:\n+ Free and ad-free.\n+ Synchronize data between multiple devices and accounts.\n+ Web application for caregivers who don't have Apple devices.\n\nMilk Stash is a labor of love by a small team in Boulder, Colorado. Thanks for your support. We'd love to hear from you at feedback@milkstash.com."

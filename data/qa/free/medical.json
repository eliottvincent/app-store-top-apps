The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

Beginning with the patient’s presenting symptoms, they ultimately narrow down multiple options to one condition.  The DSM-5 Differential Diagnosis Handbook can play a critical role in this process by improving the diagnostic process of psychiatric conditions.  Leveraging latest DSM-5 classifications from the American Psychiatric Association, users are able to use a trusted 6-step process when dealing with, sometimes unfamiliar, psych conditions.  \n\nExclusive, integrated interactive decision trees provide a step-by-step process of asking yes or no questions to find a tentative diagnosis.  When the initial diagnosis is reached, tables of differential diagnoses are presented to help confirm or present new options.  \n\nFEATURES\n• Interactive decision trees for narrowing down psychiatric diagnoses\n• Algorithms for enhanced assessment\n• The latest DSM-5 classifications and ICD-10 codes\n• Helpful tables of differential diagnoses\n• Detailed entries featuring definitions for each psychiatric condition\n• Expansive guidance on all 6 steps of the differential diagnosis process \n• Advanced Search to help find topics quickly \n• “Favorites” for bookmarking important entries\n\nAuthor: Michael B.

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

Dexcom G6 is approved for children age 2 and older.\n\nThe Dexcom G6 System provides personalized trend alerts right on your smart device and lets you see when your glucose levels are going too low, or too high, so you can better manage your diabetes. The Alert Schedule feature lets you schedule and customize a second set of alerts.  Custom alert sounds are available, including a Vibrate-Only option on the phone for glucose alerts. The only exception is the Urgent Low Alarm, which you can’t turn off.\n\n\nThe Always Sound setting allows you to receive certain Dexcom CGM Alerts even if your phone sound is off, set to vibrate, or in Do Not Disturb mode. This will allow you to silence calls or texts but still receive audible CGM Urgent Low Alarm and alerts: Low and High Glucose alert, Urgent Low Soon, and Rise and Fall Rate.  Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default. A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.  For safety, the Urgent Low alarm and these alerts can’t be silenced: Transmitter Failed, Sensor Failed, and App Stopped. \n\nIn addition to the accurate performance provided by the Dexcom Sensor, you’ll receive other valuable features:\n\n•\tShare your glucose data with your followers who can monitor your glucose data and trends on their compatible smart device with the Dexcom Follow app. Share and Follow functions require an internet connection\n•\tHealth app access so you can share retrospective glucose data with third party apps\n•\tToday View widget, which allows you to view your glucose data on the lock screen of your smart device\n•\tAsk Siri* to read your current glucose value, using a custom phrase\n•\tA Dexcom CLARITY link on the landscape trend graph lets you easily transition to the CLARITY App to view more information on your glucose trends\n\n*Siri may not be available in all regions.

Consult a doctor, get your medicines delivered and get your lab tests done while you stay comfortable at home!\n\nWe are extremely honoured to partner with the Ministry of Health Sri Lanka, GMOA and ICTA to include qualified government doctors on our platform. You can now consult government doctors for free via oDoc from wherever you are.\n\nAs of January 2020, oDoc, Sri Lanka’s largest telemedicine platform, has over 1000 partner GPs and specialists, including many senior consultants across 60+ specialisations. All doctors on oDoc are Sri Lanka Medical Council registered with 5+ years of experience. They are well equipped to manage oDoc consultations and issue prescriptions. This means you have access to high-quality care without the hassle of traffic, waiting rooms and queues.\n\nDoesn't it sound perfect? However, you may wonder how a doctor can correctly diagnose you without seeing you in person? Well, it's very much like any other doctor consultation you’ve had! Understanding your medical history and your symptoms is as important as a physical examination. According to the American Medical Association, 75% of doctor consultations can be diagnosed online, and our doctors are skilled in providing a diagnosis and medical advice online.\n\nAs a policy, we refund you in the event your doctor determines a physical examination is required. In these cases, the doctor will be paid by us. This means you pay only when you receive care, and doctors are always compensated for their professional services.\n\nOn oDoc, you own all your data, and your data is stored securely on HIPAA-compliant servers."

Measure your stress to manage it!\n\n- What is the principle behind StressScan? − \nMany of the functions essential to maintaining human health are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is medically recognized that the balance of the autonomic nervous system can become disordered through fatigue and other stress, stemming from causes such as work and human relationships. By analyzing the waveform of your heartbeat as measured at the fingertip, StressScan can analyze the balance of your autonomic nervous system and measure your stress level on a stress index of 1 to 100.\n\n- You can trust StressScan! - \nThe technology used by StressScan is based on heart rate variability analysis, which is widely recognized in the field of heart rate analysis and autonomic nervous system research. \nAlthough heart rate variability analysis technology is not yet generally well known, many medical institutions and companies have taken an interest and are beginning to put it to use. The technology is seeing use even at the cutting edge of stress care, including adoption by the US military to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers returning from the battlefield, and by NASA for astronaut training and health management.\n\n- Usable in a range of scenarios! - \n· Periodic checking of daily stress level\n· Checking the effects of favorite meals and drinks on stress\n· Checking relaxation while traveling or at a favorite spot\n\n- Device compatibility -\nThe app is intended for use with a camera- and flash-equipped smartphone. It is not usable with devices that do not have a camera and flash.\n\n- Usage environment -\nAn Internet connection is required to use the app. External support for measurement functions is used for complex stress analysis."

      "label": "Visualmed app provides visual infographic based summaries of landmark clinical trials in medicine and other fields of health care. \n\nThe pace at which new data in medicine is getting published is tremendous and to keep up with it we need a way to quickly access the key points of landmark clinical trials. In order to fill that gap, we came up with Visualmed. \n\nThe app version of visualmed lets users sort clinical trials based on the field of medicine. For example, if you're looking for landmark trials in cardiology then simply access the cardiology subcategory. Additionally, we have added year based sorting of studies that let users access studies that are published in 2020 or which were published back in the 90s!. The best way to use this app is when you're rounding on your patients and a question arises regarding patient care for which you need to look up supportive evidence in the form of landmark clinical trial on that topic.\n\nWith our search tool, you can quickly put in keywords to access clinical trials on that subject. For example, if you write aspirin the search bar you will obtain access to all landmark clinical trials done on aspirin.

      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

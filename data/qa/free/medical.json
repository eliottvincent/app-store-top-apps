The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

Meticulously built over ten years from high-resolution cross-sectional photographs of real cadavers, the app provides an accurate and visually stunning reconstruction of the anatomy of the abdomen.\n\nThe easy to use and intuitive interface lets you choose precisely the anatomy you want to see, from exactly the angle you want to see it. This flexibility is supported by a wealth of user-friendly tools to help you set up your ideal anatomical image, quickly and easily:\n\n•\tThe Gallery contains 22 pre-set scenes, designed by an in-house team of anatomical experts, to clearly and comprehensibly present in-depth regional and systemic anatomy of the abdomen. Each scene is divided into five layers to provide greater control over the depth of anatomy shown; making tailoring the anatomy you want to see simple and quick.\n\n•\tThe Contents folders arrange all 1,070 structures systemically, meaning you can browse by subcategory and switch all related structures on at once. It provides an excellent learning tool – for example turn on all branches of the superior mesenteric artery, or all the muscles of the abdominal wall.\n\n•\tThe Contents layer controls split each system into five layers – from deep to superficial. This allows you to quickly build up different systems to the depth you want to see.\n\n**Save to Favourites**\n\nSave the views you create for later in the Favourites, save anything as an image, or share with another user as a URL link. Use the pins, labels and drawing tools to customize your images for enlivened presentations, engaging course materials and handouts – all from your iPad!\n\n**Informative**\n\nRead detailed and accurate text for each structure using the T icon, and in a feature unique to Primal Pictures, each anatomical term in the text is linked to the appropriate model in the 3D model. Selecting these links will highlight the relevant structures, bringing the text to life and make learning anatomy more visual and immediate.\n\n**Context**\n\nSee each structure in context with the anatomy that surrounds it. Explore these relationships and easily navigate to related anatomical structures to expand your learning. Select a field name in the right-hand menu to show the anatomical category and sub-category of the structure for added understanding and simple navigation.\n\n**Technical Specifications**\n\niPad 3 and above only.\niPad Air and above for optimal viewing.\niPhone 6 and above for best performance."

Also, the person with diabetes needs a MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump, the MiniMed™ Mobile app installed on a compatible mobile device, which then should be connected online to the CareLink™ software. To find a list of compatible devices, please visit your local Medtronic website. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: In order to receive real-time updates, the app needs to continuously receive data from the CareLink™ servers, and the insulin pump system needs to sync with the CareLink™ servers through the MiniMed™ Mobile app. The CareLink™ Connect app only works with the MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump systems; it currently does not support other standalone CGM systems, MiniMed™ or Paradigm™ insulin pumps. \r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app is intended to provide a secondary display of insulin pump and CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) system data on a supported mobile device. CareLink™ Connect app is not intended to replace the real-time display of insulin pump or CGM data on the primary display device. All therapy decisions should be based on the primary display device.\r\n\r\nCareLink™ Connect app is not intended to analyze or modify the insulin pump and CGM data that it receives.

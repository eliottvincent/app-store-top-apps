The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

The only exception is the Urgent Low Alarm, which you can’t turn off.\n\n\nThe Always Sound setting allows you to receive certain Dexcom CGM Alerts even if your phone sound is off, set to vibrate, or in Do Not Disturb mode.

Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default. A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.

      "label": "The simplest program to track breastfeeding, pumping, bottle feeding, solid food consumption, diapers, sleep schedule, height and weight, and more.\n\nWith the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.\n\nThe birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

This app uses the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale. \n\nDisclaimer: This test is NOT applicable to children and is also NOT a diagnostic test.

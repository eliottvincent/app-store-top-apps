      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

      "label": "The acclaimed F/A-18 Hornet combat flight simulation by Graphsim Entertainment comes to iPhone and iPad in it's best incarnation to date. With unmatched depth and realism, there's nothing else like it on mobile devices!\n\nFEATURES\n• High-fidelity physics-based aircraft flight dynamics.\n• Realistic HUD, cockpit and weapon systems.\n• Intense, white-knuckle aerial combat.\n• Innovative control overlay system for pilot input.\n• Ruthless AI means skilled enemies and wingmen.\n• Scoring system with awards and rank promotions.\n• Full support for your GAME CONTROLLER.*\n• Complete step-by-step guided FLIGHT SCHOOL tutorials.\n• Create your own mission with the SORTIE editor.\n• Quickly enter combat with the DOGFIGHT generator.\n• Fly 50 challenging CAMPAIGN missions.\n• LAN MULTIPLAYER mode for up to four nearby players.\n• Watch a REPLAY of your campaign mission.\n\nPilot the awesome F/A-18 Hornet in this highly realistic fighter jet simulation. Using physical properties of the actual aircraft, the simulation flies just like the real thing.\n\nInteractive control overlays make it easy to use the extensive cockpit systems. It not only allows for input, but also provides feedback for aircraft systems such as radar mode or landing gear status. You control the aircraft's flight stick by rotating and tilting your device, or optionally using a compatible game controller.\n\nAcquire a target on the realistically simulated AN/APG-65 radar. Then launch an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile and watch it track its target with its realistically simulated guidance system.\n\nBecause the game captures performance differences between aircraft, aerial combat is highly realistic. So when you tangle with an enemy MiG-27, real-world tactics can save your day.\n\nEnemy pilots are skilled adversaries, proficient in dogfighting as well as ground attack. You may find yourself in a turning battle with a MiG-21 while simultaneously evading a SAM missile. If you can survive, you've earned bragging rights.\n\nConnect up to four nearby players (within Bluetooth range or connected to the same Wi-Fi access point) for exciting real-time air-to-air combat.\n\nDirect your wingman to fly in formation or to come to your aid. Request landing clearance from the control tower or get guidance from the Landing Signal Officer on final approach to a carrier landing.\n\nThe game includes 16 practice missions and 50 campaign missions. Increase your score with each mission and with every downed enemy aircraft. Earn awards and promotions as your career advances. Hours of gameplay wait.\n\nYou'll get a taste of what it's like to be fighter pilot. If you're interested in aviation, or military history, then FA-18 Hornet is for you. \n\n*iOS 13 now allows you to connect your Bluetooth PS-4 or XBOX ONE game controller."

      "label": "Learn to fly radio controlled gliders and powered planes in this highly realistic flight simulator. You can use it to practise aerobatics, have a lazy fly on a rainy day, or compete to fly as fast as possible in a number of races.\n\nIt includes 28 gliders (including some electric), 15 powered planes (including three control-line), a hang glider, and a quadcopter. The simulation includes realistic models of wind flow, turbulence and thermals. You can fly with AI/computer controlled planes too, keeping you company in the air.\n\nThe sceneries include a variety of slope and flat field sites. Some are panoramic, with high graphical quality, but a fixed viewpoint. Others are 3D scenes where you can fly in or behind the plane.\n\nIt is highly configurable, so you can create and explore new terrains from inside the app, as well as adjust settings such as the wind modelling, aeroplane settings (including size and ballast) etc.\n\nIf you've never flown a radio-controlled plane before, you'll probably find it hard to fly at first. Check the support website for a video and hints on how to fly. PicaSim flight simulator won't teach you how to fly, but it can help you learn - persevere and the sky is the limit!\n\nThe planes included are:\n\nGliders/sailplanes: ASW15, Banana, Canard, Discus, Trainer, Neoslope, Genie, Icarus (DLG), Jart, Kato, Le Fish (standard & ultralight), Magpie, Martin Wing, Mini-DLG, Minimoa, Notos (DLG), Phase 6, Plank (wing), PSS Spitfire, Quartz, Sherpa II, Spirit 2.6, Tigger (F3F), Trapeze, Dreamflight Weasel.\n\nElectric gliders: Neoslope, trainer.\n\nPowered R/C planes: AcroBat, Extra (3D, normal and large size), F18, GeeBee R2, RT Eraser Five, Sopwith Pup, Spitfire, High-wing trainer, twin-propeller delta, Electric Kato, Yak 54.\n\nControl-line: Extra, Max Bee, Peacemaker.\n\nOther: Wasp (quadcopter), Moyes XS 142 (hang glider).\n\nYou can read a detailed review of PicaSim in the February 2013 edition of Radio Controlled Soaring Digest at www.rcsoaringdigest.com - \"PicaSim is a fantastic flight simulator ... after a short time it’s like having a real transmitter in your hands\".\n\nThe support website provides some information on how to add your own planes and sceneries to the simulator - and has a link to a forum if you have any questions/suggestions etc."

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

Players control members of the Night Chasers, a group of heroic warriors, as they embark on an adventure to save their lands from an evil threat.\n\n[Game Features]\n◆ Thrilling match-3 battle experiences\nMatch three Emblems to clear them from the board and make your heroes attack. Clear four or more to generate Magic Emblems, allowing your heroes to unleash powerful skills. Perform combos to launch even more powerful attacks and vanquish your enemies!\n\n◆ Traditional Japanese-style RPG experience\nIn a world of magic and swordplay, players will control members of the Night Chasers as they embark on an adventure together.

A exciting RPG experience is waiting for you in Hero Emblems II!\n\n◆ Substitute Heroes\nEach Hero possesses their own unique skills and backstory.

Instead of making money, these heroic warriors went around helping those in need. During the war, they helped a great many people who were suffering under tyranny and injustice. However, in the ensuing age of peace, the Night Chasers were no longer needed, and were forced to disband. Years later, four young people - Zack, Lucien, Sid, and Odelia - decided to carry on their legacy, forming the new Night Chasers.\n\nOne day, Zack and his party save an Elven girl named Dolores. Suffering from amnesia, Dolores cannot remember why she has ventured so far from the Elven Kingdom – only that she has been sent on an urgent quest. Concerned for her well-being, the Night Chasers take her into their fold, leading them to discover an ancient and terrible threat to the kingdom...\n\n** Recommend to use iPhone 6/iPad min4/iPad Air2/iPad 5th Gen./iPad Pro or later devices for better experiences.**"

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nThirty years after Freddy Fazbear's Pizza closed its doors, the events that took place there have become nothing more than a rumor and a childhood memory, but the owners of \"Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction\" are determined to revive the legend and make the experience as authentic as possible for patrons, going to great lengths to find anything that might have survived decades of neglect and ruin.\n\nAt first there were only empty shells, a hand, a hook, an old paper-plate doll, but then a remarkable discovery was made...\n\nThe attraction now has one animatronic.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

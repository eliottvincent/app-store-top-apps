      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

Tidal information is essential for navigating a shallow waterway or placing your boat at anchor.  The success or failure of a voyage can depend on the height or depth of a tide, while knowledge of current information can save fuel and make passage into a river or channel safer. \n\nTides PRO goes further than the tables provided by the NOAA. The app automatically accounts for correction factors and provides instant information without requesting that you account for time lags, daylight savings conventions, or height differences between the reference stations and the locations you are seeking. \n\nSince the tidal information that is published in this app is not subjected to the use of the voyage, please do not use for navigation."

      "label": "What time is sunset today? Or sunrise tomorrow? When is the \"magic hour\" next March 20 in Paris? With Sol, you can check times and get reminders of solar events, at home or while traveling! Great for everyone looking to plan activities based on sunlight. Use it to remind you to walk the dog before dark, get up with the sun, or find golden hour time for that perfect photo.\n\nSol: Sun Clock is the Swiss-army knife of sunlight tools with a design inspired by the simplicity of the sundial. Use it to plan your day, guide natural sleep cycles, get the best light for outdoor photography, make sure animals or kids are safe inside before dark, or to map out the best times to go running or fishing. \n\n* Be in tune: Sol will tell you when the golden hour is, how much sunlight you have left in the day or what time the next sunrise occurs.\n\n* Look to the future, travel around the world: Sol lets you find sunlight information for any date, anywhere on earth. \n \n* Find solar midnight and solar noon, and all three twilight (dawn and dusk) periods: astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight. Keep tabs on the next solstice and equinox.\n \n* Reminders and Alarms: Use Sol as a natural alarm clock that you can set to any event (like sunset, golden hour or solar noon), and the alarm or reminder time will adjust gradually as the days change with the seasons.\n \n* Automatic Location: Sol not only calculates the amount of daylight and sunrise and sunset times, but does so for any location in the world (both Northern and Southern hemispheres) by using your device's GPS... no network connection required. \n\n* Other locations: Optionally, use the built-in map to choose any location in the world by moving the pin, or search using the name of any city.\n \n* Optional location-aware alarms. Sol knows when you change with your location; and as you travel it will adjust any alarms you set relative to sunrise and sunset times.  Create alarms for multiple locations around the world.\n\n* Detailed almanac information: Useful information about the day's length, sun's azimuth and elevation, equinoxes and solstices, and a friendly glossary that explains all the terms. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. However, GPS runs in the background ONLY if you have set location-aware alarms."

      "label": "Weather Calculations is the only weather calculator you will need.  It contains 6 calculators in one: Heat Index, Wind Chill, Dew Point, Apparent Temperature, Humidex, and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature.\n\nThis calculator handles both imperial and metric units (with built-in unit converter).  Enter the air temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius.  Enter the wind speed in miles per hour, meters per second, kilometers per hour, or knots.  Many more units included!\n\nCompare various models to see which matches how you perceive the weather.  Explore what-if scenarios to better understand weather modeling.\n\n\n**Heat Index Calculator**\nHeat Index calculates the Heat Index from models by the US National Weather Service.\n\nNotes: Heat Index is defined for temperatures above 80 degrees F (27 degrees C) and relative humidity above 40%.  Calculator may not be accurate outside those ranges.\n\n\n**Wind Chill Calculator**\nWind Chill calculate the wind chill using both the new (post-2001) and old (pre-2001) Windchill Temperature (WCT) index from models by the US National Weather Service.  It also provides the old Windchill Index in kcal/m^2/h.\n\nNotes: Windchill Temperature is defined for temperatures below 50 degrees F (10 degrees C) and wind speeds above 3 mph (4.8 kph or 1.34 m/s).  Calculator may not be accurate outside those ranges.\n\n\n**Dew Point Calculator**\nUnlike some calculators which only calculate the dew point temperature, the Dew Point Calculator will also calculate the air temperature given the dew point temperature and relative humidity as well as calculate the relative humidity given the air temperature and the dew point temperature.\n\nThis calculator uses the more accurate August-Roche-Magnus model and is accurate for temperatures between 32°F (0°C) and 140°F (60°C).\n\n\n**Humidex Calculator**\nHumidex is a quick heat index calculator.  Want to know the effect of humidity on how hot it feels?\n\nHumidex calculates the humidex from models by the Meteorological Service of Canada.\n\n**Apparent Temperature Calculator**\nApparent Temperature uses the three factor model developed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which assumes a sunny day.\n\nThis advanced model works for high and low temperatures, combining the effects of humidity and wind chill into a single 'feels like' apparent temperature.\n\n\n**Wet Bulb Globe Temperature Calculator**\nWet Bulb Globe Temperature is an estimate of how hot it feels with humidity?\n\nEnter the temperature and relative humidity, and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature calculates the WBGTI describing how temperature and humidity feels.  Flag indicators help you to quickly identify the risks of outdoor activities.  These indicators are based on the system used by the USMC (see: http://www.mcrdpi.usmc.mil/weather.asp for more details).\n\nThis WBGT index calculator uses the same approximation as the Australian Bureau of Meteorology for estimating the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature from the air temperature and relative humidity, assuming sunny day and light wind.  On cloudy or windy days, this is an overestimation of how hot it feels."

      "label": "The first \"Heat Index\" tool that uses the Lans P. Rothfusz equation.\n\n[Description]\nThe heat index (HI) is an index that combines air temperature and relative humidity, in shaded areas, that is the feeling of \"hot\" or \"cold\" that is felt; it is due not only to the air temperature, but also to other environmental conditions, such as humidity and wind.\n\nThe heat index was developed in 1979 by Robert G. Steadman.\nThe computation of the heat index is a refinement of a result obtained by multiple regression analysis carried out by Lans P. Rothfusz and described in a 1990 National Weather Service (NWS) Technical Attachment (SR 90-23).\n\nThe heat index is also known as the \"felt air temperature\", \"apparent temperature\", \"real feel\" or \"feels like\".\nThe humidity in the air can increase the sensation of heat, while the wind can increase the sensation of cold.\nFor example, when the temperature is 32°C (90°F) with 70% relative humidity, the heat index is 41°C (106°F).\n\n[How does it work]\nWherever you are, you will have the Heat Index, temperature, humidity and weather conditions.\nSearch for new locations and they will automatically be added to your favorites.\nMake sure you have activated the location services on your device, at this point the App will detect your geographical position.\n\n[Features]\n- Heat Index calculated with the Rothfusz equation\n- Temperature\n- Humidity\n- Effects of the Heat Index\n- Choice of 3 units of measurement: celsius, fahrenheit and kelvin\n- Map current location\n- Search City (without limits)\n- Save favorite places (without limits)\n- Intuitive graphics\n- Ease of use\n\n[Supported languages]\nEnglish, Italian, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish.\n\n[Support]\nIf you need help please do not hesitate to contact us at info@lionsapp.com, or visit www.lionsapp.com\nIf you like the App, don't forget to leave us a comment on the App Store."

Use Radar HD to see what weather is coming your way!  \n\nRadar shows areas of current precipitation or future simulated radar prediction!. A weather radar is used to locate precipitation, calculate its motion, estimate its type (rain, snow, hail, etc.), and forecast its future position and intensity.  Precipitation type is indicated by the color. Green color indicates lesser precipitation while the yellow color code indicates intense precipitations. The color code red is indicative of the most intense precipitations. Blue color indicates snow.\n\nUsing the data from Storm Prediction Center and Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (SPC & GDAC) Radar HD provides information about tropical storms and hurricanes for locations worldwide, areas affected by storms and severe weather, coordinates and wind speed, storm tracks & path projections.\n\nSatellite images provide an excellent view on the clouds in the sky and an indication of the weather over the United states, Europe, Japan, Australia and Indonesia.\nSatellite images come from satellites which remain above a fixed point on the Earth (i.e. they are “geostationary”). Lighter areas of cloud show where the cloud tops are cooler and therefore where weather features like fronts and shower clouds are.\n\nThe app also allows you to check the weather on your favorite places on maps. Interactive map includes live international weather conditions, local weather and time, ten-day forecasts and sunrise/sunset times for multiple places. You can add placemarks on the map to represent your favorite places or the places you’d like to visit. At a glance you can see the time and weather for all of your favorites.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n* [NEW] Predictive weather radar \n* [NEW] Simulated radar prediction for the next 60 minutes using five-minute intervals\n* The real time radar images provided by NEXRAD an accurate view of the weather situation in the U.S.\n* Storm / hurricane / typhoon tracker and projected paths (International and Global)\n* All severe weather alerts on interactive map, 126 weather alert types (U.S.)\n* High resolution weather radar.

It benefits from an interface derived from the “Routing & Navigation” version.\n\nWeather\nGFS model is provided by default.  In addition, over 35 weather and oceanographic models are available with a yearly subscription (in-app purchase). Queries and downloads are fully customizable.\n\nThe application makes it possible to create your own geographical zones and to select the characteristics of the GRIB files to download: choice of data, resolution, periodicity, file size, etc. GRIB files can be downloaded wherever you are from our servers through a regular or satellite internet connection.\n\nWeather4D Routing displays the combined data as layered layers. All the data of a selected model is displayed by an animation in continuous time scrolling or in manual scrolling on the map.\n\nThe weather forecast is displayed in one or two windows (iPad only), offering several display combinations of the same area: navigation and weather, weather and waves or currents, comparison of different models. The two windows can be disassociated for displaying the same area at different scales.\n\nRouting\nWeather4D Routing makes it possible to optimize sailing or engine, or mixed sail-engine routes. From a theoretical route, a routing algorithm will take into account wind force and wave height constraints.  When sailing, the boat polar combined with wind and current forecasts will be used to optimize performance, comfort and safety.\n\nSeveral routes can be displayed to compare the outcome of different options: different forecast patterns, departure dates and times, selected constraint values. The routing can be restarted at any moment during  navigation from the actual position of the boat.\n\nDefault Models and Charts\n————————————\nGFS global forecast model at 0.25 °, 0.5 °, 1 ° and 2 ° resolutions. \nBING global chart\nOSM (Opens Street Map) global chart\n\nOptional Models (in-app purchase):\n———————————————————\nWeather\n--------\nNAM USA    \nGEM Global    \nCOAMPS Europe, West Atlantic, Central America, East Pacific    \nICON-EU Europe    \nARPEGE Global, Europe    \nAROME France, Antilles, Guyane, Polynésie, Calédonie, Indien  \nAROME HD France\nWRF France, Europe, Greece, NW Africa, Azores, Lesser Antilles, Greater Antilles    \n\nWaves\n-------\nMFWAM Global, Europe, France\nFNMOC WW3 Global, Europe\n\nCurrents\n---------\nMyOcean Global, IBI, NWS, Baltic, Med\nNCOM AMSEAS, USEAST, ALASKA, SOCAL, HAWAII"

      "label": "Weather forecasts and radar for weather nerds!\n\n*****\nFeatured by Apple, MacRumors, CNet, App Advice and more!  \"Weather Nerd is a comprehensive package in a gorgeous wrapper.\"\n*****\n\nWHAT'S NEW?\n\n - Optimized for All Sizes of Devices\n - Siri Support\n - Bolder, Larger Text\n - Tons of New Measurements Like Humidity, Pressure, etc\n - Forecasts for Your Calendar Events\n\nTOP FEATURES\n\n - Detailed daily reports (up to a year out)\n - Minute-to-minute precipitation (see coverage below)\n - Weather radar and satellite\n - 3 widgets (next hour, day, week)\n\nPurchase includes one year full access. After a year, you can renew via an in-app purchase. \n\n########################################\n\nCOVERAGE\n\nWeather reports are available for nearly anywhere in the world. If in doubt, go to http://darksky.net and try your location to see if you like the report.\n\nRadar is currently North America only.\n\nThe hour forecast is currently limited to US, UK, Ireland.\n\n\nDAILY COMPARISON\n\nWhen you're getting dressed, what do you want to know?\n\n\"How does today compare with yesterday?\"\n\nWeather Nerd includes a nice daily comparison:\n\n\"Today is 9° cooler than yesterday. No rain.\"\n\nThis makes it easy to grab the right coat.\n\n\nMINUTE-TO-MINUTE FORECAST\n\nWeather Nerd also gives you minute-by-minute rain predictions for your exact GPS location. Powered by Dark Sky's cutting edge \"hyperlocal precipitation forecasting system\", these reports show you a nice graph of the rain intensity for the next hour based on your exact location.  For example, you might see:\n\n\"Light rain starting in 10 minutes, stopping 15 minutes later.\"\n\n\nDAILY FORECAST\n\nThe daily forecast screen shows you a graph of the temperature, rain, and wind for today. Touch anywhere on the graph to view the forecast for a specific time. See more details at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\nWEEKLY FORECAST\n\nThe weekly forecast shows you a quick graph of the projected highs and lows for the next week, along with the chance of rain. Touch any day to view the full forecast for that day.\n\n\nBEYOND 7 DAYS\n\nNeed to see the forecast for two weeks or two months out? No problem. Weather Nerd's calendar lets you view the forecast for any date within the next year. \n\n\nNERD OUT\n\nFor the real weather nerds, the \"Nerd Out\" feature will list out ALL of the weather information.\n\n\nNERD ALERTS\n\nWeather Nerd lets you setup a daily weather forecast alert (in 15 minute intervals). You can turn the alert on/off for certain days of the week.\n\nIf you set your alert to 6pm or later, then the forecast will be for \"tomorrow's\" weather.\n\n\nNERD WIDGETS\n\nSome of you nerds like to use iPhone and iPad widgets. No problem. Weather Nerd comes packaged with 3 different widgets for your viewing pleasure including graphs for the \"Next Hour\", \"Today\", and \"Week\".\n\n\n========================\n\nWhy a subscription? The average nerd checks weather 4-5 times a day. Over a year, that alone cost nearly 1 USD to our providers. That's not counting additional data used for radar tiles, alerts, widgets, multiple devices, servers, etc. It would be completely unsustainable to charge a one time fee for a lifetime of data.\n\nWeather Nerd uses auto-renewing subscriptions. The Nerd Club subscription provides full access to weather reports, radar, widgets, and notifications. The subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase within the app. Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of your subscription period and will be charged through your iTunes account. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings. Cancellation of the current active subscription period is not allowed. \n\nTerms of Use: http://www.allstarapps.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy Policy:  http://www.allstarapps.com/privacy-policy"

This app lets you determine what levels of radiation are being reported at various locations around the world. You can scroll around the map and zoom in on readings. Readings are continuously updated every few minutes. \n\nIt displays the current ionizing radiation reading from these detectors on an easy to use world map, in uR/hr, one of the standard units of measurement for radiation. You can scroll around and zoom in to your area. Typical background (naturally occurring) radiation values near sea level are in the 10 to 20 uR/hr range. Higher readings naturally occur at higher elevations due to cosmic rays from outer space.\n\nTapping on one of the readings will bring up a chart of the last few days worth of readings. You can even smooth out the variations by adjusting the number of samples averaged per plotted point, to bring out subtle variations. \n\nBuy a copy of Radiation Map Tracker, and you'll never be in the dark about nuclear radiation levels again."

      "label": "************************************* \nFind all the photovoltaic data you need for your location. \n***********\nWhen you input coordinates manually, they have to be in decimal format. \nIf unsure, get coordinates from google maps. \n************\n\"This iPad and iPhone app is a comprehensive tool intended to help solar professionals calculate basically all aspects of a photovoltaic array. This includes weather information like clear sky days, hourly angle of the sun throughout the year and more.\n\nIt doesn’t stop there, though. The app generates information on the size of system you’ll need and how many panels would be in it. It also calculates what the size a battery backup would have to be for a proposed system. The app also includes a guide and a glossary where users can get more information.\n\nBasically, it’s like having a solar engineer at your fingertips.\" --cleanenergyauthority.com\n******\nThis is an application for professionals of the photovoltaic/solar panel industry. PV Master is essential to any person in the field who needs relevant information always available. \nWeather you’re a construction company/panel installer or serious DIY enthusiast this app will satisfy all your needs and requirements when it comes to setting up a green energy system. The sun is the future and with this app you can make it happen yourself. \n\nThe application is divided into 5 sections: \nData \nHere you have all the indeces you will ever need * explicitly for your current coordinates * (such as number of clear sky days, insolation incident, hourly solar angle relative to horizon, battery sizing and deficits, frequency of near-overcast skies, frost days average, average wind direction and speed, average monthly precipitation and pressure and much much more). \n\nGuide \nIf you’re a DIY look for home improvement or simply “getting started” in this field, here you will find a general guide with the necessary steps and considerations to be made when setting up a photovoltaic panel system. \n\nPannel Calc \nThe most frequently asked questions we face when looking into the feasability of sun as energy is “how many panels will I need?”. Thanks to this app the big question is easily answered. Gather the data from the first section and your current electricity bills, input the values and you’re done. Then it’s up to you to decide weather you wish to do it or not... \n\nBattery Calc \nIf you’re serious about going green then you definitely have to account for everything. The sun is always there but we all know there are many variables that might disrupt our “fuel”. For this reason we need to also account for batteries and surplus storage to evoid wasting potential energy and also not be “stuck” when during the colder season. Again, just gather data, insert it in the easy fields and you’re down. You know everything about kind, capacity and quantity of batteries you need. \n\nGlossary \nThis is another great section essential for any starter (although even experts will surely learn something form it). A collection of A-Z terms related to this this topic. You can jump to a certain letter if you wish to find something out otherwise just scrolling through it to educate yourself is a great way of spending time. \n\nAdditional Info \nOn startup, the app requests your location and fetches the specific data for the entire first section. This is on actual coordinates, not just state or city...pinpoint! \nEvery successful data fetch gets stored locally (no need to worry about privacy) so that if the next time you open the app there is no internet connection (perhaps you’re “on-site”) you will still have the everything available."

Smartphones are able to detect earthquakes thanks to the accelerometer on-board each device. When an earthquake is detected, users with the application installed are immediatly alerted. Since earthquake waves travel at around 5 km/s it is possible to alert the population not yet reached by the damaging waves of the earthquake. For the scientific details about the project please refer to the scientific paper on Frontiers at https://bit.ly/2C8B5HI\n\nSubscriptions:\n\nWhen an earthquake is detected in real time by smartphones near the epicenter, the server sends an alert to all users with the app. Alerting all users can take up to 10 seconds since it is not technically feasible to do so instantly. Now you can join the priority lists of the first 10,000 or 100,000 people alerted in real time. The following subscriptions are available:\n\n- Subscription 10k for 1 year\n- Subscription 10k for 1 month \n\n- Subscription 100k for 1 year\n- Subscription 100k for 1 month \n\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nPrivacy: https://www.sismo.app/privacy\n\nTerms and conditions: https://www.sismo.app/terms-conditions"

This is why I created Minimalistic Weather App. I wanted, no needed, a weather app that's not cluttered with unnecessary stuff.\n\nThe app is simple and has a beautiful minimalistic design that only shows you what you want and what you need. The app is ad-free so you have no distractions that annoy you or drains your batteries.\n\nDesign\nThe beautiful and minimalistic design makes it easy for you to get the information you need and move along with your day. I have included a variety of minimalistic color themes so that you can personalize the app.\n\nFunctionality\nTo keep the app minimalistic I have carefully chosen the information that is displayed and the functionalities. You can either get the current weather information in your location or in any other city by searching for it. By double-tapping, on the screen, you’ll switch between showing the temperatures in Celsius or in Fahrenheit. The unit of measurement that you have chosen will be saved and synced to the widget and iMessage extension.\n\nThe information that is giving to you are:\n   - Current temperature\n   - Daily forecast\n   - Hourly  forecast\n   - Min & max temperature\n   - Time of sunrise & sunset\n   - The weather type\n   - 7-Day forecast\n   - 12 and 24-Hour timezones\n   - Both Celsius & Fahrenheit as temperature units\n\nWidget:\n- The app provides a small, beautiful, and simple widget where you can get the current weather info at a glance.\n\nThank you for choosing Minimalistic Weather App, I will keep releasing updates so if something isn’t working properly I will fix it!"

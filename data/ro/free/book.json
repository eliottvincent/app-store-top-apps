Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

      "label": "Biblia Română (Romanian Holy Bible)\nCornilescu (1921)\nDumitru Cornilescu (n. 4 aprilie 1891, comuna Slașoma, județul Mehedinți - d. 1975, Elveția) a fost ierodiacon și autor al unei traduceri în limba română a Bibliei, publicată în 1921, traducere care este în prezent cea mai răspândită traducere în rândul confesiunilor protestante (inclusiv cele neoprotestante).\nBiblia (din lb. greacă βιβλίον, pl. βιβλία -cărți) se referă la scripturile sacre din iudaism și creștinism. Aceste scripturi sunt compilații ale unor documente separate (numite „cărți”) scrise într-un interval de timp de circa 1000 de ani. Numai Vechiul Testament are circa 100-150 scriitori diferiți, provenind din intelectualitatea aflată în serviciul conducătorilor politici. Cărțile sale au fost publicate separat și adunate în secolele I-II e.n. pentru a forma prima Biblie ebraică, Tanach, iar mai târziu, cu adăugiri, Biblia creștină, numită de creștini și Sfânta Scriptură.\nPrima parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Vechiul Testament (din grecescul \"palaia diathékè\"). Vechiul Testament reprezintă în mare traducerea grecească (sau din aceasta în alte limbi) a textului sacru ebraic așa cum era el prin secol II î.e.n. O împărțire cu origine evreiască pe criterii funcționale a Vechiului Testament îl împarte pe acesta în Legea (\"Legea lui Moise\", \"Pentateucul\", adică primele \"cinci cărți\" ale Bibliei), Profeții și Scrierile Sfinte. A doua parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Noul Testament.\nPrima traducere integrală a Bibliei în limba română a fost tipărită în 1688. Biblia a cunoscut mai multe traduceri în limba română. Denominațiile neoprotestante folosesc traducerea Bibliei în limba română de Dumitru Cornilescu, cu sau fără explicații. De remarcat că traducerea Cornilescu a fost inițial acceptată de Biserica Ortodoxă, prima traducere a lui Dumitru Cornilescu a apărut cu binecuvântarea patriarhului României, fiind ulterior respinsă de Biserica Ortodoxă (după ce preotul Dumitru Cornilescu a început să dea învățături specifice cultelor evanghelice cum ar fi îndreptățirea prin credință), dar folosită de Oastea Domnului și de confesiunile neoprotestante. Criticii din vremea publicării ei au considerat-o „net superioară oricărei alte traduceri, fiind prezentată într-o limbă suplă și curgătoare, care lipsește oricărei alte traduceri; fiind expusă într-o limbă care vorbește înseși inimilor oamenilor”. Biserica Ortodoxă Română a generat, la rândul ei, mai multe traduceri de-a lungul timpului, fie integrale fie parțiale, a Sfintei Scripturi, e.g., Biblia „Carol al II-lea”, Palia de la Orăștie, „Biblia pe versuri tocmită”."

You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "Book Track is an iPhone, iPad, and Mac app that can track your books — both the ones you own and the ones you hope to own in the future.\n\nAvid readers know how difficult it can be to keep tabs on a growing book collection and that's where Book Track comes into its own by making it quicker and easier than ever to track your reading. Not only can you track all of the books that you own, as well as how far you've read, but you can also keep a wishlist of the books that you'd like to pick up in the future. Whether a book is in your 'Library' or your 'Wishlist,' Book Track displays information and gorgeous cover art for all of them. While Book Track uses information from the internet, more obscure books can also be added manually, too.\n\nBook Track is a free app and is limited to 5 books. A single in-app purchase unlocks support for unlimited books across iPhone and iPad. A separate purchase is required to unlock the full Mac app.\n\nBook Track users can look forward to:\n\n- A synchronized list of books and information — whether you save a book on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, it'll be synced across all devices. Both your Library and Wishlist will be synced seamlessly and automatically so you'll never lose a book again — or buy the same book twice because you forgot you already own it!\n\n- Easy and comprehensive book organization — Every book you add to your Library can be marked as read, reading, or unread, with each book also supporting tags to help you find similar books throughout your collection. Book information like title, author, description, publisher, year of publication, genre, and even the description can also be edited to make your Library as accurate or personal as possible.\n\n- Quote saving — Find a passage within a book that you want to save for later? Book Track can save your favorite quotes in one place so you can read them again later. You can even put them on your Home screen using a widget.\n\n- All the stats, right where you'll see them — Book Track collects library and reading statistics and puts them right on your Home screen with gorgeous widgets. iPad users can enjoy an extra large widget with even more stats, too!\n\n- Support for importing books from services like Goodreads, BookBuddy, Reading List, and more — It's never been easier to import your books from other apps and services so you don't have to start building your library all over again. Book collections can also be exported to PDF and CSV as well.\n\n- Deep integration with iOS and macOS — Book Track includes support for the latest Apple features including Shortcuts and Siri, while Widgets can be used to put your favorite quotes right onto your Home screen.\n\n- Privacy — Book Track doesn't collect any of your personal data and doesn't track you in any way. Books should be fun, not another reason to worry about your data privacy."

Just spend a few minutes to voice-over the story.\n\nLet love and kindness fill your family’s leisure time to make your life and the world around you happier!\n\nWhy “Little Stories”?\n• 1800+ pictures\n• Gender determines the choice of illustrations\n• 45 exciting fairy tales so far and more to come\n• Enchanting music accompanies each story\n• You can create audiobooks by recording your own voice!\n• 1st place in the “Entertainment” category of Rating Runet in 2018!\n• 1st place in the “App For Kids” category of Golden App in 2016!\n• 3rd place in the “Entertainment” category of Golden App in 2017!\n\nWe’d like to tell you more about the process behind creating stories for kids so that you have a better idea about the hard work we put into “Little Stories”.\n\n1) It all begins with searching for an author. He/she can live in any country of the world, but the important thing is that he/she is able to create an interesting and insightful story. Before writing a bedtime story, the author has to read the conditions first. For example, the story may not contain more than 50 scenes (each of which can consist of 146 symbols max.) otherwise the text won’t fit into the app. Once the story has been completed, the next stage can begin.\n\n2) It is now  time to create the storyboard. A storyboard is a selection of simple sketches for each of the illustrations of the story. It gives us a better idea about the visual images of the children’s story.\n\n3) Once the storyboard has been approved, we move on to searching for an illustrator. It should be noted that not all styles might be appropriate for a certain bedtime story and, therefore, it’s important to achieve a perfect fit between the story and the illustration style.\n\n4) Meanwhile, the composer creates the melody. Both the story itself and the artist’s illustrations serve as inspiration for the creation of music. The composer also has conditions to meet: the melody must be soothing and prepare children for a good night’s sleep since most often stories are read for bedtime.\n\n5) What’s more, we also translate our stories for kids into other languages.\n\n6) But that’s not the end! It’s important to see how the book for kids looks inside the app. Line breaks should be checked to make sure the text looks nice and neat. This is done by two professionals: the programmer and the tester.\n\n7) Only after this final step do we release the story for kids. This entire process might take anywhere from two to nine months. So, it’s a hard, but interesting, journey!\n\nWe continuously add new fairy tales to our collection! \nFairy tales are designed for kids aged 3+.\n\nFollow us on: facebook.com/diveomedia"

      "label": "Creepy texts, scary stories, skin crawling tales of horror – there’s no escape from the paralyzing fear of yOwl, a collection of terrifying texts that will chill you to the bone and leave you hooked, screaming for more.\n\nWhat would you do if your phone began to send you texts from the dead? Could you reply? Would you believe your eyes?\n\nHow would you react if your best friend sent you a message claiming they were being chased by a blood-thirsty maniac intent on slaying them in the street? \n\nyOwl brings together a collection of spine-chilling stories that will make the hairs on the back of your stand on end. Read the horrifying story of Ray, haunted by messages from the grave, as his father reaches out to him from the depths of Hell. Fear for your own life as you follow the gruesome text instructions that David followed, they lead to a shallow grave for one poor soul. Tag along with Joe as his love for street art and graffiti leads to death and destruction. Read Hal’s harrowing texts – has his phone been hacked or has his past finally caught up with him?\n\nyOwl reaches out from the other side and pulls you in, dragging you kicking and screaming into the bowels of Hell to feed you to the Beast. These stories are not for the feint-hearted, they’re not bedtime reading and they shouldn’t be read alone. yOwl will take you into the lives of the scarred and tortured, part the curtains on their windows and reveal to you their inner secrets – each and every one of them has a story to tell and every story has a very, very unhappy ending.\n\nFor fans of horror and fantastic fiction, yOwl feeds you addictive stories told through a series of text messages between the characters involved. Read on as friends’ happy, emoji filled messages turn sour, the blood splashes over their screens, their fingers dig into the touch screen keyboards as their knuckles turn white with fear. \n\nyOwl aims to keep you awake at nights with its phantasmagorial tales, filled with monsters from other dimensions, evil dead roadkill, insane killers, spurned lovers, violent psychopaths and things that even we can’t explain.\n\nUpdated weekly with more and more freaky tales and blood-curdling chronicles written by blood-loving, crazed writers who we only let out of their cages when they’ve scared the pants off the boss, it’s our mission to frighten you so bad you’ll never be able to sleep with the light off again!\n\nIn texts, no one can hear you scream.\n\nYou can unlock all yOwl chat stories, via auto-renewable subscription: \nwe offer three auto-renewing subscription options: weekly subscription, monthly subscription, annual subscription.\nBy subscribing you get unlimited access to all original scary chat stories, images and videos.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew at the end of each term and your credit card will be charged through your iTunes account.\nYou can turn off auto-renew at any time from your account settings but refunds will not be provided for any unused portion of the term.\nYour account will be charged according to your plan for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\nIf you wish to avoid auto-renewal you must turn it off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period in your Account Settings.\nPrivacy policy and Terms of Use Page:\nhttps://yowl.stefrasoft.com\nhttps://yowl.stefrasoft.com/terms/privacy-policy"

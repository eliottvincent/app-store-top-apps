It is reading the universe, the major book of creation, and making sense out of it by way of the manual of Divine guidance. The Fountain is an effort to try and see the reality through the veils of apparent causes and to obtain our share from each phenomenon, each of which is a letter enclosed with a message addressing us.\n\nPayment for subscription will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

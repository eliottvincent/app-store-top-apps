      "label": "Welcome to iRobot magazine!\n\nIf you think robots are mainly the stuff of space movies, think again. Right now, all over the world, robots are on the move. They’re painting cars at Ford plants, assembling Milano cookies for Pepperidge Farms, walking into live volcanoes, driving trains in Paris, and defusing bombs in Northern Ireland. As they grow tougher, nimbler, and smarter, today’s robots are doing more and more things we can’t –or don’t want to–do.\n\nRobots have been with us for less than 50 years, but the idea of inanimate creations to do our bidding is much, much older. The ancient Greek poet Homer described maidens of gold, metallic helpers for the Hephaistos, the Greek god of the forge. The golems of medieval Jewish legend were robot-like servants made of clay, brought to life by a spoken charm. Leonardo da Vinci drew plans for a mechanical man in 1495.\n\nBut real robots wouldn’t become possible until the 1950’s and 60’s, with the invention of transistors and integrated circuits. Compact, reliable electronics and a growing computer industry added brains to the brawn of already existing machines. In 1959, researchers demonstrated the possibility of robotic manufacturing when they unveiled a computer-controlled milling machine. Its first product: ashtrays.\n\nThis is a free app with paid content within.The terms are as follows:\n\nFree Trial For 7 Days and The $1.99 per month per active subscription\n\nThe subscription will renew automatically unless cancelled more than 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for the product.\n\nYou may turn off the auto-renewal of subscriptions through your Account Settings, however you are not able to cancel the current subscription during its active period.\n\nPayment will charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when a subscription to that publication is purchased.\n\nSubscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase\n\nUsers can register for/ login to account in-app. This will protect their issues in the case of a lost device and allow browsing of purchases on multiple platforms.

      "label": "Philosophy Now is a magazine for everyone interested in ideas. It aims to corrupt innocent citizens by convincing them that philosophy can be exciting, worthwhile and comprehensible, and also to provide some light and enjoyable reading matter for those already ensnared by the muse, such as philosophy students and academics.\n\nPhilosophy Now appears every two months. It contains articles on all aspects of Western philosophy, as well as book reviews, letters, news, cartoons, and the occasional short story.\n\nSince its small-scale launch in Britain in 1991, Philosophy Now has grown to become the most widely-read philosophy periodical in the English language. Philosophy Now is independent of all groups and has no intentional editorial bias except for a passionate conviction that philosophy is a Good Thing.\n\nAPP FEATURES\n\n• Subscriptions and all back issues available using In-App Purchase.\n• Freely browse the contents list of any issue before purchasing.\n• Purchased issues can be downloaded to device for reading without internet connection.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION OPTIONS\n\n• Subscribe annually (6 issues) for USD $24.99 or bimonthly (1 issue) for USD $4.99.\n• Single issues are also available for USD $5.99 each.\n• If available you will be charged in your local currency at the prevailing exchange rate as defined by iTunes.\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• App subscription is independent of and not included with print or any other type of subscription to the magazine.\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the price of the original subscription.\n• You can manage auto-renew of your subscription in your iTunes account settings, where it can be turned off if you wish.\n• No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.\n• Full Privacy Policy and Terms of Use can be found at http://philosophynow.org/terms"

      "label": "Decibel is an extremely extreme music and entertainment magazine based out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 2004 by a well-intentioned, somewhat studious (let’s not forget record-collecting) dude, Decibel’s credo was to examine and expose the best extreme music had to offer. We were the new kid on the block, but we knew our noise was louder and nastier than anything out there. To quote ourselves, Decibel was “the new noise.” Since our debut issue (the Dillinger Escape Plan, October 2004), Decibel went from the quiet longhair with the Entombed \"Left Hand Path\" T-shirt to the Grand Pontificator of all things metal. Now, when we speak, people listen. Maybe they heckle. But, nearly nine years later, Decibel is America’s only monthly metal magazine.\n==================================\nThe magazine offers a yearly (24.99$) and monthly (14.99$) auto-renewable subscription \n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase \n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n==================================\nThis magazine is proudly powered by PressPad.\nTerms of Use and Privacy Policy: https://presspadapp.com/terms-apps/"

Tout simplement.\n\n• SOFILM est un pari. Celui de raconter le cinéma dans un magazine que l'on ne feuillette pas mais qu'on lit, que l'on garde, et même que l'on prête.\n\n• Hors-série de Society, DOOLITTLE est le guide familial ultime, indispensable pour devenir le meilleur parent du monde.\n\n• THE RUNNING HEROES SOCIETY raconte toutes les histoires de ces hommes et femmes qui courent partout dans le monde.\n\n• PÉDALE! est né d’une envie de raconter le cyclisme à la façon SO FOOT : avec du cœur, de la sueur, quelques larmes et pas mal de souvenirs d’enfance.\n\n• TAMPON!, parce qu’un sport n’est jamais qu’un prétexte pour raconter des histoires, se marrer, réfléchir et voyager où le ballon vous mène, surtout avec un rebond imprévisible."

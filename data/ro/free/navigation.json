      "label": "In Iasi si Oradea aplicatia foloseste date reale de la regionala de transport. \nAceasta aplicatie iti permite sa vezi mijloacele de transport in comun puse pe harta de ceilalti calatori. Pentru o buna functionare trebuie facuta o promovare masiva in fiecare oras, momentan suntem in procesul de promovare in Iasi, urmand Bucuresti si apoi celelalte orase, deci la incepul este de asteptat sa vedeti putine autobuze. Asteptati promovarea in orasul dumneavoastra inainte sa aveti asteptarea sa fie multe autobuze pe harta.\n\nInstalati aplicatia pentru a vedea pe harta in timp real mijloacele de transport in comun din Iasi (si din celelalte mari orase alea tarii: Alba, Arad, Brasov, Bucuresti, Cluj, Constanta, Craiova, Iasi, Oradea, Ploiesti, Sibiu, Timisoara, in curand si Bacau).\n\nPrincipiul de functionare se baseaza pe inputul comunitatii de calatori, fiecare utilizator avand sansa de a vedea informatiile despre mijloacele de transport in comun, dar in acelasi timp este sarcina noastra a tuturor sa sharuim informatiile despre mijloacele de transport cu care calatorim. In acest mod, aplicatia nu depinde de nici un fel de hardware special (GPS-uri pe autobuze sau servere ale regiilor de transport in comun etc), folosind intr-un mod util ceea ce cu totii avem in ziua de astazi (smartphone-ul).\n\n\nPentru a folosi aplicatia NU este necesar nici un fel de autentificare, este gratuita, momentan nu are nici reclame care sa deranjeze, singura conditie pentru a folosi aplicatia este sa fim solidari unii cu ceilalti si sa \"sharuim\" informatii despre locatia autobuzelor.\n\nDin punct de vedere technic, proiectul nostru are in spate platforma Firebase pentru a putea avea functionalitatea de update in timp real a pozitiilor mijloacelor de transport in comun.\n\nInterfata aplicatiei consta intr-o harta a orasului nostru, un cerc de 1km, o componenta de cautare si un buton.\nPractic incarcam pe harta doar mijloacele de transport in comun de pe o raza de un 1km fata de locatia mea curenta, desigur daca dorim sa vedem si dincolo de aceasta distanta putem folosi componenta de \"Cautare\", toate mijloacele de transport in comun selectate prin acea componenta devin vizibile pe harta necontand distanta fata de locatia mea. Putem defini un numar limitat momentan la 2 route \"favorite\", acestea vor fi vizibile pe harta pe toata suprafata orasului la incarcarea aplicatiei.\nPentru a sharui locatia unui mijloc de transport avem 2 cazuri:\n1. Daca autobuzul/tramvaiul cu care intentionez sa plec nu a fost inca sharuit de altcineva ne harta, apas butonul verde -> \"Am plecat\", apoi din lista afisata selectez ruta dorita si directia de deplasare printr-un slide stanga sau dreapta. \n2. Daca autobuzul a fost deja sharuit, dau click pe el si apas \"Am plecat\"\n\nAplicatia face validari si nu permite sharuirea de informatii decat daca userul se afla pe traseul mijlocului de transport respectiv.\nCand sharuim locatia unui mijloc de transport cu optiunea \"Am plecat\"  aplicatia incepe sa ia recurent locatia userului curent, cu functionalitatea \"Am vazut\" dau voi aplicatiei sa-mi ia o singura data locatia. \nOdata sharuita locatia unui autobuz userul nu este nevoit neaparat sa stea cu aplicatia pornita, poate inchide ecranul telefonului sau poate comuta catre orice alta aplicatie doreste (desigur cu conditia sa tina in background aplicatia HereItIs).\n\nAplicatia Necesita urmatoarele drepturi de accces:\n- Accessul la locatia curenta (atat cand aplicatia e deschisa cat si cand e in background)\n\nO prezentare a aplicatiei puteti gasi aici: https://storage.googleapis.com/here-it-is/public/Romania/Prezentare_HEREITIS.pdf"

      "label": "CT BUS APPLICATION\n\nCT Bus application is a travel platform offered by CTBUS S.A.. In the application all the actions necessary to facilitate the use of public transport can be performed.\nThe application allows the purchase of travel tickets using the bank card or the electronic wallet, the calculation of the optimal route for the passenger and the visualization of lines, stations and means of transport in real time on the map.\nAfter creating an account and associating it with a transport card, the user can recharge the card with travel tickets directly in the application, using online payment by bank card or electronic wallet. The user can check the status of the card and the active travel tickets at any given time.\nA user can manage several transport cards on a single account and can perform actions of recharging the respective cards, whether it is the recharge of the electronic wallet, the purchase of new subscriptions or the extension of the existing ones.\nAfter performing the various purchase/validation/control actions, the user will have the possibility of viewing a detailed history of transactions.\nUsers who benefit from subsidies in accordance with the legislation in force will be able to request the approval of a subsidized profile directly from the application by sending supporting documents. Following the approval of such a profile from the application or from the ticket point, users will be able to purchase/request, directly from the application, travel tickets with discount or free of charge.\nLegal entities that have a collaboration with the transport administration will be able to manage their card portfolio directly from the web portal or the mobile application.\nWhen purchasing a travel ticket, when it is approaching its expiration date or when other actions are performed on the card, the user can choose to receive push notifications or e-mails.\nThe application provides the traveler with the means to find the optimal route between the starting point A and the arrival point B, using the locations of the vehicles on the route.\nThe traveler can start the journey from the current location or from another location on the map and can choose their destination by looking for an address, a point of interest, a desired station or even placing a pin on the map. They can also choose a location they have previously searched for or added to favorites.\nThe application shows how long it will take to get to the nearest station, when the vehicle will arrive at the station and how long the trip will take.\nIt gives the traveler the possibility of saving frequently used locations on a designated menu page or when searching for those locations on the main page. Thus, the user can start a much faster and easier route in the future.\nThe application will display in real time the vehicle that the passenger must take and will notify them when they must change the line.\nThe user can view on the map the complete route of a line or just a direction of the route and can save the favorite lines. They will receive a message when a problem occurs with one of them if that problem could affect their trip.\nOn the page dedicated to lines, they can search for the desired line and then view on the map, in real time, the vehicles on one direction of that line.\nThey can select a station on the main page or on the route of a line, and thus can see all the lines that stop at that station and what the arrival times are for each line. They can see the next three times and the schedule for all the lines in that station.\nTicket points of the transport administration can be found on the map. By selecting such a point the user can see its operating schedule.\nThe application is available in Romanian and English, depending on the language set in the device used."

      "label": "Atlas Navi is a Drive to Earn A.I. navigation app that uses live video from your smartphone camera to analyze the road in front of you and automatically detect: \n- traffic in each lane (counting how many vehicles are in each lane in front of you) \n- road construction / road work signs \n- road closures \n- accident detection \n- police vehicles (some countries only) \n- potholes \n- available / free parking space\n\nThe app uses advanced computer vision (A.I.) algorithms to analyze the video feeds from your smartphone camera and detect all the above problems on the road. It does this in the background, without interfering with the navigation instructions. \n\nAtlas Navi analyses the road 25 times per second when used with the camera from your smartphone. It generates 100 times better data than other navigation systems, which helps reroute other drivers to avoid potential traffic congestion and dangerous situations. \nBased on these A.I. detections, the app reroutes other drivers on quicker, safer, and less congested routes. \n\nAtlas Navi only uploads to the server the relevant information for traffic optimization: the type of detections and the GPS co-ordinates of said problem. No images or videos are uploaded unless specifically enabled by the user. If enabled, it can store your road trip recorded videos in the cloud, but the default option is to keep them on your device. \nAtlas Navi rewards drivers who send traffic data with a small amount of $NAVI for each mile they drive if they have a 3D vehicle selected in the app and provide traffic data from their cameras.\n\nYou can of course use Atlas Navi as a standard navigation app, without turning on the smartphone camera or the A.I. detections. You will benefit from all the rerouting and information received from other drivers which will make your route safer and faster. \n\nCurrent features include: \n- Navigation module with very accurate address search function \n- Video recording of your road trips, stored in the cloud or on the device \n- Trip history with associated videos (if any) \n- A.I. camera view - see what the camera is detecting in real time around you. \n- Livestream your road trip by sharing a simple link (the others don't need to download Atlas Navi) \n- Car garage where you can select from 3D vehicles in your garage. Customize, change their color, and choose which one you want to drive with today. \n- Rewards system - get rewarded in $NAVI if others join your Driving Club \n- Driving Club - see the others who have joined your personal club \n- Wallet - rewards earned and spent\n\nAtlas Navi is adding more features on a bi-weekly basis and will keep you updated with the latest innovation in avoiding traffic using A.I."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

Following the approval of such a profile from the application or from the ticket point, users will be able to purchase/request, directly from the application, travel tickets with discount or free of charge.\nLegal entities that have a collaboration with the transport administration will be able to manage their card portfolio directly from the web portal or the mobile application.\nWhen purchasing a travel ticket, when it is approaching its expiration date or when other actions are performed on the card, the user can choose to receive push notifications or e-mails.\nThe application provides the traveler with the means to find the optimal route between the starting point A and the arrival point B, using the locations of the vehicles on the route.\nThe traveler can start the journey from the current location or from another location on the map and can choose their destination by looking for an address, a point of interest, a desired station or even placing a pin on the map. They can also choose a location they have previously searched for or added to favorites.\nThe application shows how long it will take to get to the nearest station, when the vehicle will arrive at the station and how long the trip will take.\nIt gives the traveler the possibility of saving frequently used locations on a designated menu page or when searching for those locations on the main page. Thus, the user can start a much faster and easier route in the future.\nThe application will display in real time the vehicle that the passenger must take and will notify them when they must change the line.\nThe user can view on the map the complete route of a line or just a direction of the route and can save the favorite lines. They will receive a message when a problem occurs with one of them if that problem could affect their trip.\nOn the page dedicated to lines, they can search for the desired line and then view on the map, in real time, the vehicles on one direction of that line.\nThey can select a station on the main page or on the route of a line, and thus can see all the lines that stop at that station and what the arrival times are for each line. They can see the next three times and the schedule for all the lines in that station.\nTicket points of the transport administration can be found on the map. By selecting such a point the user can see its operating schedule.\nThe application is available in Romanian and English, depending on the language set in the device used."

Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under \"Settings / Advanced settings\" in iOS 7."

It's easy and is just one click away. Another unique feature is the intelligent route planning, where the DKV Mobility App automatically calculates the best route with optimal charging stops for long distances.\n\nNeed to find a station quickly?\n\nWith our new home screen, you have instant access to the station closest to you. You can check the price and start navigation right away.\n\nActively managing time windows in which the DKV CARD can be used?\n\nThe activation mode \"on demand\" offers the possibility to activate cards only for the period in which they are used for a transaction. During the rest of the time, the card is inactive, and transactions will be declined. Simply start the 60-minute time window during which fuel can be purchased. After the time has expired, the card is automatically deactivated again.\n\nWhat other benefits does the DKV Mobility App offer?\n\nIf you need immediate assistance, for example in the event of a breakdown or the loss of your card, the app offers direct dialing to connect you to the helpline.\n\nYou can find more information about our range of services at https://www.dkv-mobility.com/en/. \n\nDKV.

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating?

This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

      "label": "Never miss a bus or train stop again! Setting location-based alarms is easy and fun using gestures on OmniBuzz. It works efficiently in the background, and vibrates and makes noise as soon as you near your destination. Take a long nap, or do things on your phone besides stare at your maps app.\n\nTry the new Notification Center Widget or the Apple Watch app for quickly checking how close you are to your destination, or enabling a recently used alarm, without having to open the main app!\n\nMany ways to easily set your alarm:\n- Search by an address or common name to set location\n- Tap on map to set location\n- Drag-and-drop the bee pin to fine-tune location\n- Pinch the alarm circle area or drag the circle outline to resize\n- Manually set the alarm radius distance (tap top-left corner)\n- Reuse a recently used alarm\n\nCustomize your alarm sound to make sure you notice it:\n- Over 25 standard iOS alarm sounds to choose from\n- Customizable alarm duration\n- Continous vibration\n\nDon't waste your time with the other bus alarm apps! We have tried most of them and are confident that OmniBuzz is better than the rest. Unlike the others, OmniBuzz is not frustrating to figure out how to set alarms, has a larger range of customizability while maintaining a much simpler user interface, is completely free and has no ads.\n\nNote: May not work well in underground areas with limited GPS signal, such as a subway. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Whether you want a scenic, winding route or the fastest way from A to B, voice commands and the clear TFT display with arrows providing directions will guide you and your motorbike safely to your destination.

The connection is established wirelessly between a smartphone, the vehicle and – if available – a communication system via Bluetooth; the app is operated using the multi-controller on the handlebar. We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

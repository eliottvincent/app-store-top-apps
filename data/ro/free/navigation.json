      "label": "Atlas Navi is a Drive to Earn A.I. navigation app that uses live video from your smartphone camera to analyze the road in front of you and automatically detect: \n- traffic in each lane (counting how many vehicles are in each lane in front of you) \n- road construction / road work signs \n- road closures \n- accident detection \n- police vehicles (some countries only) \n- potholes \n- available / free parking space\n\nThe app uses advanced computer vision (A.I.) algorithms to analyze the video feeds from your smartphone camera and detect all the above problems on the road. It does this in the background, without interfering with the navigation instructions. \n\nAtlas Navi analyses the road 25 times per second when used with the camera from your smartphone. It generates 100 times better data than other navigation systems, which helps reroute other drivers to avoid potential traffic congestion and dangerous situations. \nBased on these A.I. detections, the app reroutes other drivers on quicker, safer, and less congested routes. \n\nAtlas Navi only uploads to the server the relevant information for traffic optimization: the type of detections and the GPS co-ordinates of said problem. No images or videos are uploaded unless specifically enabled by the user. If enabled, it can store your road trip recorded videos in the cloud, but the default option is to keep them on your device. \nAtlas Navi rewards drivers who send traffic data with a small amount of $NAVI for each mile they drive if they have a 3D vehicle selected in the app and provide traffic data from their cameras.\n\nYou can of course use Atlas Navi as a standard navigation app, without turning on the smartphone camera or the A.I. detections. You will benefit from all the rerouting and information received from other drivers which will make your route safer and faster. \n\nCurrent features include: \n- Navigation module with very accurate address search function \n- Video recording of your road trips, stored in the cloud or on the device \n- Trip history with associated videos (if any) \n- A.I. camera view - see what the camera is detecting in real time around you. \n- Livestream your road trip by sharing a simple link (the others don't need to download Atlas Navi) \n- Car garage where you can select from 3D vehicles in your garage. Customize, change their color, and choose which one you want to drive with today. \n- Rewards system - get rewarded in $NAVI if others join your Driving Club \n- Driving Club - see the others who have joined your personal club \n- Wallet - rewards earned and spent\n\nAtlas Navi is adding more features on a bi-weekly basis and will keep you updated with the latest innovation in avoiding traffic using A.I."

      "label": "In Iasi si Oradea aplicatia foloseste date reale de la regionala de transport. \nAceasta aplicatie iti permite sa vezi mijloacele de transport in comun puse pe harta de ceilalti calatori. Pentru o buna functionare trebuie facuta o promovare masiva in fiecare oras, momentan suntem in procesul de promovare in Iasi, urmand Bucuresti si apoi celelalte orase, deci la incepul este de asteptat sa vedeti putine autobuze. Asteptati promovarea in orasul dumneavoastra inainte sa aveti asteptarea sa fie multe autobuze pe harta.\n\nInstalati aplicatia pentru a vedea pe harta in timp real mijloacele de transport in comun din Iasi (si din celelalte mari orase alea tarii: Alba, Arad, Brasov, Bucuresti, Cluj, Constanta, Craiova, Iasi, Oradea, Ploiesti, Sibiu, Timisoara, in curand si Bacau).\n\nPrincipiul de functionare se baseaza pe inputul comunitatii de calatori, fiecare utilizator avand sansa de a vedea informatiile despre mijloacele de transport in comun, dar in acelasi timp este sarcina noastra a tuturor sa sharuim informatiile despre mijloacele de transport cu care calatorim. In acest mod, aplicatia nu depinde de nici un fel de hardware special (GPS-uri pe autobuze sau servere ale regiilor de transport in comun etc), folosind intr-un mod util ceea ce cu totii avem in ziua de astazi (smartphone-ul).\n\n\nPentru a folosi aplicatia NU este necesar nici un fel de autentificare, este gratuita, momentan nu are nici reclame care sa deranjeze, singura conditie pentru a folosi aplicatia este sa fim solidari unii cu ceilalti si sa \"sharuim\" informatii despre locatia autobuzelor.\n\nDin punct de vedere technic, proiectul nostru are in spate platforma Firebase pentru a putea avea functionalitatea de update in timp real a pozitiilor mijloacelor de transport in comun.\n\nInterfata aplicatiei consta intr-o harta a orasului nostru, un cerc de 1km, o componenta de cautare si un buton.\nPractic incarcam pe harta doar mijloacele de transport in comun de pe o raza de un 1km fata de locatia mea curenta, desigur daca dorim sa vedem si dincolo de aceasta distanta putem folosi componenta de \"Cautare\", toate mijloacele de transport in comun selectate prin acea componenta devin vizibile pe harta necontand distanta fata de locatia mea. Putem defini un numar limitat momentan la 2 route \"favorite\", acestea vor fi vizibile pe harta pe toata suprafata orasului la incarcarea aplicatiei.\nPentru a sharui locatia unui mijloc de transport avem 2 cazuri:\n1. Daca autobuzul/tramvaiul cu care intentionez sa plec nu a fost inca sharuit de altcineva ne harta, apas butonul verde -> \"Am plecat\", apoi din lista afisata selectez ruta dorita si directia de deplasare printr-un slide stanga sau dreapta. \n2. Daca autobuzul a fost deja sharuit, dau click pe el si apas \"Am plecat\"\n\nAplicatia face validari si nu permite sharuirea de informatii decat daca userul se afla pe traseul mijlocului de transport respectiv.\nCand sharuim locatia unui mijloc de transport cu optiunea \"Am plecat\"  aplicatia incepe sa ia recurent locatia userului curent, cu functionalitatea \"Am vazut\" dau voi aplicatiei sa-mi ia o singura data locatia. \nOdata sharuita locatia unui autobuz userul nu este nevoit neaparat sa stea cu aplicatia pornita, poate inchide ecranul telefonului sau poate comuta catre orice alta aplicatie doreste (desigur cu conditia sa tina in background aplicatia HereItIs).\n\nAplicatia Necesita urmatoarele drepturi de accces:\n- Accessul la locatia curenta (atat cand aplicatia e deschisa cat si cand e in background)\n\nO prezentare a aplicatiei puteti gasi aici: https://storage.googleapis.com/here-it-is/public/Romania/Prezentare_HEREITIS.pdf"

      "label": "CT BUS APPLICATION\n\nCT Bus application is a travel platform offered by CTBUS S.A.. In the application all the actions necessary to facilitate the use of public transport can be performed.\nThe application allows the purchase of travel tickets using the bank card or the electronic wallet, the calculation of the optimal route for the passenger and the visualization of lines, stations and means of transport in real time on the map.\nAfter creating an account and associating it with a transport card, the user can recharge the card with travel tickets directly in the application, using online payment by bank card or electronic wallet. The user can check the status of the card and the active travel tickets at any given time.\nA user can manage several transport cards on a single account and can perform actions of recharging the respective cards, whether it is the recharge of the electronic wallet, the purchase of new subscriptions or the extension of the existing ones.\nAfter performing the various purchase/validation/control actions, the user will have the possibility of viewing a detailed history of transactions.\nUsers who benefit from subsidies in accordance with the legislation in force will be able to request the approval of a subsidized profile directly from the application by sending supporting documents. Following the approval of such a profile from the application or from the ticket point, users will be able to purchase/request, directly from the application, travel tickets with discount or free of charge.\nLegal entities that have a collaboration with the transport administration will be able to manage their card portfolio directly from the web portal or the mobile application.\nWhen purchasing a travel ticket, when it is approaching its expiration date or when other actions are performed on the card, the user can choose to receive push notifications or e-mails.\nThe application provides the traveler with the means to find the optimal route between the starting point A and the arrival point B, using the locations of the vehicles on the route.\nThe traveler can start the journey from the current location or from another location on the map and can choose their destination by looking for an address, a point of interest, a desired station or even placing a pin on the map. They can also choose a location they have previously searched for or added to favorites.\nThe application shows how long it will take to get to the nearest station, when the vehicle will arrive at the station and how long the trip will take.\nIt gives the traveler the possibility of saving frequently used locations on a designated menu page or when searching for those locations on the main page. Thus, the user can start a much faster and easier route in the future.\nThe application will display in real time the vehicle that the passenger must take and will notify them when they must change the line.\nThe user can view on the map the complete route of a line or just a direction of the route and can save the favorite lines. They will receive a message when a problem occurs with one of them if that problem could affect their trip.\nOn the page dedicated to lines, they can search for the desired line and then view on the map, in real time, the vehicles on one direction of that line.\nThey can select a station on the main page or on the route of a line, and thus can see all the lines that stop at that station and what the arrival times are for each line. They can see the next three times and the schedule for all the lines in that station.\nTicket points of the transport administration can be found on the map. By selecting such a point the user can see its operating schedule.\nThe application is available in Romanian and English, depending on the language set in the device used."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices.

The application allows the purchase of travel tickets using the bank card, the calculation of the optimal route for the passenger and the visualization of lines, stations and means of transport in real time on the map.\n\nAfter creating an account and associating it with a transport card, the user can recharge the card with travel tickets directly in the application, using online payment by bank card. The user can check the status of the card and the active travel tickets at any given time.\n\nA user can manage several transport cards on a single account and can perform actions of recharging the respective cards, whether it is the recharge of the electronic wallet, the purchase of new subscriptions or the extension of the existing ones.\n\nAfter performing the various purchase/validation/control actions, the user will have the possibility of viewing a detailed history of transactions.\n\nUsers who benefit from subsidies in accordance with the legislation in force will be able to request the approval of a subsidized profile directly from the application by sending supporting documents. Following the approval of such a profile from the application or from the ticket point, users will be able to purchase/request, directly from the application, travel tickets with discount or free of charge.\n\nLegal entities that have a collaboration with the transport administration will be able to manage their card portfolio directly from the web portal or the mobile application.\n\nWhen purchasing a travel ticket, when it is approaching its expiration date or when other actions are performed on the card, the user can choose to receive push notifications or e-mails.\n\nThe application provides the traveler with the means to find the optimal route between the starting point A and the arrival point B, using the locations of the vehicles on the route.\n\nThe traveler can start the journey from the current location or from another location on the map and can choose their destination by looking for an address, a point of interest, a desired station or even placing a pin on the map. They can also choose a location they have previously searched for or added to favorites.\n\nThe application shows how long it will take to get to the nearest station, when the vehicle will arrive at the station and how long the trip will take.\n\nIt gives the traveler the possibility of saving frequently used locations on a designated menu page or when searching for those locations on the main page. Thus, the user can start a much faster and easier route in the future.\n\nThe application will display in real time the vehicle that the passenger must take and will notify them when they must change the line.\n\nThe user can view on the map the complete route of a line or just a direction of the route and can save the favorite lines. They will receive a message when a problem occurs with one of them if that problem could affect their trip.\n\nOn the page dedicated to lines, they can search for the desired line and then view on the map, in real time, the vehicles on one direction of that line.\n\nThey can select a station on the main page or on the route of a line, and thus can see all the lines that stop at that station and what the arrival times are for each line. They can see the next three times and the schedule for all the lines in that station.\n\nTicket points of the transport administration can be found on the map. By selecting such a point the user can see its operating schedule.\n\nThe application is available in Romanian and English, depending on the language set in the device used."

Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under \"Settings / Advanced settings\" in iOS 7."

In the application all the actions necessary to facilitate the use of public transport can be performed.\nThe application allows the purchase of travel tickets using the bank card, the calculation of the optimal route for the passenger and the visualization of lines, stations and means of transport in real time on the map.\nAfter creating an account and associating it with a transport card, the user can recharge the card with travel tickets directly in the application, using online payment by bank card. The user can check the status of the card and the active travel tickets at any given time.\nA user can manage several transport cards on a single account and can perform actions of recharging the respective cards, whether it is the recharge of the electronic wallet, the purchase of new subscriptions or the extension of the existing ones.\nAfter performing the various purchase/validation/control actions, the user will have the possibility of viewing a detailed history of transactions.\nUsers who benefit from subsidies in accordance with the legislation in force will be able to request the approval of a subsidized profile directly from the application by sending supporting documents. Following the approval of such a profile from the application or from the ticket point, users will be able to purchase/request, directly from the application, travel tickets with discount or free of charge.\nLegal entities that have a collaboration with the transport administration will be able to manage their card portfolio directly from the web portal or the mobile application.\nWhen purchasing a travel ticket, when it is approaching its expiration date or when other actions are performed on the card, the user can choose to receive push notifications or e-mails.\nThe application provides the traveler with the means to find the optimal route between the starting point A and the arrival point B, using the locations of the vehicles on the route.\nThe traveler can start the journey from the current location or from another location on the map and can choose their destination by looking for an address, a point of interest, a desired station or even placing a pin on the map. They can also choose a location they have previously searched for or added to favorites.\nThe application shows how long it will take to get to the nearest station, when the vehicle will arrive at the station and how long the trip will take.\nIt gives the traveler the possibility of saving frequently used locations on a designated menu page or when searching for those locations on the main page. Thus, the user can start a much faster and easier route in the future.\nThe application will display in real time the vehicle that the passenger must take and will notify them when they must change the line.\nThe user can view on the map the complete route of a line or just a direction of the route and can save the favorite lines. They will receive a message when a problem occurs with one of them if that problem could affect their trip.\nOn the page dedicated to lines, they can search for the desired line and then view on the map, in real time, the vehicles on one direction of that line.\nThey can select a station on the main page or on the route of a line, and thus can see all the lines that stop at that station and what the arrival times are for each line. They can see the next three times and the schedule for all the lines in that station.\nTicket points of the transport administration can be found on the map. By selecting such a point the user can see its operating schedule.\nThe application is available in Romanian and English, depending on the language set in the device used."

Download the app now and save on the fines today!\nYou no longer need a stationary video recorder to reduce the risk of misconduct from other drivers or the traffic police. You don't need the radar detector too. With Smart Driver, you already have all this in your smartphone or tablet.\nSmart Driver works in the background mode - you can use it with navigation apps. While you are driving, the app notifies you about road hazards by voice and visual tips, records video with sound in a background mode without stopping other apps.\n\nCurrently the app database includes road hazards for the following countries:\n- Russia\n- Germany\n- Ukraine\n- Belarus\n- Kazakhstan\n- Uzbekistan\n- Turkmenistan\n- Azerbaijan\n- Armenia\n- Georgia\n- Austria\n- Netherlands\n- Spain\n- Belgium\n- Switzerland\n- United States\n- Brazil\n- France\n- Italy\n- Finland\n- Bulgaria\n- Denmark\n- Estonia\n- Poland\n- Romania\n\nThe application available in Russian, English and German languages.\n\nFollow us on VK social network: http://vk.com/public59336195\nOfficial page on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/201419256701196?fref=ts \n\nIf you have any comments, ideas, information about missing cameras, or other, please write it here.\n\nPlease note!\nWhen you use the app in the background mode, it can reduce battery life. Don't forget to stop the app, when you don't need it.\nSmart Driver is your assistant, but it can't guarantee the absence of fines, because new cameras and hazards can not immediately be added to the database. Please follow the traffic rules.\n\nKey app features:\nAlerting about speed cameras and traffic police posts\nRunning in the background with a navigator\nSupport notifications about pair cameras that measure average speed on a road section\nVideo recording\n\nYou can use a free version with database update once a week to be notified about road hazards and to test the app. Also you can subscribe for additional features and unlimited database update monthly (2.99 Euro), annually (15.99 Euro), or buy an unlimited version (24.99 Euro). The app also may have a premium subscription with a 50% discount on a monthly (1,99 Euro), annually (9,99 Euro), or unlimited basis (12,99 Euro) and 90% discount on unlimited basis (2,29 Euro).\n\nSubscription is automatically renewed in 24 hours before expiration.

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

The app helps you navigate to your destination and as a cherry on top, you get to start a parking action upon arrival. All of this in a single app and throughout the whole of Europe. Making your life easier, safer and more efficient before, during and after your trip, Flitsmeister is your best friend! \n\nThere are several other ways in which Flitsmeister will make your life easier: \n\n• Mobile and fixed speed cam, speed check zone alerts; to save your hard-earned cash.   \n\n• Traffic jam alerts; check in advance whether you will be encountering a traffic jam on your route and start a new route if necessary. \n\n• Service vehicle alerts such as ambulances and fire trucks, to help you get out of the way calmly and in time so they can reach their destination more quickly.  \n\n• Accidents, roadworks, stationary vehicles and other incident alerts: allowing you to anticipate the situation safely and in time. \n\n• Matrix sign alerts: never miss a closed exit, opened rush hour lane or maximum speed instructions ever again. \n\n• Navigation: the right instructions to get from A to B, taking into account the current situation on the road or recommending a different route if disturbances are expected on your route.  \n\n• Paid parking: start a parking action upon arrival at your destination with the tap of a button. The app will recognise whether you are located in a parking zone to make sure you don’t forget to start the parking action. We will send you a notification as soon as you get back behind the wheel so you never forget to stop your parking action and never overpay. \n\n• Traffic lights: certain traffic lights in the Netherlands will send their current status to the app. The number of these ‘smart’ traffic lights will be increasing in the future, allowing us to show you a countdown for the green light and speed recommendations to keep you in the green wave. \n\n• Apple Carplay for Flitsmeister on the screen of your car: navigate to your destination even more conveniently by displaying Flitsmeister on the screen of your car. Of course, you will also keep receiving the usual alerts for speed cams, traffic jams and hazards during your trip. \n\n\nCOMMUNITY \nOur entire team is dedicated to making the app better and more complete every single day. We boast a robust community with over 1.7 million active users in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

      "label": "The DKV Mobility App is your practical everyday help. Whether you're looking for DKV Mobility service stations or charging points in Europe or within your neighbourhood area, or whether you want to wash or park your vehicle, or even settle your refuelling bill with your smartphone: Our app is always there to guide you to the desired result in just a few steps.\n\nPaying after refuelling directly in your car?\n\nThe APP&GO feature guides you through the entire refuelling process: from selecting the nearest APP&GO station to authorising payment - the DKV Mobility App remains available to help you save valuable time in your daily routine.\n\nCharging your electric vehicle?\n\nThe new update of the DKV Mobility App not only gives you access to over 66,000 fuel stations, but to also more than 200,000 public charging points in our network. It's easy and is just one click away. Another unique feature is the intelligent route planning, where the DKV Mobility App automatically calculates the best route with optimal charging stops for long distances.\n\nNeed to find a station quickly?\n\nWith our new home screen, you have instant access to the station closest to you. You can check the price and start navigation right away.\n\nActively managing time windows in which the DKV CARD can be used?\n\nThe activation mode \"on demand\" offers the possibility to activate cards only for the period in which they are used for a transaction. During the rest of the time, the card is inactive, and transactions will be declined. Simply start the 60-minute time window during which fuel can be purchased. After the time has expired, the card is automatically deactivated again.\n\nWhat other benefits does the DKV Mobility App offer?\n\nIf you need immediate assistance, for example in the event of a breakdown or the loss of your card, the app offers direct dialing to connect you to the helpline.\n\nYou can find more information about our range of services at https://www.dkv-mobility.com/en/. \n\nDKV. You drive, we care."

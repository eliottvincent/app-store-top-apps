It generates 100 times better data than other navigation systems, which helps reroute other drivers to avoid potential traffic congestion and dangerous situations. \nBased on these A.I. detections, the app reroutes other drivers on quicker, safer, and less congested routes. \n\nAtlas Navi only uploads to the server the relevant information for traffic optimization: the type of detections and the GPS co-ordinates of said problem. No images or videos are uploaded unless specifically enabled by the user. If enabled, it can store your road trip recorded videos in the cloud, but the default option is to keep them on your device. \nAtlas Navi rewards drivers who send traffic data with a small amount of $NAVI for each mile they drive if they have a 3D vehicle selected in the app and provide traffic data from their cameras.\n\nYou can of course use Atlas Navi as a standard navigation app, without turning on the smartphone camera or the A.I. detections. You will benefit from all the rerouting and information received from other drivers which will make your route safer and faster. \n\nCurrent features include: \n- Navigation module with very accurate address search function \n- Video recording of your road trips, stored in the cloud or on the device \n- Trip history with associated videos (if any) \n- A.I. camera view - see what the camera is detecting in real time around you. \n- Livestream your road trip by sharing a simple link (the others don't need to download Atlas Navi) \n- Car garage where you can select from 3D vehicles in your garage. Customize, change their color, and choose which one you want to drive with today. \n- Rewards system - get rewarded in $NAVI if others join your Driving Club \n- Driving Club - see the others who have joined your personal club \n- Wallet - rewards earned and spent\n\nAtlas Navi is adding more features on a bi-weekly basis and will keep you updated with the latest innovation in avoiding traffic using A.I."

In the application all the actions necessary to facilitate the use of public transport can be performed.\nThe application allows the purchase of travel tickets using the bank card or the electronic wallet, the calculation of the optimal route for the passenger and the visualization of lines, stations and means of transport in real time on the map.\nAfter creating an account and associating it with a transport card, the user can recharge the card with travel tickets directly in the application, using online payment by bank card or electronic wallet. The user can check the status of the card and the active travel tickets at any given time.\nA user can manage several transport cards on a single account and can perform actions of recharging the respective cards, whether it is the recharge of the electronic wallet, the purchase of new subscriptions or the extension of the existing ones.\nAfter performing the various purchase/validation/control actions, the user will have the possibility of viewing a detailed history of transactions.\nUsers who benefit from subsidies in accordance with the legislation in force will be able to request the approval of a subsidized profile directly from the application by sending supporting documents. Following the approval of such a profile from the application or from the ticket point, users will be able to purchase/request, directly from the application, travel tickets with discount or free of charge.\nLegal entities that have a collaboration with the transport administration will be able to manage their card portfolio directly from the web portal or the mobile application.\nWhen purchasing a travel ticket, when it is approaching its expiration date or when other actions are performed on the card, the user can choose to receive push notifications or e-mails.\nThe application provides the traveler with the means to find the optimal route between the starting point A and the arrival point B, using the locations of the vehicles on the route.\nThe traveler can start the journey from the current location or from another location on the map and can choose their destination by looking for an address, a point of interest, a desired station or even placing a pin on the map. They can also choose a location they have previously searched for or added to favorites.\nThe application shows how long it will take to get to the nearest station, when the vehicle will arrive at the station and how long the trip will take.\nIt gives the traveler the possibility of saving frequently used locations on a designated menu page or when searching for those locations on the main page. Thus, the user can start a much faster and easier route in the future.\nThe application will display in real time the vehicle that the passenger must take and will notify them when they must change the line.\nThe user can view on the map the complete route of a line or just a direction of the route and can save the favorite lines. They will receive a message when a problem occurs with one of them if that problem could affect their trip.\nOn the page dedicated to lines, they can search for the desired line and then view on the map, in real time, the vehicles on one direction of that line.\nThey can select a station on the main page or on the route of a line, and thus can see all the lines that stop at that station and what the arrival times are for each line. They can see the next three times and the schedule for all the lines in that station.\nTicket points of the transport administration can be found on the map. By selecting such a point the user can see its operating schedule.\nThe application is available in Romanian and English, depending on the language set in the device used."

      "label": "In Iasi si Oradea aplicatia foloseste date reale de la regionala de transport. \nAceasta aplicatie iti permite sa vezi mijloacele de transport in comun puse pe harta de ceilalti calatori. Pentru o buna functionare trebuie facuta o promovare masiva in fiecare oras, momentan suntem in procesul de promovare in Iasi, urmand Bucuresti si apoi celelalte orase, deci la incepul este de asteptat sa vedeti putine autobuze. Asteptati promovarea in orasul dumneavoastra inainte sa aveti asteptarea sa fie multe autobuze pe harta.\n\nInstalati aplicatia pentru a vedea pe harta in timp real mijloacele de transport in comun din Iasi (si din celelalte mari orase alea tarii: Alba, Arad, Brasov, Bucuresti, Cluj, Constanta, Craiova, Iasi, Oradea, Ploiesti, Sibiu, Timisoara, in curand si Bacau).\n\nPrincipiul de functionare se baseaza pe inputul comunitatii de calatori, fiecare utilizator avand sansa de a vedea informatiile despre mijloacele de transport in comun, dar in acelasi timp este sarcina noastra a tuturor sa sharuim informatiile despre mijloacele de transport cu care calatorim. In acest mod, aplicatia nu depinde de nici un fel de hardware special (GPS-uri pe autobuze sau servere ale regiilor de transport in comun etc), folosind intr-un mod util ceea ce cu totii avem in ziua de astazi (smartphone-ul).\n\n\nPentru a folosi aplicatia NU este necesar nici un fel de autentificare, este gratuita, momentan nu are nici reclame care sa deranjeze, singura conditie pentru a folosi aplicatia este sa fim solidari unii cu ceilalti si sa \"sharuim\" informatii despre locatia autobuzelor.\n\nDin punct de vedere technic, proiectul nostru are in spate platforma Firebase pentru a putea avea functionalitatea de update in timp real a pozitiilor mijloacelor de transport in comun.\n\nInterfata aplicatiei consta intr-o harta a orasului nostru, un cerc de 1km, o componenta de cautare si un buton.\nPractic incarcam pe harta doar mijloacele de transport in comun de pe o raza de un 1km fata de locatia mea curenta, desigur daca dorim sa vedem si dincolo de aceasta distanta putem folosi componenta de \"Cautare\", toate mijloacele de transport in comun selectate prin acea componenta devin vizibile pe harta necontand distanta fata de locatia mea. Putem defini un numar limitat momentan la 2 route \"favorite\", acestea vor fi vizibile pe harta pe toata suprafata orasului la incarcarea aplicatiei.\nPentru a sharui locatia unui mijloc de transport avem 2 cazuri:\n1. Daca autobuzul/tramvaiul cu care intentionez sa plec nu a fost inca sharuit de altcineva ne harta, apas butonul verde -> \"Am plecat\", apoi din lista afisata selectez ruta dorita si directia de deplasare printr-un slide stanga sau dreapta. \n2. Daca autobuzul a fost deja sharuit, dau click pe el si apas \"Am plecat\"\n\nAplicatia face validari si nu permite sharuirea de informatii decat daca userul se afla pe traseul mijlocului de transport respectiv.\nCand sharuim locatia unui mijloc de transport cu optiunea \"Am plecat\"  aplicatia incepe sa ia recurent locatia userului curent, cu functionalitatea \"Am vazut\" dau voi aplicatiei sa-mi ia o singura data locatia. \nOdata sharuita locatia unui autobuz userul nu este nevoit neaparat sa stea cu aplicatia pornita, poate inchide ecranul telefonului sau poate comuta catre orice alta aplicatie doreste (desigur cu conditia sa tina in background aplicatia HereItIs).\n\nAplicatia Necesita urmatoarele drepturi de accces:\n- Accessul la locatia curenta (atat cand aplicatia e deschisa cat si cand e in background)\n\nO prezentare a aplicatiei puteti gasi aici: https://storage.googleapis.com/here-it-is/public/Romania/Prezentare_HEREITIS.pdf"

In the application all the actions necessary to facilitate the use of public transport can be performed. The application allows the purchase of travel tickets using the bank card, the calculation of the optimal route for the passenger and the visualization of lines, stations and means of transport in real time on the map.\n\nAfter creating an account and associating it with a transport card, the user can recharge the card with travel tickets directly in the application, using online payment by bank card. The user can check the status of the card and the active travel tickets at any given time.\n\nA user can manage several transport cards on a single account and can perform actions of recharging the respective cards, whether it is the recharge of the electronic wallet, the purchase of new subscriptions or the extension of the existing ones.\n\nAfter performing the various purchase/validation/control actions, the user will have the possibility of viewing a detailed history of transactions.\n\nUsers who benefit from subsidies in accordance with the legislation in force will be able to request the approval of a subsidized profile directly from the application by sending supporting documents. Following the approval of such a profile from the application or from the ticket point, users will be able to purchase/request, directly from the application, travel tickets with discount or free of charge.\n\nLegal entities that have a collaboration with the transport administration will be able to manage their card portfolio directly from the web portal or the mobile application.\n\nWhen purchasing a travel ticket, when it is approaching its expiration date or when other actions are performed on the card, the user can choose to receive push notifications or e-mails.\n\nThe application provides the traveler with the means to find the optimal route between the starting point A and the arrival point B, using the locations of the vehicles on the route.\n\nThe traveler can start the journey from the current location or from another location on the map and can choose their destination by looking for an address, a point of interest, a desired station or even placing a pin on the map. They can also choose a location they have previously searched for or added to favorites.\n\nThe application shows how long it will take to get to the nearest station, when the vehicle will arrive at the station and how long the trip will take.\n\nIt gives the traveler the possibility of saving frequently used locations on a designated menu page or when searching for those locations on the main page. Thus, the user can start a much faster and easier route in the future.\n\nThe application will display in real time the vehicle that the passenger must take and will notify them when they must change the line.\n\nThe user can view on the map the complete route of a line or just a direction of the route and can save the favorite lines. They will receive a message when a problem occurs with one of them if that problem could affect their trip.\n\nOn the page dedicated to lines, they can search for the desired line and then view on the map, in real time, the vehicles on one direction of that line.\n\nThey can select a station on the main page or on the route of a line, and thus can see all the lines that stop at that station and what the arrival times are for each line. They can see the next three times and the schedule for all the lines in that station.\n\nTicket points of the transport administration can be found on the map. By selecting such a point the user can see its operating schedule.\n\nThe application is available in Romanian and English, depending on the language set in the device used."

Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under \"Settings / Advanced settings\" in iOS 7."

In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service.

Whether you're looking for DKV Mobility service stations or charging points in Europe or within your neighbourhood area, or whether you want to wash or park your vehicle, or even settle your refuelling bill with your smartphone: Our app is always there to guide you to the desired result in just a few steps.\n\nPaying after refuelling directly in your car?\n\nThe APP&GO feature guides you through the entire refuelling process: from selecting the nearest APP&GO station to authorising payment - the DKV Mobility App remains available to help you save valuable time in your daily routine.\n\nCharging your electric vehicle?\n\nThe new update of the DKV Mobility App not only gives you access to over 66,000 fuel stations, but to also more than 200,000 public charging points in our network. It's easy and is just one click away. Another unique feature is the intelligent route planning, where the DKV Mobility App automatically calculates the best route with optimal charging stops for long distances.\n\nNeed to find a station quickly?\n\nWith our new home screen, you have instant access to the station closest to you. You can check the price and start navigation right away.\n\nActively managing time windows in which the DKV CARD can be used?\n\nThe activation mode \"on demand\" offers the possibility to activate cards only for the period in which they are used for a transaction. During the rest of the time, the card is inactive, and transactions will be declined. Simply start the 60-minute time window during which fuel can be purchased. After the time has expired, the card is automatically deactivated again.\n\nWhat other benefits does the DKV Mobility App offer?\n\nIf you need immediate assistance, for example in the event of a breakdown or the loss of your card, the app offers direct dialing to connect you to the helpline.\n\nYou can find more information about our range of services at https://www.dkv-mobility.com/en/. \n\nDKV.

In-App purchase can be used to remove the bottom advertisement and to support us.\n\nThis application does not need an internet connection and works best in outdoors.\n\nBy default, it uses device sensor to determine the elevation from see level, but you also have the option to use NOAA data files to get the altitude of your location. On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

In addition, then the GPS reception is active in the background. This can quickly drain the battery. Using the app abroad may incur additional roaming charges if your roaming feature is enabled.

      "label": "Speed Limit App displays the current speed limit and your current speed. It detects European speed limit signs using the camera while driving and enhances the results by map based limits from OpenStreetMap. Thus it will even know limits which are not indicated by signs (i.e. Zone 30, or inner city areas). Of course it will warn you when you are too fast. \n\n► Working principle of Speed Limit App\nSpeed Limit App is a road sign recognition app. For inner city limits we use map based information from OpenStreetMap. Both information is merged to provide an optimal limit indication. The speedometer gets its data from the GPS and is used to determine wether you are above or below the actual limit of the last detected road sign.\n\n► Limitations of Speed Limit App\nSpeedometer Radar Camera does a computational intensive job that formerly was limited to mainframes. Therefore there are some restrictions:\n\n- At night and in adverse lighting conditions the recognition of road signs might fail due to iPhone camera limitations.\n- The app is optimized for European road signs. Unfortunately there is yet no support for US speed limits.\n- There is no support for 'end of limit' signs yet and no support for place/city signs that might also decrease the speed limit according to local traffic road regulations.\n- Sometimes road signs in narrow turns are missed due to the limited view angle of the camera\n- Sometimes there are missed or false road sign detections\n- Speedometer is updated every second\n\n► Notes from the developer\nIf you like Speed Limit warning Camera please rate the app. If you don't like it please send your suggestions by email to the developer team. If you want to get it ad-free please get the IAP and bear in mind that developing such a complicated app requires knowledge and time which should be rewarded. Please refrain from complaining about the pricing policy.\n\n► Disclaimer for Speedometer Radar Camera\nThe author of this app takes no liability whatsoever for any damages that may occur in connection with this app. In particular, all claims against the author are excluded. By using the app, the user recognizes this complete exclusion of liability and damage compensation. The use of the app is entirely at the risk of the user.\n\n► Important Notes Concerning Subscriptions\nAll above subscriptions renew within 24 hours before the current period ends, and you will be charged through your iTunes account. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription. Manage or cancel your subscription from iTunes Account settings.

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit.

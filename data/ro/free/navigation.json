Pentru o buna functionare trebuie facuta o promovare masiva in fiecare oras, momentan suntem in procesul de promovare in Iasi, urmand Bucuresti si apoi celelalte orase, deci la incepul este de asteptat sa vedeti putine autobuze. Asteptati promovarea in orasul dumneavoastra inainte sa aveti asteptarea sa fie multe autobuze pe harta.\n\nInstalati aplicatia pentru a vedea pe harta in timp real mijloacele de transport in comun din Iasi (si din celelalte mari orase alea tarii: Alba, Arad, Brasov, Bucuresti, Cluj, Constanta, Craiova, Iasi, Oradea, Ploiesti, Sibiu, Timisoara, in curand si Bacau).\n\nPrincipiul de functionare se baseaza pe inputul comunitatii de calatori, fiecare utilizator avand sansa de a vedea informatiile despre mijloacele de transport in comun, dar in acelasi timp este sarcina noastra a tuturor sa sharuim informatiile despre mijloacele de transport cu care calatorim. In acest mod, aplicatia nu depinde de nici un fel de hardware special (GPS-uri pe autobuze sau servere ale regiilor de transport in comun etc), folosind intr-un mod util ceea ce cu totii avem in ziua de astazi (smartphone-ul).\n\n\nPentru a folosi aplicatia NU este necesar nici un fel de autentificare, este gratuita, momentan nu are nici reclame care sa deranjeze, singura conditie pentru a folosi aplicatia este sa fim solidari unii cu ceilalti si sa \"sharuim\" informatii despre locatia autobuzelor.\n\nDin punct de vedere technic, proiectul nostru are in spate platforma Firebase pentru a putea avea functionalitatea de update in timp real a pozitiilor mijloacelor de transport in comun.\n\nInterfata aplicatiei consta intr-o harta a orasului nostru, un cerc de 1km, o componenta de cautare si un buton.\nPractic incarcam pe harta doar mijloacele de transport in comun de pe o raza de un 1km fata de locatia mea curenta, desigur daca dorim sa vedem si dincolo de aceasta distanta putem folosi componenta de \"Cautare\", toate mijloacele de transport in comun selectate prin acea componenta devin vizibile pe harta necontand distanta fata de locatia mea. Putem defini un numar limitat momentan la 2 route \"favorite\", acestea vor fi vizibile pe harta pe toata suprafata orasului la incarcarea aplicatiei.\nPentru a sharui locatia unui mijloc de transport avem 2 cazuri:\n1. Daca autobuzul/tramvaiul cu care intentionez sa plec nu a fost inca sharuit de altcineva ne harta, apas butonul verde -> \"Am plecat\", apoi din lista afisata selectez ruta dorita si directia de deplasare printr-un slide stanga sau dreapta. \n2. Daca autobuzul a fost deja sharuit, dau click pe el si apas \"Am plecat\"\n\nAplicatia face validari si nu permite sharuirea de informatii decat daca userul se afla pe traseul mijlocului de transport respectiv.\nCand sharuim locatia unui mijloc de transport cu optiunea \"Am plecat\"  aplicatia incepe sa ia recurent locatia userului curent, cu functionalitatea \"Am vazut\" dau voi aplicatiei sa-mi ia o singura data locatia. \nOdata sharuita locatia unui autobuz userul nu este nevoit neaparat sa stea cu aplicatia pornita, poate inchide ecranul telefonului sau poate comuta catre orice alta aplicatie doreste (desigur cu conditia sa tina in background aplicatia HereItIs).\n\nAplicatia Necesita urmatoarele drepturi de accces:\n- Accessul la locatia curenta (atat cand aplicatia e deschisa cat si cand e in background)\n\nO prezentare a aplicatiei puteti gasi aici: https://storage.googleapis.com/here-it-is/public/Romania/Prezentare_HEREITIS.pdf"

They can see the next three times and the schedule for all the lines in that station.\nTicket points of the transport administration can be found on the map. By selecting such a point the user can see its operating schedule.\nThe application is available in Romanian and English, depending on the language set in the device used."

      "label": "Atlas Navi is a Drive to Earn A.I. navigation app that uses live video from your smartphone camera to analyze the road in front of you and automatically detect: \n- traffic in each lane (counting how many vehicles are in each lane in front of you) \n- road construction / road work signs \n- road closures \n- accident detection \n- police vehicles (some countries only) \n- potholes \n- available / free parking space\n\nThe app uses advanced computer vision (A.I.) algorithms to analyze the video feeds from your smartphone camera and detect all the above problems on the road. It does this in the background, without interfering with the navigation instructions. \n\nAtlas Navi analyses the road 25 times per second when used with the camera from your smartphone. It generates 100 times better data than other navigation systems, which helps reroute other drivers to avoid potential traffic congestion and dangerous situations. \nBased on these A.I. detections, the app reroutes other drivers on quicker, safer, and less congested routes. \n\nAtlas Navi only uploads to the server the relevant information for traffic optimization: the type of detections and the GPS co-ordinates of said problem. No images or videos are uploaded unless specifically enabled by the user. If enabled, it can store your road trip recorded videos in the cloud, but the default option is to keep them on your device. \nAtlas Navi rewards drivers who send traffic data with a small amount of $NAVI for each mile they drive if they have a 3D vehicle selected in the app and provide traffic data from their cameras.\n\nYou can of course use Atlas Navi as a standard navigation app, without turning on the smartphone camera or the A.I. detections. You will benefit from all the rerouting and information received from other drivers which will make your route safer and faster. \n\nCurrent features include: \n- Navigation module with very accurate address search function \n- Video recording of your road trips, stored in the cloud or on the device \n- Trip history with associated videos (if any) \n- A.I. camera view - see what the camera is detecting in real time around you. \n- Livestream your road trip by sharing a simple link (the others don't need to download Atlas Navi) \n- Car garage where you can select from 3D vehicles in your garage. Customize, change their color, and choose which one you want to drive with today. \n- Rewards system - get rewarded in $NAVI if others join your Driving Club \n- Driving Club - see the others who have joined your personal club \n- Wallet - rewards earned and spent\n\nAtlas Navi is adding more features on a bi-weekly basis and will keep you updated with the latest innovation in avoiding traffic using A.I."

The user can check the status of the card and the active travel tickets at any given time.\n\nA user can manage several transport cards on a single account and can perform actions of recharging the respective cards, whether it is the recharge of the electronic wallet, the purchase of new subscriptions or the extension of the existing ones.\n\nAfter performing the various purchase/validation/control actions, the user will have the possibility of viewing a detailed history of transactions.\n\nUsers who benefit from subsidies in accordance with the legislation in force will be able to request the approval of a subsidized profile directly from the application by sending supporting documents. Following the approval of such a profile from the application or from the ticket point, users will be able to purchase/request, directly from the application, travel tickets with discount or free of charge.\n\nLegal entities that have a collaboration with the transport administration will be able to manage their card portfolio directly from the web portal or the mobile application.\n\nWhen purchasing a travel ticket, when it is approaching its expiration date or when other actions are performed on the card, the user can choose to receive push notifications or e-mails.\n\nThe application provides the traveler with the means to find the optimal route between the starting point A and the arrival point B, using the locations of the vehicles on the route.\n\nThe traveler can start the journey from the current location or from another location on the map and can choose their destination by looking for an address, a point of interest, a desired station or even placing a pin on the map. They can also choose a location they have previously searched for or added to favorites.\n\nThe application shows how long it will take to get to the nearest station, when the vehicle will arrive at the station and how long the trip will take.\n\nIt gives the traveler the possibility of saving frequently used locations on a designated menu page or when searching for those locations on the main page. Thus, the user can start a much faster and easier route in the future.\n\nThe application will display in real time the vehicle that the passenger must take and will notify them when they must change the line.\n\nThe user can view on the map the complete route of a line or just a direction of the route and can save the favorite lines. They will receive a message when a problem occurs with one of them if that problem could affect their trip.\n\nOn the page dedicated to lines, they can search for the desired line and then view on the map, in real time, the vehicles on one direction of that line.\n\nThey can select a station on the main page or on the route of a line, and thus can see all the lines that stop at that station and what the arrival times are for each line. They can see the next three times and the schedule for all the lines in that station.\n\nTicket points of the transport administration can be found on the map. By selecting such a point the user can see its operating schedule.\n\nThe application is available in Romanian and English, depending on the language set in the device used."

If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under \"Settings / Advanced settings\" in iOS 7."

We will send you a notification as soon as you get back behind the wheel so you never forget to stop your parking action and never overpay. \n\n• Traffic lights: certain traffic lights in the Netherlands will send their current status to the app. The number of these ‘smart’ traffic lights will be increasing in the future, allowing us to show you a countdown for the green light and speed recommendations to keep you in the green wave. \n\n• Apple Carplay for Flitsmeister on the screen of your car: navigate to your destination even more conveniently by displaying Flitsmeister on the screen of your car. Of course, you will also keep receiving the usual alerts for speed cams, traffic jams and hazards during your trip. \n\n\nCOMMUNITY \nOur entire team is dedicated to making the app better and more complete every single day.

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating?

OFFLINE, with just one tap.\n\nONLY IN HIKEPACK, ALL OFFLINE:\n• One download: Trails, peaks and attractions with topo and satellite imagery covering the ENTIRE map.*\n• Planning along trails: Plan your own custom route along existing map trails by simply dropping pins on the map.\n• GPS Navigation: Time, distance, elevation profiles, total ascent, descent, and calories.\n• Get Me There: While hiking, see the remaining time, distance and route to any map symbol or to any dropped pin.\n\nPLAN YOUR TRIP\n• See elevation profiles and other advanced trail stats (length, hiking time, ascent/descent, calories)\n• Plan your own route, and see the same advanced trail stats also for it\n• See the altitude of any point on any route\n\nWHILE YOU HIKE\n• See the remaining time and distance to any location, and find the shortest route to it\n• See your location on the map\n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n• Hikepack intelligently extracts all hiking, biking and cross-country ski trails and points of interest from OpenStreetMap data, and packs them into one download. So you have a curated map focused on outdoor activities.\n\n• The topographic and satellite map layers are created by Hikepack, from open data.* They cover the ENTIRE map, which means you're never lost. This is made possible by our proprietary compression algorithms, that allow for a small download and a smooth experience.\n\n• All the routing is done on your device. So if you're in the middle of a hike and without cellular signal, you still see the remaining hiking time and distance to your destination.\n\n• You can save the routes you planned in one map, and then compare their elevation profiles at a glance.\n\n• You can change the hiking speed used for computing hiking time estimates.\n\n• You can filter what points of interest you see on the map.\n\n• You can measure distances in a straight line, between any points, but they will not take the terrain into account.\n\n••• You can download as many maps as you wish for free offline use, but some features require a Pro Pass subscription.\n\nWe're just getting started, and we'd love to hear from you! Suggest new maps or features by sending an e-mail to hello@hikepack.earth, or using the Feedback form in the app.\n\nWe regularly publish new maps in Hikepack. Currently, we cover all US national parks: Grand Canyon, Great Smoky, Yosemite, Zion, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone, Olympic, Acadia, Grand Teton, Glacier, Joshua Tree, Cuyahoga Valley, Bryce Canyon, Hawai'i Volcanoes, Arches, Hot Springs, Shenandoah, Mount Rainier, Death Valley, Haleakala, Sequoia, Capitol Reef, Badlands, Everglades, Saguaro East, Saguaro West, Canyonlands, Crater Lake, Theodore Roosevelt, Petrified Forest, Wind Cave, Kings Canyon, Mammoth Cave, Mesa Verde, Redwood, Lassen Volcanic, Glacier Bay, Carlsbad Caverns, Virgin Islands, Great Sand Dunes, Big Bend, Channel Islands, Kenai Fjords, Voyageurs, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Pinnacles, Guadalupe Mountains, Great Basin, Congaree, Katmai, North Cascades. \n\nWe also cover 40 US national forests, and many other parks, all UK national parks, 35 maps in Finland covering the main hiking areas, from the northern-most parts of Lapland, to popular parks near Helsinki, and 37 maps in Romania covering most of the Carpathian mountains.\n\n----------\n* Satellite imagery available only for selected maps in the US and Finland only. The topo layer available for all maps.\n** The maps are created by Hikepack from open data. See the details page of each map for the copyright holders."

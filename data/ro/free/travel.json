Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

Thus, Parkl saves us from all the inconvenience comes with parking tickets, payment machines and using cash. At places, where Instant parking function is available, we don’t even have to touch our phones, as the barrier opens automatically by license plate recognition. \n\nYou can also manage on-street parking easily and cashless, without hunting for parking zone codes or pre-locked credits. Extra features like automatic renewal or reminder make the process of on-street parking even more enjoyable. \n\nEV charging points can be also found on the application’s map, that helps electric vehicle owners find the nearest charging point to their destination and manage the whole charging process easily.\n\nPayment is made automatically after each transaction with the pre-registered bank card, so you don't have to bother with change or queueing at the payment machine. You can also request a VAT invoice of your parking or charging transactions that we provide you via email.\n\nOff-street parking:\n•\tFind the nearest parking space near your destination on the map.\n•\tOpen gates or barriers through the app. At places that offer the „instant parking” function, the gate opens automatically, that makes the whole process contactless.\n•\tAt most of our locations, pricing is minute. The card will be automatically charged with the amount of the parking fee. \n•\tPhotos help you identify your parking destination.\n•\tRate parking places.\n•\tYou can buy daily, weekly or monthly pass at most places.\n\nOn-street parking:\n•\tThe application automatically shows the zone you are parking in based on your position, but you can also set the zone code manually. \n•\tFees are charged by the minute to your selected bank card at the end of your parking session. You can also claim electronic invoice of your parking. There is no top-up required and there will not be any blocked amounts on your credit card!\n•\tThe expired parking session can be automatically renewed. \n•\tYou can set a reminder in the app, so you don’t forget to stop your parking.\n•\tThe street parking function can be used in every public parking area in Hungary.\n\nElectric vehicle charging: \n•\tFind the nearest Parkl electric charging point on the application’s map.\n•\tIn the app you can find a detailed description of the EV chargers’ type, fee and capacity. \n•\tPayment is automatically charged to your bank card.\n•\tThe application automatically sends a push notification when the car reaches the maximum charge level.\n\nParkl Business:\nParkl’s latest solution offers companies a transparent interface to manage employee parking.

      "label": "Just buy one of our eSIM travel mobile data packs at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) for over 190+ countries and regions globally to enjoy global connectivity. Add a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and never worry about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM-compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM for whatever local carriers exist in the country you’re currently in, but without this old-school plastic SIM card you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIM is a true technological revolution and we bring it right into your eSIM compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or pay for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your own phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store for your convenience. Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find an updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link: https://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to get connected during their travels - it doesn't matter whether you're a seafarer, flight crew, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries -  We are here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more enormous roaming data fees\n* Installation in 2 minutes or less\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your number as you travel\n* No more fumbling to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky Wi-Fi dongle around\n\nHow does it work?\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM You can install your eSIM directly or by scanning a QR code or manually inserting an activation code provided. You can also manage and top-up your eSIMs with your Airalo account.\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fragile, tiny hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things easier for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees. \n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

      "label": "Thousands of cars at your fingertips. With SHARE NOW, you'll always have a car in your city. Just like with car2go and DriveNow, our premium cars free-float around major city centres, making it easy for you to hop into the first one that catches your eye. Car-sharing is a new way of car rental, with no rental offices, no paperwork and no waiting around. Parking and fuelling/charging are free. All the perks of owning your own car – no strings attached. Rent a car the easy way. That's the SHARE NOW car-sharing app.\n\nWith SHARE NOW car-sharing, there are no annual or monthly fees for members. You can do everything you need to rent a car digitally via this smartphone app, including registration, unlocking and locking cars, payment and even the validation of your driver’s licence. That’s why we believe car-sharing is the future of urban mobility.\n\nSHARE NOW car-sharing is perfect for...\n\n• SPONTANEOUS TRIPS\nThis is car-sharing as you know it best: super short spontaneous trips for shopping, commuting and getting from A to B in your city. Find, reserve, and unlock SHARE NOW cars in less than two seconds. When you're done, simply park the car anywhere in the Home Area of your city. It’s as simple as that.\n\n• WEEKEND ROAD TRIPS\nGot plans? You can rent our free-floating cars at hourly rates. We also do medium-length road trips from just a single day to a whole weekend - get out into nature or visit your favourite shopping outlet. You’re in charge.\n\n• WEEK-LONG CAR RENTAL\nCar-sharing is also ideal for longer trips of up to 30 days for holiday travel. You can keep a car for yourself for longer (you pay per km) and take the stress of out renting a car. Roam freely outside of the Home Area and adventure beyond the city limits. We also offer pre-booking for longer trips. Tell us when and where you want your car – and we'll take care of the rest.\n\n• AIRPORT ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE\nWhether you’re catching a flight or have just landed, our cars are available at several major airports in Europe's top destinations, with dedicated parking at many locations. Car-sharing is cheaper than taxis and you never have to wait in line - just open the SHARE NOW app and reserve a car in a few taps. That’s one less thing to worry about.\n\n• BUSINESS TRIPS\nCar-sharing offers you a comfortable and cost-effective way to travel for business – with premium cars and convenient corporate invoicing. Manage all your colleagues' travel expenses in one easy admin dashboard. This is corporate car rental like never before.\n\n• CORPORATE PERKS\nCar-sharing is an affordable corporate mobility perk for your company. Offer your teams access to car-sharing and provide a comfortable way for your employees to travel for business. SHARE NOW Mobility Allowance lets you award car-sharing credit to individual employees via a single corporate account.\n\n• EARN REWARDS\nEarn points just by driving with SHARE NOW Rewards. As you level up, you’ll unlock perks and partner deals such as Bonus Reservation Time and Hourly Rates, VIP Customer Support, a Birthday Voucher and Overnight Reservation. We’ve partnered with like-minded companies to bring you special offers from those who care as much as we do about sharing. SHARE NOW Rewards is completely free to join.\n\n• INVITE FRIENDS\nInvite friends by sending them a personal code via messenger apps, such as WhatsApp, or via email or SMS. If they sign up using your promo code, you'll each earn free driving credits - it’s a win-win!\n\n\nEnjoy the largest electric car-sharing fleet in Europe with SHARE NOW. Our mission: to grow our electric fleet every year. Join the mobility movement now.\n\n\nDISCOVER CAR-SHARING IN YOUR CITY NOW:\nSHARE NOW is available in 16 major cities in 8 countries in Europe including Amsterdam, Berlin, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart,  Madrid, Milan, Rome, Turin, Paris, Vienna, Budapest and Copenhagen."

      "label": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\n\nTaxify your life with the Yango taxi app. It puts the whole city in your hands and lets you ride wherever you want to go via taxi. Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango. These scooters are bright yellow (not lime green), so you can't miss them! Easily order a scooter, find locations on the map (they look like a dot), and build routes with the same high-quality scooters you know and love, all in one convenient, top-tier app. We offer free unlocks and 20 NIS discounts on the first 3 rides to everyone who loves the feel of the wind in their hair. Just log into Yango, select scooters, and enjoy your three free unlocks!\n\nMeet Delivery in Israel - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier all around the Gush Dan district. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car.\n\nEnjoy your ride!\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the Yango taxi app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at yango.com/en_gh/support/\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties. \nUp to 50% (max 6 GHC/5 GHC) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Accra/Kumasi until 31.12.2022.\nThe 30% (max 10 EUR) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Helsinki until 31.12.2022. The 30% (max 100 kr) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Oslo until 31.12.2022.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions"

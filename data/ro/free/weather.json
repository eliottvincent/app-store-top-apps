      "label": "Simple and beautiful rustic style Thermometer now in your iPhone or iPad.\n\nWhat people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:\n\n- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

If you do not want to allow the geolocation, it is also possible to enter manually the coordinates of where you want to know the outside temperature. Useful to prepare for a trip!\n\nThe thermometer does not use any thermal sensor. It is precise and reliable as we get our data from the best weather site: openweathermap.com.\n\nThe application is customizable : change the colors and the units, switching from blue to red, and from Celsius to Farenheit degrees. Just go to the settings page and change all these parameters directly and simply.Our thermometer is realistic: you will see the gauge rise as the temperature increases, and you will be able to read the graduations easily.\n\nThe application adapts to all types of phones and tablets. It is translated into your language, for even more comfort.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback and we are listening to all your comments and advice to offer you the best application.\n\nShare, rate and comment!\n\nApple's standard terms of use apply to all subscriptions available in the application.

You can select locations and make your own ground - station list. The Sun illuminates the globe as it updates in near real-time. The short term forecasts are up to +6 hours, while the long term forecasts are up to 3 days ahead in time. They are updated when the app is active and connected to internet.\n\nAn Aurora Compass is included that shows where the auroral oval [1,2], the Moon and the Sun are located as you look up at the sky from your location. The phase and age of the Moon is also visualized in the compass. By zooming out in the 3D view port, satellites, stars and planets appear in their orbits [3] around the Sun.\n\nFEATURES\n- 3D view port of Earth.\n- Solar illumination of the Earth and the Moon.\n- Aurora oval size and location in real time.\n- Day side location of the red Cusp. \n- Forecasts based on predicted Kp index estimated by the Space Weather Prediction Centre (NOAA-SWPC).\n- Includes a 2.4 million star map [4]. \n- City light texture [5].\n- Earth, Sun and Moon textures [6,7].\n- Sky view module to track planets and stars [8].\n- 3-day space weather condition forecast as news ticker.\n- Two-Line Element (TLE) satellite orbit calculations [9].\n- Skyview navigation.\n- 3D Laser Star pointer to identify star signs.\n- Sounding rocket trajectories.\n- Sun and Moon daily elevation plots with rise and set time.\n- Epoch selection for magnetic pole position [10]\n- Ovals based on polar orbiting satellites data [11]\n- Target web links added to satellites, stars, planets and position.\n- All-sky camera links to the Boreal Aurora Camera Constellation (BACC).\n- Sky color animation [12,13].\n- Zhang and Paxton ovals [14].\n- Youtube demonstration.\n\nReferences\n[1] Sigernes F., M.

The data refreshes automatically once a connection is available.\n\nHourly forecast is updated every hour, nowcast and rain alerts update every 15 minutes. If rain or snow is expected during the next 3 hours, you will get a notice on a widget (iPhone, iPad & Mac), a large complication (Watch), and a detailed 3-hour precipitation chart in the app.\nNowcast and alerts are powered by Foreca and depend on the precision of rain radars in your area.\n\nYou can unlock professional Apple Weather, Foreca, Open-Meteo, and Dark Sky forecast sources, weather alerts, nowcast, and all styles and options via a reasonably priced subscription, which covers the cost of data and allows me to further improve Weathergraph. One-time Weathergraph Forever unlock is also available.\nThank you for your support!\n\nIf you liked Weather Line, Weathertron, or Weather Strip, you might like Weathergraph too :).\n\nPrivacy policy and Terms of use:\nhttps://weathergraph.app/privacy\n\nPlease note:\nSubscriptions made on Apple devices will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account. Your subscription will automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to cancel once activated.

Meteo confronts ambiguous weather predictions and the geographical diversity of microclimates, by allowing users to access weather data from exact locations.\n\n2.

Once a location is flagged, it’s fluidly added to a favorites list, which displays, concisely, the weather at relevant locations.\n\n3. 5-Day Forecast\nAccurate, long-range weather prediction is invaluable. Meteo, therefore, automatically generates an interactive, updated 5-day weather overview.\n\n4.

It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "• View METARs and TAFs for thousands of airports around the world\n• Tells you if your airports are above, at, or below your custom minimums for takeoff, landing, and alternate\n• Create custom alerts to be notified as soon as the weather changes (utilizes push notifications)\n• Customize visibility, wind speed, altimeter setting, and temperature units\n• Option to display information as either translated or raw\n• Map view with flight category, ceiling, and visibility\n\nView your own personalized list of airports or weather stations and quickly determine if they are above or below your takeoff, landing, or alternate minimums. No more digging through TAFs to see if your favourite alternate will hold - if it's green, it's good for the duration of the TAF! If it's yellow, it's at minimums. If it's red, the weather goes below your minimums at some point during the forecast.\n\nMinimums can be completely customized based on ceiling and visibility and is useful for all pilots, from airline to student. Simply set your personal, company, or legal limits for all of your airports, and quickly see which ones will work. You also have complete control over how TEMPO and PROB conditions should affect this analysis. Please note that minimums must be set manually by each user -  a database of IFR minimums is not included in the app. However, with Data Sharing enabled, the app can suggest commonly used minimums for each airport.\n\nSet up alerts that will notify you when the weather meets your own custom criteria. For example, you might ask Minimums to alert you when the visibility at a certain airport goes above 1 mile. Or maybe the ceiling at your destination is 300 feet and the minimums are 500 feet. Just create an alert to tell you when the ceiling goes above your desired value. Minimums uses push notifications so you don't have to constantly refresh the app. As soon as we detect your criteria has been met, we'll send your phone a notification letting you know. Alerts are currently available for ceiling, visibility, flight category (VFR, MVFR, IFR, LIFR), lowest cloud layer, and new metar issued.\n\nUnits can be customized as follows:\n- Visibility (miles or meters)\n- Wind Speed (knots or meters per second)\n- Pressure (inches of mercury or hectopascals)\n- Temperature (celsius or fahrenheit)\n- Time (UTC or Local)\n- Metars/TAFs can also be displayed as translated (decoded) or raw\n\nSunrise, sunset, and night times are also included with night defined as the center of the sun's disc being 6º below the horizon.\n\nLight and dark mode available - follows your system settings. \n\nWeather data is provided by the National Weather Service and airport names and cities are provided by Our Airports.\n\nFree version limitations:\n• Maximum 5 airports in your station list\n• No suggested minimums, but you can see which airports have suggestions available\n• No push notifications for alerts\n\nDISCLAIMER: Never use Minimums as your sole source of aviation weather information. Always consult official meteorological sources for your country. While we strive to make Minimums completely error-free, sometimes the wrong information can be displayed. Gauld Developments takes no responsibility for any damages incurred as a result of the use of this app."

Zobrazí nejen aktuální srážky nad Českem, ale i jejich předpověď na následující hodinu. Nechybí ani údaje o aktuálních teplotách, větru, srážkách nebo stavu počasí. Meteoradar umožňuje sledovat vývoj počasí téměř v reálném čase. Data jsou aktualizována každých 10 minut.\n\n* Srážky a jejich předpověď (radar)\nAplikace na mapě zobrazí aktuální srážky nad Českem a Německem s přesností až 1 km. Nechybí ani předpověď jejich vývoje na následující hodinu (dostupné u českého radaru). Přesně tak poznáte, kdy přeháňka dorazí přímo do vašeho města. Radarové snímky Česka poskytuje ČHMÚ a snímky Německa poskytuje DWD.\n\n* Údaje z meteostanic\nNa mapě jsou dostupné údaje z více než 150 meteorologických stanic. Meteorologické stanice zaznamenávají teplotu, vítr, srážky ale i vlhkost nebo tlak vzduchu. U každé stanice je v grafu uveden vývoj teploty.\n\n* Blesky\nV případě bouřek aplikace zobrazí i místa, kde uhodil blesk. Na základě radarového snímku potom poznáte, jak se bude bouřka nadále vyvíjet.\n\n* Meteozprávy\nAplikace zobrazuje informace o počasí přímo od uživatelů, kteří sledují počasí v daných místech.\n\n* Přidávejte informace o počasí\nAplikace umožňuje zasílat informace o počasí ve vaší lokalitě. Pokud se u vás vyskytuje například silná bouřka, stačí v aplikaci vytvořit hlášení o počasí, které si následně přečtou stovky lidí. Přidat můžete aktuální fotografii či popis počasí. Ostatní lidi tak varujete před nepříznivým počasím, které panuje ve vašem městě a pravděpodobně zasáhne i další.  \n\n* Widget\nDíky přehlednému widgetu získáte rychlý přehled o aktuálních srážkách na našem území.\n\nPoskytovatelem radarových snímků a detekce blesků z Česka je Český hydrometeorologický ústav. Poskytovatelem radarových snímků Německa je DWD. Databázi kamer poskytl sever Webcams.cz."

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

      "label": "Meteobot is a weather station app, specialized for precision farming. It gives you real-time information about the weather and soil conditions in your fields – directly from your Meteobot weather station. \n\nCURRENT WEATHER AND SOIL DATA\n\nWith Meteobot you get the following data, updated as often as 10 minutes:\n- Rain – amount (l/m2) and intensity (l/h)\n- Soil temperature\n- Soil moisture – at up to 3 different depths\n- Аir temperature\n- Air humidity\n- Air pressure\n- Wind speed\n- Wind direction\n- Leaf wetness\n\nHISTORICAL DATA\n\nAll data is stored securely in the Meteobot cloud for an unlimited period of time. Thus, there are no gaps or omissions – as compared to manual records keeping on paper.\n\nLOCAL WEATHER FORECAST\n\nMeteobot provides you with a local weather forecast for the specific area you are interested in. The weather forecast is for 10 days ahead. For the first two days, data is provided on an hourly basis, and from day 3 to day 10 – in 6 hours’ periods. The forecast is global. Its spatial accuracy is 8 km. The forecast is generated by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, whose weather model was named one of the most precise in the world.\n\nAGRONOMIC INDICATORS\n\nBased on data from weather stations, the Meteobot app calculates the following essential agronomic indicators:\n- Rain sum\n- Precipitation on weekly and monthly basis\n- Temperature sum\n- Average daily temperature\n- Leaf wetness duration (hours)\n\nAGROMETEOROLOGICAL HISTORY\n\nBecause Meteobot is specialized for farming, it keeps weather stations data in your fields’ history. The only thing you need to do is to outline the boundaries of your fields on the map. Once you have done it, you get a complete agro-meteorological history from the moment a weather station was installed nearby. The main advantage of Meteobot is that you receive data from your own weather station (or from another one nearby), and not from a weather device miles away from your land.\n\nMETEOROLOGICAL ALERTS\n\nUsing data from weather stations, Meteobot® App calculates and sends alerts for the following agro-meteorological indicators:\n- Average daily temperature above 10⁰С\n- Average soil temperature above 10⁰С\n- Intensive precipitation (more than 1 liter / min.)\n- First autumn chill\n- Spring chill"

      "label": "This app uses the barometric pressure sensor built into all the newer iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch Models sold after 2016 with few exceptions. You need one of these newer devices to use this App. See below which older iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch without this sensor are not supported!\n\nThis App features a Barometer for weather, an Altimeter for outdoor activities, a barometric Trend and a Notification Center Widget.\n\nEven without the optional In-App-Purchase this is a fully functional Barometer with absolutely no draw-backs and all important features accessible. Always without ads! (See \"Pro Features\" at the end). No internet connection required, no data transmitted - runs on your device only!\n\nKeep an eye on the barometric pressure and be your own weather forecast! This little app uses only GPS (optional) and the new barometric pressure sensor to calculate the barometric pressure used in weather forecasts. The new iPhones have a barometric pressure sensor built in so this app works completely without internet. The handy marker helps you keep track of changes in the barometric pressure and let's you predict weather changes! Please realize, that a single barometric pressure reading is not enough to tell the current weather situation but the barometric pressure and its change over time is a very good indicator for weather changes!\n\nNow you can also see the trend in barometric pressure with graph charts displaying the measurements taken during the last 30 days! (6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d)\n\nThe Altimeter helps you track your altitude changes based on the change of pressure. Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for checking how high up the mountain you have climbed (works for other activities too). The App does not use GPS for the Altimeter.\n\nPlease Note that on older devices such as the 4S, 5, 5S and 5C as well as on any iPod Touch and iPad Models older than iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4 as well as the Apple Watch 1 and 2, this app will not be able to read barometric pressure values and not display any useful information. The first generation 4-inch iPhone SE is not supported - the new SE (2020) is!\n\nAll basic features, the Barometer, the Altimeter, the Trend and the Widget are completely free to use for everyone and are fully functional at maximum accuracy available. No ads!\nThe only features with restricted access via In-App-Purchase are listed at the end under \"Pro Features\". Those are nice to have features for power users or those that want to show their support for the App!\n\nFeatures (free for everyone)\n- Barometer for weather\n- Altimeter for outdoor activities\n- HomeScreen Widget (iOS 14 and newer)\n- Today-View Widget (all Versions)\n- Watch App\n- Up to 30d trend visualised with graphs\n- Interactive timeline on the trend graphs\n- No internet connection required since the sensor is built into the new iPhones and iPads\n- Supports 6 different pressure units\n- Support for 2 different altitude units\n- Analog Barometer with support for all 6 units\n- Configurable \"displayed accuracy\" / number of decimals\n- Supports setting a custom marker so you can track changes in barometric pressure\n- Manual altitude setting or automatic altitude updates based on GPS for the Barometer.\n- GPS Correction. In case your GPS seems to always be 'off' a little you can now fix this easily.\n- Portrait and Landscape support\n- No ads! No data collection beyond your device (history and settings). No web communication at all.\n\nPro Features (one time In-App Purchase required)\n- Change the Barometer Face\n- Fishing Barometer\n- Two scales on the Barometer\n- Data export in CSV Format"

It also displays the current temperature and humidity.\n• Display barometric pressure (sensor value) or mean sea level pressure (MSLP - value used in weather forecast services or stations).\n• Units support for pressure: mb, inHg, kPa, atm, Torr, psi, hPa, mmHg. Units for altitude: meter, feet.\n• Calibrate the barometer using altitude/location from the GPS. Calibrate the altimeter using the nearest airport information/METAR, or manually enter the QNH of the nearest airport. Offset sensor output value.\n• Measure the height (building/mountain/hiked/climbed) using the \"Relative Altitude\" feature (can be enabled in the app's Settings).\n• Notification about pressure change. \"Notification custom rule\" for you to define how and when the app sends notifications.\nNotify when air pressure changes indicate that extreme or worse weather may occur.\n• \"Pressure Tracking\" and \"History Graph\" require \"Background App Refresh\" or \"Always Location Service\" with \"Exact update interval\" (paid feature) enabled.\n• \"My Area\" allows you to define your frequent stay places, and the app tracks air pressure with location data.\n• Export history to CSV format and Today widget (paid features).\n• This app is the digital version compared with an aneroid or mercury barometer and can be adjusted to MSLP with additional features.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE:\nYou can change your barometer/altimeter appearance with:\n• Seven different housing colors.\n• Black, white or blue disk background.\n• Four different app backgrounds.\n• Three different types of needles.\n• Marker needle for easily monitor.\n• Dark or light Today widget theme.\n\nNOTES:\n• App only works on devices with a barometer sensor, such as iPhone 6/6s/7/8/X/11/12/13 (including Plus models), iPad Mini 4/Air 2/Pro, or later.\n• Weather icons on the dial: This only shows the air pressure trend like in an analog barometer.\n• Each time your device reboots, open the app for tracking with the \"Exact update interval\" feature work.\n• You may take the phone/tablet far away from computers, cables, and other magnetic sources to get accurate results.\n\nIf you like this app, please support us - you can remove ads or unlock paid features from the menu: Shop.\nWe welcome your ideas and suggestions - please email us at: support+barometer@pvdapps.com.\nFollow our official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/barometerplus/ or Twitter account: https://twitter.com/pvdapps."

Devices with built-in sensors will get values from it and for those without sensors, the pressure value is reported by the nearest weather station.\n\nWith our clean and intuitive app, you can see the  current pressure with just one look. You can save any current value to compare pressure from other days. What's coolest is that you can swipe through multiple units and instantly see the pressure in the value you are interested in, including:\n- pounds per square inch\n- millibar\n- hectopascal\n- kilopascal\n- millimeter of mercury\n- bar\n- inch of mercury\n\nYou can also change preferred units in settings.\n\nWith one screen swipe, you can see an altimeter gauge with current values, our precise altitude calculation algorithms (which involve GPS, network services and calibrated pressure sensors) we deliver you the most accurate elevation info as possible, in barometric units or if you prefer, you can swipe over to metric and imperial units.\n\nThe third screen of the application has clear, accurate weather info, which includes:\n- temperature\n- wind speed\n- wind direction\n- humidity\n- cloudiness\n- dew point temperature\n- fog\n\nDevices with pressure sensors now have the possibility to switch from average elevation reported on the Altimeter screen to barometer-based elevation only You are also now able to calibrate with your own mean sea level pressure value.\n\nThe history screen has been redesigned and you can now choose from four different values - MSL pressure, ground level pressure, temperature and elevation. You can also now easily filter data according to any time span you want.\n\nA brand-new functionality of custom notifications has also been added. You can now add time-based notifications: just setup the time and days on which you want to receive notifications with current pressure values and voila. You can also set a pressure level alarm, above or below which the device will warn you. What’s even more, you can receive notifications after pressure changes by the value you set.\n\nAn autosave function is now available. You can set a time interval at which your device will automatically save pressure, temperature and elevation values to give you up to the minute information about weather changes.\n\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/barometer\r\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/barometer"

We take weather conditions like cloud cover, visibility, time of day etc. along with aurora score to generate a score that can help you find the aurora visibility times for a gives city. Along with aurora, weather conditions are also predicted for up to 4 days. We also let users checkin an aurora sighting and alert based on that.\n\nWe track ~24K cities around the world for aurora activity and weather conditions. It is easy to get started by subscribing to alerts for multiple cities and get alerted on the app for free. Realtime aurora map shows the aurora activity on the map and you can interact with the map to select the cities we are tracking from map and having activity at that time. Aurora Travel destination searching is easier with this and with our city search page you can search by city or country for viewing the city aurora forecast report and subscribe to cities for alerts. You can favorite the cities for quick accesses in the future even if you are not registered with an account.\n\nAs we track city specific aurora scores, we cover cities under the northern lights (aurora borealis), southern lights (aurora australis) and even cities where aurora hasn't occurred till date. Web page has sighting specific pages to chat on realtime aurora sighting, this will be released soon in the app version too. \n\nEnjoy hunting auroras with AuroraReach and find your next aurora destination with this app."

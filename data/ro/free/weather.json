It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

      "label": "This app uses the barometric pressure sensor built into all the newer iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch Models sold after 2016 with few exceptions. You need one of these newer devices to use this App. See below which older iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch without this sensor are not supported!\n\nThis App features a Barometer for weather, an Altimeter for outdoor activities, a barometric Trend and a Notification Center Widget.\n\nEven without the optional In-App-Purchase this is a fully functional Barometer with absolutely no draw-backs and all important features accessible. Always without ads! (See \"Pro Features\" at the end). No internet connection required, no data transmitted - runs on your device only!\n\nKeep an eye on the barometric pressure and be your own weather forecast! This little app uses only GPS (optional) and the new barometric pressure sensor to calculate the barometric pressure used in weather forecasts. The new iPhones have a barometric pressure sensor built in so this app works completely without internet. The handy marker helps you keep track of changes in the barometric pressure and let's you predict weather changes! Please realize, that a single barometric pressure reading is not enough to tell the current weather situation but the barometric pressure and its change over time is a very good indicator for weather changes!\n\nNow you can also see the trend in barometric pressure with graph charts displaying the measurements taken during the last 30 days! (6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d)\n\nThe Altimeter helps you track your altitude changes based on the change of pressure. Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for checking how high up the mountain you have climbed (works for other activities too). The App does not use GPS for the Altimeter.\n\nPlease Note that on older devices such as the 4S, 5, 5S and 5C as well as on any iPod Touch and iPad Models older than iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4 as well as the Apple Watch 1 and 2, this app will not be able to read barometric pressure values and not display any useful information. The first generation 4-inch iPhone SE is not supported - the new SE (2020) is!\n\nAll basic features, the Barometer, the Altimeter, the Trend and the Widget are completely free to use for everyone and are fully functional at maximum accuracy available. No ads!\nThe only features with restricted access via In-App-Purchase are listed at the end under \"Pro Features\". Those are nice to have features for power users or those that want to show their support for the App!\n\nFeatures (free for everyone)\n- Barometer for weather\n- Altimeter for outdoor activities\n- HomeScreen Widget (iOS 14 and newer)\n- Today-View Widget (all Versions)\n- Watch App\n- Up to 30d trend visualised with graphs\n- Interactive timeline on the trend graphs\n- No internet connection required since the sensor is built into the new iPhones and iPads\n- Supports 6 different pressure units\n- Support for 2 different altitude units\n- Analog Barometer with support for all 6 units\n- Configurable \"displayed accuracy\" / number of decimals\n- Supports setting a custom marker so you can track changes in barometric pressure\n- Manual altitude setting or automatic altitude updates based on GPS for the Barometer.\n- GPS Correction. In case your GPS seems to always be 'off' a little you can now fix this easily.\n- Portrait and Landscape support\n- No ads! No data collection beyond your device (history and settings). No web communication at all.\n\nPro Features (one time In-App Purchase required)\n- Change the Barometer Face\n- Fishing Barometer\n- Two scales on the Barometer\n- Data export in CSV Format"

Log.\n\nGarmin Pilot is the most comprehensive suite of tools for the iPad designed specifically for general aviation and corporate pilots. Flight planning, charts, interactive maps, weather briefing resources and navigation capabilities; it’s all included. The app’s intuitive interface mirrors those on the newest Garmin touchscreen avionics so you can go seamlessly from preflight to inflight.  \n\nPlan \n\nGarmin Pilot’s powerful capabilities start with pre-flight planning, providing pilots with the most comprehensive aviation weather information to make better-informed flight decisions. Pilots can check NEXRAD radar, visible and infrared cloud imagery, METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, NOTAMs, winds and temperature aloft, TFRs and lightning data. With Garmin Pilot, data can be displayed over Garmin’s interactive maps that support track-up navigation, VFR sectional or an IFR low or high en-route chart to visualize the weather for your route. Add text-based weather widgets and use the exclusive NavTrack feature to view weather along the planned route. \n\nFile \n\nWith Garmin Pilot, users can easily enter a flight plan and interactively edit it on the map. Pre-loaded forms make it quick to save and reuse data for frequently flown routes. And when the flight plan is ready, Garmin Pilot makes it simple to file, amend or close the flight plan via Leidos Flight Service or DUATS.  \n\nFly \n\nGarmin Pilot provides full en-route navigation capability on its moving map. Pilots can also navigate with Garmin’s patented panel, a GPS-driven instrument pack with a graphical HSI directional display and indicators for groundspeed, altitude and vertical speed. After takeoff, pilots can continue to view real-time weather in the U.S. and traffic information by wirelessly connecting to Garmin’s GDL 39 3D portable ADS-B Receiver (sold separately). \n\nLog\n\nGarmin Pilot includes a comprehensive electronic logbook that syncs with flyGarmin.  The logbook automatically generates entries based upon GPS data collected during the flight, tracks currency, supports manual entries, endorsements and creates reports.\n\nGarmin Pilot U.S. Standard: \n\n- Rich, interactive maps support Track-Up navigation\n- Charts: VFR Sectionals, low and high IFR en-route, airport diagrams and approach procedures \n- Ability to view Jeppesen Terminal Charts  (Jeppesen echart subscription required)\n- Weather Maps: Animated radar, Infrared and Visible Satellite, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Lightning, TFRs and more!\n- Extensive text products: METARs, TAFs, Winds Aloft, PIREPs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Area Forecasts and NOTAMs \n- AOPA Airport Directory\n- Weight and Balance\n- Checklists\n- Flight plan filing via Leidos Flight Services\n- Garmin patented navigation panel \n- Terrain and Obstacles\n- Smart Airspace\n- Fast Find predictive Waypoint Entry\n- Logbook\n- Optional VFR Premium: Synthetic Vision (SVX), Terrain and obstacle alerting, and Garmin SafeTaxi®  \n- Optional IFR Premium: VFR Premium plus geo-referenced Garmin FliteCharts® \n\nGarmin Pilot has regional offerings for Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America.

      "label": "Meteobot is a weather station app, specialized for precision farming. It gives you real-time information about the weather and soil conditions in your fields – directly from your Meteobot weather station. \n\nCURRENT WEATHER AND SOIL DATA\n\nWith Meteobot you get the following data, updated as often as 10 minutes:\n- Rain – amount (l/m2) and intensity (l/h)\n- Soil temperature\n- Soil moisture – at up to 3 different depths\n- Аir temperature\n- Air humidity\n- Air pressure\n- Wind speed\n- Wind direction\n- Leaf wetness\n\nHISTORICAL DATA\n\nAll data is stored securely in the Meteobot cloud for an unlimited period of time. Thus, there are no gaps or omissions – as compared to manual records keeping on paper.\n\nLOCAL WEATHER FORECAST\n\nMeteobot provides you with a local weather forecast for the specific area you are interested in. The weather forecast is for 10 days ahead. For the first two days, data is provided on an hourly basis, and from day 3 to day 10 – in 6 hours’ periods. The forecast is global. Its spatial accuracy is 8 km. The forecast is generated by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, whose weather model was named one of the most precise in the world.\n\nAGRONOMIC INDICATORS\n\nBased on data from weather stations, the Meteobot app calculates the following essential agronomic indicators:\n- Rain sum\n- Precipitation on weekly and monthly basis\n- Temperature sum\n- Average daily temperature\n- Leaf wetness duration (hours)\n\nAGROMETEOROLOGICAL HISTORY\n\nBecause Meteobot is specialized for farming, it keeps weather stations data in your fields’ history. The only thing you need to do is to outline the boundaries of your fields on the map. Once you have done it, you get a complete agro-meteorological history from the moment a weather station was installed nearby. The main advantage of Meteobot is that you receive data from your own weather station (or from another one nearby), and not from a weather device miles away from your land.\n\nMETEOROLOGICAL ALERTS\n\nUsing data from weather stations, Meteobot® App calculates and sends alerts for the following agro-meteorological indicators:\n- Average daily temperature above 10⁰С\n- Average soil temperature above 10⁰С\n- Intensive precipitation (more than 1 liter / min.)\n- First autumn chill\n- Spring chill"

      "label": "Meteoradar – nejpřesnější předpověď srážek pro Česko\n\nAplikace Meteoradar je jednou z nejstahovanějších aplikací na iPhone a iPad. Aplikace nabízí řadu zajímavých funkcí. Zobrazí nejen aktuální srážky nad Českem, ale i jejich předpověď na následující hodinu. Nechybí ani údaje o aktuálních teplotách, větru, srážkách nebo stavu počasí. Meteoradar umožňuje sledovat vývoj počasí téměř v reálném čase. Data jsou aktualizována každých 10 minut.\n\n* Srážky a jejich předpověď (radar)\nAplikace na mapě zobrazí aktuální srážky nad Českem a Německem s přesností až 1 km. Nechybí ani předpověď jejich vývoje na následující hodinu (dostupné u českého radaru). Přesně tak poznáte, kdy přeháňka dorazí přímo do vašeho města. Radarové snímky Česka poskytuje ČHMÚ a snímky Německa poskytuje DWD.\n\n* Údaje z meteostanic\nNa mapě jsou dostupné údaje z více než 150 meteorologických stanic. Meteorologické stanice zaznamenávají teplotu, vítr, srážky ale i vlhkost nebo tlak vzduchu. U každé stanice je v grafu uveden vývoj teploty.\n\n* Blesky\nV případě bouřek aplikace zobrazí i místa, kde uhodil blesk. Na základě radarového snímku potom poznáte, jak se bude bouřka nadále vyvíjet.\n\n* Meteozprávy\nAplikace zobrazuje informace o počasí přímo od uživatelů, kteří sledují počasí v daných místech.\n\n* Přidávejte informace o počasí\nAplikace umožňuje zasílat informace o počasí ve vaší lokalitě. Pokud se u vás vyskytuje například silná bouřka, stačí v aplikaci vytvořit hlášení o počasí, které si následně přečtou stovky lidí. Přidat můžete aktuální fotografii či popis počasí.

In addition to viewing current air quality conditions, using Local Haze allows you to share sensor maps displaying air quality readings anywhere in the world.\n\nThe World Health Organization and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have developed guidelines for safe air quality as impacted by chemical pollutants and particulate matter (PM).   PM smaller than 10 micrometers poses problems because it can enter the bloodstream. Local Haze displays the level of smaller PM 2.5 particles, which pose the most significant risk to health.\n\nNotifications: New subscription feature in version 2.1 of Local Haze!\n\nNow you can subscribe to receive a notification when there is a significant change in the air quality readings for sensors by PurpleAir, Sensor.Community and uRADMonitor. To set a notification, tap on the bell icon on any PurpleAir sensor detail screen. Notifications will be sent to your phone when the air quality changes.\n\nTerms of Use: https://localhaze.humanlogic.com/tou\nPrivacy Policy: https://localhaze.humanlogic.com/privacy\n\nHow Local Haze displays air quality data\n\nLocal Haze displays the EPA’s Air Quality Index (AQI) and a confidence rating for each sensor reading. The confidence rating is a feature that is unique to Local Haze and depends on many factors, including sensor maintenance and data freshness.\n \nEach AQ sensor reading is displayed according to the key below, with a badge on the lower right that represents a confidence rating:\n \nGreen Face: Air quality is Good.\nAir quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.\n \nYellow Face: Air quality is Moderate.\nAir quality is acceptable. For some pollutants, there may  be a moderate health concern.\n \nOrange Face: Air quality is Unhealthy for sensitive groups.\nThe general public is not likely to be affected, but persons with heart & lung disease, older adults and children, are  at greater risk from the presence of ozone or particles.\n\nRed Face: Air quality is Unhealthy\nEveryone may begin to experience some adverse health effects, and members of the sensitive groups may experience more serious effects.\n\nBlack face mask with respirator: Air quality is Hazardous.\nEveryone may experience more serious health effects with possible emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected. \n\n\nNote: The source for the above AQ index classification is Air Quality Index (AQI) Basics - EPA\n\nThe confidence rating badges are:\n\n\nGreen badge with thumbs up: High confidence in the air sensor reading.\n\nYellow badge with OK sign: OK confidence in the air sensor reading.\n\nRed badge with thumbs down: Low confidence in the air sensor reading.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using Local Haze!

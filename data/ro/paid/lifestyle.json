When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

The theory is that spirits can manipulate the sensors to choose the word that they wish to speak. The app sets a baseline for what is considered \"normal\" activity among the senors used. This baseline is then monitored for abnormal fluctations. To avoid having normal activity or handling disrupt the baseline we are using a modified version of a quantum fluctuation calculation that employs a new method with handling deltas. \n\nPlease note that the results of this application cannot be verified scientifically so this application is for entertainment purposes only."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

An alarm that irritates me enough to wake up\n √ Exceptional App!! This app is super super annoying... It really gets me out of bed\n √ Love it. It's the best alarm ever\n √ Great Alarm! Been having trouble getting up. No more!\n √ This app is so easy to use, and has all the perfect functions! I'll never be late again!\n\nFEATURED IN THE MEDIA\n √ Definitely one of the more “annoying” alarms to help you get up and out of bed in the morning. – AppAdvice.com\n √ If you are the kind of person who has a difficult time waking up after you’ve turned off your alarm, this app may help keep you from being late for work. - iDownloadBlog\n\nAlso in MacWorld NL, AppsRumors, AppChronicles, etc.\n\nHOW IT WORKS \n\nAs the name \"Step Out!\" implied, the only way you can turn off this alarm clock is STEPPING out of your bed (you still can snooze - in a limited duration). It uses advanced image recognition and step tracking technologies to check whether you’re far away from your bed. \n\nAfter ringing, the app asks you to capture another photo of a specified place, it should be where you usually be every time you wake up, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, ... So you just take a photo and do your routine work like washing your face or preparing breakfast. \n\nAnother alternative is using the step counter, which simplifies this process into just nothing. You wake up and go to wherever you want with the device. After reaching enough number of steps, the alarm will automatically turn off. It’s simply a smarter alarm with no additional action., You’ll love using it from the very first time. \n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n\n- MUSIC ALARM \no Wake up with your favorite songs\no Listen to them when moving\n\n- FULLY FUNCTIONAL ALARM \no Easy setup with hand-drawn mini-game\no Repeating rule for daily, weekly alarms \no Built-in alarm sounds \no Snooze, Vibrate, Fade-in & Volume for the perfect experience \n\n- MOTION TRACKING \no Innovative motion tracking system to sense your steps\no Smart anti-cheat system to make sure that you are stepping\n\n**IMPORTANT: We do not encourage our users to step so fast when you are not totally awake, this app will just recognize the steps when you aren’t walking too fast.\n\n- IMAGE RECOGNITION\no State-of-the-art image recognizing engine\no Can match both horizontal and vertical pictures\no Strict image comparison to assure you’re leaving your bed and your eyes opened wide enough to take the right picture.\n\n**HINT: Choose a scene that has a stable light condition for better matching results.\n\n- SLEEP TIMER \no Fall asleep with music \no Auto-lock and ready for next alarm \n\n- FLASHLIGHT \no Easy to find way through the dark when you are stepping\n\n- CLOCK \no Full feature clock \no Show/hide seconds, 24 hour format, …"

      "label": "NEWS:\nFamily Tracker was used to locate a missing child - see news report on: http://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-app-missing-idUSBRE8460GZ20120507\n\n***SUPPORT NOTICE**** \nWe do help everyone who contacts us via our iphone@logsat.com email address, but unfortunately most users give bad ratings without ever contacting us for support. Please do contact us if you have any issues, we're always there to help! \n*************** \n\nFamily Tracker allows you to track your wife, husband, children and fiancée. You can now find out where they are, at anytime, as long as they have their phones with them. Family Tracker is available for other platforms as well, so you can track (and be tracked by) other devices as well - check our website for more details. \n\nPlease note that starting with the new iOS4 and supported hardware, Family Tracker runs in the background at all times, and, unlike previous versions of Family Tracker, user intervention is **NOT** needed for you to track them. Family Tracker runs at all times, continuously updating the GPS location of the device. Even if the iPhone is rebooted, Family Tracker will automatically resume tracking and updating its position! \n\nSo how does this work? \n\nSimple. Install Family Tracker on the iPhone/iPad you want to track. From then on, you can use either a web browser or via the Family Tracker app itself installed on your own iPhone/iPad to locate your family member. \n\nIf the device you wish to track does not support multitasking (for example, older iPhones 3G, iPads), you can still use Family Tracker to locate the family member. Using the web or your own iPhone, you will be able to \"ping\" the other iPhone. This is done by sending the other iPhone a (free) “Apple Push Notification” which will cause an alert to sound on your family member’s iPhone, even if the phone in is stand-by, just as would happen if the iPhone receives an SMS. As soon as this alert is acknowledged, their GPS position will be recorded, and their location will be updated on a map. If you are using an iPhone yourself to track them, you will be sent a Push Notification to inform you that the family member has accepted your \"ping\". These notifications will be automatically re-sent every 60 seconds until they are acknowledged. If the recipient is trying to ignore them or does not hear them, this repetition will help acknowledging them. \n\nFamily Tracker does not need to know your iPhone cell number to function, as it does not send SMS messages for notifications. Your email address is instead used to send free Apple Push Notifications to the iPhones being tracked. These notifications are free, specific to our Family Tracker application, and work anywhere in the world as long as the iPhone and/or iTouch being tracked has internet access via the cellular network or WiFi. \n\nNotice: ***Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.*** For this reason, we strongly recommend users to configure Family Tracker to use the \"Driving Only\" accuracy in the GPS setting. This special mode updates the GPS location only when a significant location change occurs, which results in a tremendous gain in battery life.\n\nAdditional pro features, such as the ability to see the past locations for the previous 2 weeks, and the ability to set geofences so you are alerted when users that you track enter or leave certain areas are available via an optional iTunes subscription.\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions are available for either $1.99/month, or $5.99/3 months, or $9.99/6 months or $19.99/year. Privacy policy & terms of use: http://logsat.com/family-tracker-privacy.asp"

It also provides a description for each phase, sign and mansion. You can navigate through the information in various ways — say, phase-by-phase, day-by-day or month-by-month - whatever is more convenient for you. \n\nPhases show you the energy of the day, signs — the mood of the day, while the void-of-course periods might tell you when it is better not to do certain things. Mansions were used by different cultures from the time immemorial, they tell for what a particular day is good or not so good.\n\nTo calculate the times, iLuna uses the time zone of the device on which it runs, so if your iPhone or iPod touch shows your current time correctly, iLuna's information is precise too.\n\nOnce any of the events reported by iLuna happens, you will get a notification, provided you allowed the app to send you notifications."

All you need to know is one of the sizes — the application will tell the rest. Making a shopping trip to another country, online purchasing and an unexpected gift to your beloved will be easier when you can convert sizes on the go.\n\nWhy do we make Sizer?\n\nToday there is no easy way to order clothes online and be sure that it will fit on you well. Size charts do not help, because the size varies and depends on the brand, season, style and region. Size is the reason for the return of 30% of purchased goods online.\n\nSizer is designed to solve this problem - a smart algorithm that learns based on user data:\n1) be brave in online shopping;\n2) forget about returns;\n3) save shopping from stress.\n\n\nHow does Sizer work?\n\n1. You select sizes with the help of our algorithm.\n2. With the help of a button you give feedback - fit or didn’t fit.\n3. Sizer teaches the sizing algorithm.\n\nShopping is no longer a lottery with Sizer.\n\n\n\"An application that remembers that last year your jeans were two sizes smaller.\"\nGQ Russia\n\n\"You could've just said \"We have Beautiful Pixels!\". Seriously, loved the app.\"\n— BeautifulPixels.com"

      "label": "Want to display or send SSTV transmissions, without using a bulky computer? SSTV Pad lets you decode and display Ham (Amateur) Radio SSTV (Slow Scan TV) transmissions. Just connect your device to an HF radio (or even set it next to the radio's speaker), tune in an SSTV frequency, and watch the pictures. SSTV Pad decodes all of the popular SSTV modes, including Robot, Scottie, Martin, and more. Some modes are receive only. \n\nDecoding of SSTV transmissions begins automatically as soon as the start of image audio signals are detected, and the image format is automatically selected. Manual control is also available for use when receiving conditions are poor. Timing signals (phase and skew) can be adjusted to compensate for mismatches with the sending station. \n\nReceived images can be saved - including automatically as they are received. You can leave the app running unattended, and come back to view all the received images. You can review saved images, as well as send them via email, and use iTunes file sharing to transfer them to your computer. You can even share them on your Facebook page, or tweet them to your followers, directly from the app! (iOS 6 and later)\n\nYou can also transmit images, taken from your saved photos or taken with your device's camera. Text, such as your callsign, can be added to the sent image.\n\nBuy your copy right now, and start decoding and displaying SSTV transmissions in minutes. Just set your iPhone or iPad next to the radio speaker, and watch the pictures come rolling in.\n\nNote: If you cannot see the transmit button, go to the Accessibility settings for your device and turn Button Shapes OFF. It makes the buttons too large so you cannot see them all. \n\nAlso, It is very important to have a well tuned signal of good quality, and make sure you get the audio from your radio to your device without adding additional distortion, or auto start and mode detect will not work optimally. Please see this page for tips on using the app and connecting your radio: http://www.blackcatsystems.com/ipad/iPad_SSTV_Pad_FAQ.html\n\nYou can also use Bluetooth audio devices to feed audio into your device. Please be sure to use a good quality Bluetooth device, that does not distort the audio.\n\nModes supported for reception (not all modes can be transmitted):\nB&W 8 sec\nB&W 12 sec\nB&W 24 sec\nB&W 36 sec \nMartin M1\nMartin M1\nMartin M2\nMartin M3\nMartin M4\nMP73\" \nMP115 \nMP140 \nMP175\nMR73 \nMR90\nMR115 \nMR140 \nMR175 \nPD 50\nPD 90 \nPD 120 \nPD 160\nPD 180\nPD 240\nPD 290 \nRobot 12C\nRobot 24C\nRobot 36C\nRobot 72C\nSC-1 32 sec\nSC-1 16 sec\nSC-1 8 sec\nSC-2-60\nSC-2-120\nSC-2-180\nScottie S1\nScottie S2\nScottie S3\nScottie S4\nScottie DX"

Delicious. \n\n5 Star - Fantastic!! \n(UK iTunes review)\nI didn't think that this application would be up to the same standard set by the book (which is THE definitive cocktail bible), but I couldn't have been more wrong! It's every bit as informative as the book, and the fact that it's interactive - it lists the cocktails that you can make from the drinks in your cabinet - makes it even easier to use. And at the price of half a pint of beer, it's astonishingly under-priced for such a brilliant application.\n\n5 Star - Marvelous \n(UK iTunes review)\nLooks as good as the books, fits in the pocket......."

      "label": "What’s your personality? How do you and your loved ones, friends, and co-workers compare? Imagine having quick access to the right keywords to get your point across!\n\nWhether you’re in a boring meeting, on the phone with a challenging client, or dealing with a flustered family member — this application is for you. The essential themes of each personality Type are just a tap away. You can also explore each personality in depth: learn a person’s core needs and values, cognitive processes, interaction style, team behavior, pitfalls, growth points, and much more.\n\nYou will quickly learn about Type Theory and how to positively influence others using the “Compare” feature. This feature relies on sophisticated algorithms to show you the likely commonalities, differences, and synergies between two people. The algorithms compare communication, problem solving, learning and adaptation, love relationships, growth and change, and more.\n\nIN DEPTH:\nPersonality is far more than just superficial traits. Personality reveals motivation and cognition — why (and how) people act. In short, this application helps you discover what makes people “tick”. When you know why someone needs something, or how they prefer to go about doing a task or interaction, then you have leverage to improve the situation. \n\nFor almost six decades, thousands of successful professionals — counselors, teachers, managers, coaches, salespeople, and others — have used the insights of Type Theory. Type Theory is supported by decades of published statistical analysis of over six million people.\n\nThe famous and highly respected Dr. Carl Jung first described eight cognitive processes people use. The eight processes combine to match the sixteen personality Types. Thus, when you learn about Type Theory, you learn what occurs on the inside; in a person’s head and heart — and how they relate back-and-forth with others. No other personality theory can give you this picture.\n\nThis application is ideal for serious students of psychology. Learning about ourselves and others is not done by simply “taking a test” that “tells” us who we are. Although we include multiple personality assessments, genuine learning for adults involves continual exploration and reflection. This application gives you tools; you the one who brings the curiosity and patience for discovery.\n\nEXPERTISE:\nThis application is the work of renowned Type Theorist and UCLA lecturer Dario Nardi, PhD, author of numerous books on personality psychology, cognition, neuroscience, and self-leadership. Dr. Nardi has worked with many other experts, including practicing organizational development consultants and psychologists. What you get is the product of many minds and personalities, not just one.\n\nFEATURES:\n•   Save Multiple Personality Assessments and Profiles For Reference\n•   Includes Three Personality Assessments: “Short Form”, “Long Form”, and “Standard-Form”\n•   Essential Details of the Well-Known 16 Personality Types (“ESTJ”, “INFP”, etc) by Isabel Briggs-Myers\n•   Keywords to Apply Subtle Influence on Others\n•   A Super “Compare” Feature to Pinpoint and Manage Commonalities and Differences Between Any Two Personality Types\n•   An Explanation of Type Theory with Links to Handy Online Resources"

You can also use iDay to create special manual entries, which means there’s no need to have a separate address book entry for your Aunt Gwen or dog Snoopy, even if you want to be reminded of their birthdays as well.\n\nREMEMBER YOUR FIRST DATE AND ANNIVERSARY\nEnsure you’ll always remember the anniversary of your first date with your husband or wife, as well as your wedding anniversary. You can also organize your children’s school holidays and vacation periods, and enter any other special days, including your own personal vacation times – basically any day or period you want to be reminded of.\n\nLOTS OF USEFUL INFORMATION EVERY DAY\niDay’s summary page displays the applicable Zodiac sign for that day, as well as Chinese and Indian Horoscopes, the Celtic Tree Horoscope, and helpful links related to all of these features. You can also view the moon phase for the selected day, as well as the Saint associated with it. In addition, you can obtain facts about the date by following links to Wikipedia, and the daily calendars and “On This Day” sections of the New York Times and the BBC. Other links provide information on famous people born and historical events that took place on that day. \n\nSEND BIRTHDAY E-MAILS TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY \nSurprise your friends and family by sending them best wishes for their birthday directly from the App via phone calls, text messages, or a very special e-mail containing personal horoscope and other data, which is automatically composed by the summary page. \n\nONE APP IS ALL YOU NEED \nDon’t waste your valuable time and money on several small Apps; instead, take advantage of the extensive range of information and functions offered by iDay Deluxe, whose integrated backup function also ensures the highest level of security for your data.\nMacLife 3/11/09 (App of the Week): iDay - “Never forget a birthday again” \n\nImportant note:  iDay does not come with preset holidays (this feature will be available in one of the upcoming updates). All holidays can be entered by users manually, however. \n\nYOU NEED HELP?\nPlease have a look at the FAQ section on our website www.ihanwel.com. If you need further assistance, please send us an email.\n\nPUSH SERVICE FOR FREE\nWith release 3.0 iDay supports the Apple Push Notifications Service to push not only the updating of the badge once a day then also a message on a free definable hour for upcoming events on this day. Both without a need to start iDay. So you never will forget important days!"

Good luck.\"\n\n-- That's what I believe for this app.\n\n## Suggest new scenes\nWant to suggest new scenes? Visit @lightshue on Instagram and let me know!

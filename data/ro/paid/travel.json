As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not.

WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade.

      "label": "Touring Romania\n  The second guidebook of the Carpathian 2 Wheels Guide project: Touring Romania proposes 28 routes on tarmac that cover all the regions of the country.\n  The majority of the routes, 21 of them, are covering the historical regions of Romania like: Maramures, Banat, Transilvania or Dobrogea. The other 7 take the travelers on the major mountain passes of the Carpathian Mountains. All of these have a duration of one or two days. \n   For a longer adventure in Romania at the end of the guide 5 longer routes (up to 8 days) have been proposed by combining the 28 routes.\n\n  All the mentioned routes are integrated in the mobile app and, for each route you can access:\n     - the starting point, duration, total length and the difficulty\n     - detailed description of the route\n     - contact details from the accommodations\n     - details and photos of the recommended sights\n     - the main cities that indicate the route direction\n\n The most important function of the app is the navigation. Each route is marked in the map and also all the elements mentioned above (sights, accommodation, gas stations, etc.). Also you have the Night Mode option, a minimal contact color scheme for the rides that go into the night."

If you ever wonder where you are, your altitude, ground speed, direct distance to your destination in Miles, Nautical Miles and Kilometers, and how many hours you still have to get there, this app will help you!  \n\n Flight Nav uses GPS signals while in Airplane Mode to display your position, estimated distance, and time to your destination.\n\nYou can record your flight and later share it as a GPX file. This option will consume more battery as it will operate even while you are not using your device.\n\nOther features include a \"Don't sleep\" feature to keep the screen on.\n\n  GPS reception from within an aircraft can sometimes be poor. Best results are with window seats, or close to them, and you might have to wait longer to get results than you would while on the ground. What this means is that you might not get any signal at all, and the app might not work as expected every time, especially if you're sitting in the middle seats of a wide body airplane.\n\nMap detail will not be available at every zoom level - since you will be running offline - and you should use the app before flying, while still connected, in order to cache map information.\n\n  You should only use your device when allowed by the cabin crew - Please, pay attention to the specific instructions regarding mobile devices. If you have doubts about using your device, even with Airplane Mode enabled, please consult the cabin crew.  \n\nYou can add your own destinations by long pressing the map on the location you want.\n\nContinued use of GPS can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "No Signup.  No Login. \n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Francés, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button. You can swipe through all your favorites on the main calculation interface just as you swipe the pages on the iPhone’s home screen.\n\n== Charts and Historic Rates==\neCurrency provides detailed historical charts for all exchange rates. Just rotate the device to landscape, to view the chart for the active currency pair. You can switch the chart display between a 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year or 5-year period. Tap on the chart to display the exact exchange rate tor a particular day. Tap and hold to use a specific exchange rate for historic calculations.\n\n== Exchange Rate Updates ==\neCurrency updates exchange rates automatically on every start-up or on demand. You can turn off automatic updates to avoid roaming costs. The conversion and calculation functionally works completely offline using the latest downloaded exchange rates; the display of historical charts requires an active internet connection.\n\n==Rates Provider==\neCurrency is not dependant on any single data-source. The application obtains its exchange rates from our self-developed Currency-Provider-engine that aggregates rates data from multiple sources to secure the reliability of exchange rate updates.\n\n== Tutorial & Support==\nOn the first startup a short self-running demo is displayed to introduce you to the app. We appreciate any reviews or comments you may have on eCurrency in iTunes. If you have any questions please contact us directly, as we are unable to respond to your enquiries via iTunes."

Follow it as it proceeds among the other traffic. Just tap the small blue dot to exit follow mode and return to the main map.\n\nMultiple Filters\nJust want to see aircraft below 10'000 feet, Boeing 747s or only planes from a certain airline? You can filter by altitude, type, callsign or registration. Filters can be combined, too.\n\nCustomizability\nCustomize the display using many options. You only want to see helicopters and hide all small airports? You can do that and much more...\n\nComplications Support\nWith many different complications available, designed to fit into all color schemes, PlaneWatcher is always just a tap away.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.planewatcher.app/privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://www.planewatcher.app/terms.html"

Experience complete freedom and get value for your money! Use Cuba-Junky’s Casa Particular Directory app as your simple and user friendly ‘Yellow Pages’ while planning, traveling and exploring!\n\nWhy you need this app when you plan to visit Cuba \n- Cuba friendly and explorer friendly (simple, practical and cheap!)\n- Several updates a week with new casas and features \n- Even more casas in the app than on our website\n - Direct contact with the casa through the app\n - Save yourself  $5 per night by using the app to contact the owners directly  \n\nWhat are casas particulares? \nCuba’s version of B&Bs offer the island’s best lodging values for anyone who likes doing things authentically, or in this case: the Cuban way. You can find hundreds of casas in this app. They are rooms, suites, or sometimes entire apartments. The Cuba-Junky casa directory app is current, convenient, and easy to use. It provides casa photos, phone numbers, email addresses, Facebook and website links—all for about US $5!  \n\nOnline, offline and more \nBut there is more. The casa particular directory app is very frequently updated at no extra charge. And you can access other types of info through the app, such as the weather forecast, or use it to contact your casa.\n\n  No commission: save $5 per night! \nBy using this app and contacting a casa directly, you often save the $5 per night commission that the owner normally charges for bookings made through a third party. Casa owners pay no commission or other costs to Cuba Junky. Say this to the casa owner and get that discount!\n\n  Some free Cuba advice?\n Cuba-Junky’s advice is: make a reservation for your first night in Cuba and after that just “go with the flow.” Using your Cuba-Junky casa particular app, it will be easy to find casas while in Cuba, or to call ahead to a casa in the next town you plan to visit. You can talk to the owner directly, find out what’s available, and at what price.   \n\nWhy does this app cost about $5?  \nJust because Cuba Junky have to keep it running. We charge no hidden $5 per night commission. We just love Cuba. If you do too, go and enjoy it, and while you’ re at it, help us keep Cuban locals in the lead! ¡Gracias amigos!"

Luggage fit solves that problem for you and gives your peace of mind that you won't have any issues with your baggage size."

The routes of this guidebook go through the forests, the mountains, on roads which connect medieval castles and that are tracks on riverbanks of the large rivers from Transylvania. Sighișoara, Râșnov and Rupea Citadel, the fortified churches in Biertan and Viscri are major points of reference linked by roads on ridges, dotted with villages spectacular by their simplicity. Apuseni Mountains, Poiana Ruscă, Șureanu and the Eastern Carpathian group of mountains are crossed on dirt roads full of mud and unique landscapes on each turn.\n\n4132 kilometers of adventures \n\nIt is necessary to go beyond the tarmac roads to enjoy the wild beauty of this region. 9 out of the 10 routes are on unpaved or dirt roads, some are difficult others are easier. The off-road tracks total 2654 kilometers and each have lengths between 170 and 450 kilometers.\n\nThe last route, 1508 kilometers long, is the challenge that we have prepared for the tarmac roads lovers. This is the longest track that can link all the touristic attractions of Transylvania and includes the most beautiful mountain passes and secondary roads.\n\nGPS tracks and mobile application\n\nThe digital version of the guide is a mobile application. The GPS tracks of each route are available, to make navigation easier and also not to miss any of the tourist attractions."

Scan the boarding pass and email it to colleagues, family, or friends so they have your updated flight information.\n\nNote that although most airlines follow the barcoded boarding pass standard (we have successfully tested dozens of airlines, around the world), some airlines don't exactly follow the standard.  As we identify them them, we continue update the app to support them.  If you find a Boarding pass that doesn't properly decode, contact our support with a clear photo of your boarding pass, and we will add support for that airline.\n\n-- Please note that this app does not change a paper boarding pass to a mobile boarding pass.  Not all airlines support mobile boarding passes at all stations; please refer to your airline for more information on obtaining mobile boarding passes.

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Street View coverage is displayed in blue.\n\n\nEASY TO USE\nWalking through panoramas has never been easier using the interactive, expandable mini map that also displays your viewing angle and field of view. Virtually traveling abroad is even more immersive and fun with Live Panorama mode: Turn around in the panorama simply by rotating the device.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH APP\nStreets is the only app capable of displaying 360° Street View panoramas on the Apple Watch. Just turn your wrist or pan to turn around in any direction. Use the digital crown to zoom. Streets for Apple Watch automatically syncs favorites and recent searches with your iPhone.\n\n\nOPEN FROM MAPS & OTHER APPS \n“Open location in Streets” displays nearby panoramas from websites, from „Maps“ or „Contacts“, or from many other apps that support sharing of locations and addresses. If you’re already using our location finder app Where To?, you’ll also be able to take advantage of a tight, bidirectional integration.\n\n\nDRAG & DROP\nOn iPad or Mac, drag a pin location from the Maps app, a contact, or a textual address into the Streets app to find nearby panoramas. Even geotagged photos can be dropped in Streets to find 360° spherical images near the photo location.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATIVE\nShare Street View panoramas using drag-and-drop (on iPad) or the share sheet. Handoff and AirDrop let you easily transfer the currently viewed panorama between multiple devices. Mark panoramas as favorites that are automatically synced between devices. Rename favorites and organize them in folders.\n\n\n2000+ GALLERY PLACES \nMore than 2000 hand-picked “Gallery Places” show spectacular places such as museums, castles, national parks, ski slopes and even underwater attractions. Geysers in Yellowstone national park, old masterpieces in Amsterdam’s van Gogh museum or NASA’s rocket launch pad in Cape Kennedy are just a few of the breathtaking places waiting to be explored. Gallery places also include background information such as descriptions and links.\n\n\n\nMORE FEATURES\n- Supports iPad Pro, Split View and Slide Over\n- Supports keyboard navigation (with Bluetooth or Smart Keyboard)\n- Spotlight search also finds Streets panoramas\n- Siri can create reminders with a link to the currently displayed panorama\n- Supports the “Shortcuts” app\n\n\nWHAT OTHERS SAY\n\n“I highly recommend Streets 3.“\n- John Voorhees, MacStories\n\n“it’s hard to imagine Cupertino doing it better than Streets 3”\n4.5/5 mice\n- J.R. Bookwalter, Macworld\n\n“If you haven't migrated to Google Maps on iOS because you're OK with Apple Maps but you miss Google Street View, here's a pretty easy solution.“\n- Mel Martin, Engadget\n\n“Thankfully, with Streets, you can continue using Maps and still be able to quickly pull up Street View without ever feeling like you’ve left the app.“\n- Jordan Khan, 9to5Mac\n\n\nTwitter & Facebook\nCheck us out on Twitter: @futuretap\nand Facebook: http://facebook.com/streetviewapp"

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use DroneMate when you’re traveling.\n\n*U.S. state laws are also included.\n\n*The information is pulled from official sources - there is a lot of misinformation about drone rules and laws floating online - DroneMate gives you a clear listing of the laws, rules, and places where they haven't been completely defined yet.\n\n*Shows information for specific cities, touristic sights, and other areas where drone use has special rules or restrictions.\n\n*DroneMate is updated regularly in real-time with information obtained from a number of official sources.\n\n*DroneMate has a user comment system where travelers can add their experiences droning, importing, and dealing with authorities in each specific country. The comments are useful in situations where the authorities themselves are confused or unaware of the laws, non-common situations, and other anecdotes that can help other travelers.\n\n*Users can also post questions in the comment section for other travelers or the administrator.\n\n*All comments are rated by other users, so the most useful, informative responses are highlighted on top of the others.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade.

It shows informations about the region where a car is registered and links to the maps application, so that you can see on the map where the car is coming from and use the maps application to let it show you the way to that specific location. A global full text search or simple search for plate keys is another part of LicensePlate. Once you've spotted a plate you can mark it and build up your collection of plates you've seen on the street.\n\nThis application is ideal for longer road trips. Be sure to have an answer when your kids play a License Plate quiz again... and hey, i like that Pub quiz idea...! \n\nCountries:\nAustria, Switzerland, Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Greece, Czech Republic, Northern Ireland, Spain, Lithuania, Slovakia, Croatia, Romania, former GDR, Japan, Turkey, Ukraine, Slovenia\n\nNo regional informations, basics:\nBelgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden, Latvia, Hungary"

      "label": "TrekRight – Camino Francés is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking or bicycling the historic Camino de Santiago (specifically, the Camino Francés and the extension from Santiago to Finisterre / Fisterra). \n\nTrekRight includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, albergues, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed *offline* maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass with a built-in yellow arrow that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\n--- The Right Information, When You Need It ---\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching Puente la Reina, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what attractions are available around you, where you can find a water fountain, options for where to stay the night, easy access to interactive elevation profile charts, and clear, detailed directions. You can easily see what things you flagged as interesting, which things you added notes to, and which you marked as favorites. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n--- Caminopedia ---\nTrekRight’s ‘Camino Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information, organized into Communities, Shelters, Attractions, Services, Points of Interest, and Route Sections. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n--- Interactive Offline Maps ---\nPowerful, flexible map that displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Caminopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Caminopedia entry). Easily filter and do searches. Detailed, high-quality offline maps are included, so you have full access to maps even without Internet access. When you do have an Internet connection, online maps are also available which can be configured to show street maps, satellite view, terrain, or a hybrid. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the Camino.\n\n--- Intelligent Compass ---\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Two special compass indicators are available – one points towards the end point of your current section (typically the next town on the route), and the other points which way you should go *now*, taking into consideration your current position and all the twists and turns in your route. Never get lost again!\n\n--- Pre-Camino Planning & Preparation ---\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes including those touted by Brierley and Eroski. Review and rank albergues, flag locations of interest, add your own notes, and more.\n\n--- Up-To-Date Content ---\nTrekRight’s content is regularly updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps. No Internet connection is required!"

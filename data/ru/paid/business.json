      "label": "Nano Hotel Booking - is an application for receiving orders and booking rooms in hotels, recreation centers, health centers, guesthouses. \nAlso, it can be used for daily, hourly, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly renting of real estate, vehicles, construction machinery and any other objects. Application’s versatility makes it suitable for services reservation, for example, at hair salons, car workshops, gyms etc. \n\nThe application is fully compatible with the desktop version (Nano Hotel Booking for OS X).\n\nPrinciples of operation\nThe application is based on a calendar registering the statuses of the hotel rooms (objects). The calendar displays the state of a hotel room on any day of the month. In the hourly rent mode there is a separate calendar for one day divided into 5, 10, 15, 30 or 60 minutes. \nBooked days are highlighted with pink color. For each free day, the room rate is given with regard to seasonal prices. \nTo book a room you need to create an order for this room while specifying the term and the type of a rent. An order can be tied to the client book, or you can simply enter client’s name and phone number directly to the order card. \nYou can book a free room straightforward from the calendar. You can open an order card or a room card from the calendar with one click. Rooms can be made unavailable, for example, for the period of renovation. Rooms and orders can also be labeled with colored tags in order to show their current status.\n\nPricing\nIn a room (object) card you can specify the price and the cost of one day of rent. If you have a lot of rooms, it will be more convenient to create price lists in the settings and tie rooms to them. \nYou can specify daily, hourly, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly prices in the price lists separately. \nYou can enter season prices for each room. Season prices can be tied to the price lists. \nIt is possible to add additional options to each order, such as food, excursions, transfers. There is an indication of each option’s price, as well as whether the price depends on the number of days and the number of guests. \nAn account of the room appliances is kept, i.e. refrigerator, TV, telephone set and so forth.\n\nTypes of rent\n\nDaily\nThis is the main mode of the application. The value of an order is calculated as the price per day multiplied by the number of days or nights, depending on the application settings (see “Settings” – “My Profile”).\n\nHourly\nThe value of an order is calculated as the price per hour multiplied by the number of hours of rent (can be specified accurately to within 5 minutes).\n\nWeekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly\nIn these modes (cyclic orders), the value is calculated as the price per one period (week, month, quarter or year) multiplied by the number of periods that have begun. Let us demonstrate you this through an example. Let’s say the monthly rent is 100 and let’s say today is June 30th. Let’s create an order from July 1st to August 31st with a monthly rent type. In this example, the order amount on June 30th will be 0, as the rent starts only since tomorrow. The order amount on July 1st will be 100. On August 1st the order amount will increase by 100 and will equal 200. On September 1st the amount will not change, as the order ends on August 31st. \nYou can stop a cyclic order at any moment. For this purpose, there is a button “Close cyclic order” in an order card. It will set the order amount equal to the sum of money actually received and the end date to the day of an order closure. \n\nIn all types of rent, the value of options is added to the order amount."

      "label": "This application offers a unique approach to project management, which represents your project not just as a plan, but as a coordinated mechanism moving towards the goal. \n\nThe original technique allows you to break down project objectives into smaller goals, processes and resources, but not get lost in the details, but always see the overall structure of the project as a whole. After all, project management is not a mechanical observance of the plan, but the achievement of project goals, which should not be overlooked.\n\nThe application combines the classic project approach based on Gantt charts and project management through workflow diagrams. As a rule, Gantt charts are ideal for presenting project schedules, but they are not so convenient for reflecting the complex structure of the relationship between processes, goals and resources.\n\nMore formally, the program allows you to build a customized, based on the BPMN notation, PERT diagram of the project (with events and processes at nodes). Then this description of the project is used to generate a Gantt chart and track the progress of the project. \n\nSo, inShort is a powerful project and business process management tool, which can be applied not only in office but also for personal purposes. You can further explore the capabilities of the program with the detailed interactive User Guide.\n\nKey features of the application: \n• Building the diagram of processes and resources of the project (PERT network diagram of the project, based on BPMN notation). \n• The ability to drill down the elements of workflow diagrams. \n• Tracking the execution of the project. \n• Integration with the standard Calendar.\n• Displaying the list of project tasks in the form of a Gantt chart. \n• Separation of physical and information flows of the project. \n• Ability to specify the expected time of execution, both directly and parametrically. \n• Export of charts into PDF files and OPML outlines.\n• Project management according to the methodology of the Theory of Constraints. \n• Working calendars taking into account various schedules of work for implementation of tasks. \n• Work resources and their assignment to tasks. \n• Queues of tasks: organize the work with active tasks in accordance with the elements of the GTD methodology.\n• Checklists for diagrams — monitor the sequence of actions for project management step by step.\n\nAdvanced features of project management in accordance with the Theory of Constraints technique: \n• finding the critical path; \n• positioning of time buffers of the project; \n• calculation of buffer sizes; \n• calculation of late starts for feeding paths of the project; \n• tracking of time indicators during project execution. \n\n***\ninShort Pro — application version for experienced and advanced users, contains advanced and service functions useful for in-depth work with diagrams.\nFunctions included in inShort Pro:\n• Working with layers of diagrams;\n• inReview: publications of user diagrams surveys by experienced project managers, indicating successful findings and weaknesses in the diagrams. The procedure for sending diagrams for analysis is described in the Terms of Use.\n\nThe inShort Pro version is available by monthly subscription. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\ninShort Pro Subscription Terms of Use link: http://www.shortki.com/inShort/proTerms.html\n***\n\nCannot solve a problem?

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "Lecty Audio Recorder Pro is a voice recorder with timecodes. As you create and listen to recordings, you can create timecodes by adding bookmarks, comments, and photos. As a result, you get a visual transcript of the audio recording, consisting of bookmarks, photos and comments, each of which is tied to the time they were added. Using the created timecodes, you can quickly navigate your recordings and instantly rewind the recording to the desired section by simply clicking on the desired timecode. Do you want to start listening to the recording from the moment you added a comment or photo? Just click on the timecode and listen. \n\nEach timecode displays both the time from the beginning of the recording and the time by the clock, for example, 9:41 AM (displayed while listening). It also greatly helps to navigate the notes.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n- Create timecodes with bookmarks, comments and photos\n- Adding timecodes both at the time of recording and while listening\n- Fast rewind to the desired section of the recording by clicking on the timecode\n- Create folders\n- Export of records with all attached data (comments, bookmarks, photos)\n- Ability to slow down or speed up playback\n- Each timecode displays 2 times: 1) time from the beginning of the recording; 2) real time, for example, 9:41 AM\n- Changing the recording quality\n\nOur voice recorder is indispensable for recording lectures, working meetings, conferences, consultations with specialists, as well as when creating music.\n\n______\n\nWe will be glad to receive feedback!

      "label": "Nano Enterprise Management is a simple, yet powerful application for small and medium-sized businesses that helps you efficiently oversee purchases, sales, production, warehouses, and finances right from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch – and all without internet access or any special skills. There is also a desktop version of the app that is fully compatible with the mobile version.\nIn multi-user mode, you can locate the database on the Web hosting and connect to it all your users. To differentiate the users’ permissions in the application, the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented.\n\nThe application's primary purpose is to efficiently manage purchases and product sales for small companies. Nano Enterprise Management is also an excellent fit for any firm that provides services (auto mechanics, hair salons, etc.) or does basic production (assembling computers, crafting furniture, etc.). Thanks to its precise modular structure, all changes in one module are instantly reflected in the others. You can also take advantage of the easy-to-use configuration tool to flexibly adjust settings for various attributes (for example, new products arriving to a warehouse will instantly become available to be ordered while factoring in characteristics such as color, size, material, etc.). The special service planner allows you to flexibly manage resources, personnel, and workstations on the basis of actual load. For example, you could distribute incoming orders to various technicians based on their work schedules, rates, and specializations. All information is visible in real time, so at any time you can check how many orders are currently being processed, how many payments have come in from customers, how much stock is remaining in the warehouse, and how much cash the company has on hand. Deposits and withdrawals have been simplified to the highest degree possible, so even an inexperienced user can easily make sense of them.\n\nAnother major advantage is the attractive, elegant reports with flexible filters that allow you to instantly create excerpts based on the exact time period and data you need at a given moment. The most important information is collected in the \"Marginal Revenue\" report, where you can view your total profits for a selected time interval broken up by region, customer, store, or other factors.\n\nAnd, finally, Nano Enterprise Management stores all data locally (no internet access required), supports data transfer between tablets, and can create backup copies and manage them via email, iCloud, or Dropbox. If you frequently work on a computer or laptop, just install the desktop version of the application (for MacOS), which has the same features as the mobile version.\n\nMoreover, the application is provided along with a tutorial database for your convenience. As soon as you learn your way around the application you can feel free to delete the test data and upload your own.\n\nQuestions?\nPlease email us for help or to give suggestions. We love to hear how businesses are using our app!\n\nE-mail: erziman@gmail.com"

There are more features every day and the game becomes more difficult. Your client holds a pistol? Send him to Hell unless he changes his mind and drops weapons. Is your client a hat-lover? Should you send him to Heaven? No, it's not that easy! First, take the hat off, and you might see the horns. Being a demon, killer, or an angel are features, too. \n\nCatastrophes.\nThese are unique events, they're unexpected and rapid, so Reaper is pressed by time. But you must allocate clients correctly to complete a catastrophe, unlock new clients and increase Death's influence! Unlucky pirates, bear influenza epidemic in Siberia, fighting for a free soup - these are only some of the catastrophes.\n\nEvents.\nEach week you will face a new event. The more days you worked, the more events you have. Trainees' phone calls, safes with smuggled goods, undercover agents of Paradox, kidnappers. They all pose some difficulties but help you to become the best in the biz. Why, you can even cook a soup!\n\nTheme Days.\nEach seventh day is a theme day. You'll choose clients' fate for a unique soundtrack corresponding to the spirit of the chosen theme. Egypt? Certainly! Mother Russia? Nostrovia! Pirate day? Yo-ho-ho!\n\nWhat else?\nHorsemen tasks, funny clients' phrases, lots of references and easter eggs, bonuses, penalties, very special clients - all this will define your future as the Reaper determine the game ending!\n\nGood luck, Reaper!"

But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages.

Send clients to Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory based on the various signs they have. There are tricky clients who interact with each other, interfere with the Reaper's work, or ignore the basic rules, which means you'll have to be extra careful when you're deciding where to send almost everyone.\n\nClients. Many clients are unique individuals. Some of them are even a little famous - but any resemblance to actual people is totally, entirely coincidental. They're not just unique faces, though - they also have unique abilities. For example, Jailers won't let you send prisoners anywhere, Bureaucrats will surprise you with inspections, and the Musketeers are one for all and all for one!\n\nThe Reapers Union. This is where the Reaper goes after every work day just to go to work again! But first you can accept contracts, view jobs from the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, get the latest news from this world, and do super important favors for other Union members. After all, every candidate needs faithful friends when there's an upcoming election.\n\nHorsemen of the Apocalypse. Now that the Union is up and running, the Horsemen finally have time to devote to their beloved side projects. Death's Agency, War's Arena, Pestilence's Laboratory, and Famine's Diner are all open for business!\n\nAnything else? Catastrophes, a rental apartment, a bunch more events, laughs, and maybe even cats. You'll definitely get to do some fishing and listen to awesome music.\n\nGood luck, Mr. Master Reaper!"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

By constantly intertwining and replacing each other, they maintain balance. The main character named OVO was born of these two halves and has the ability to switch between them. OVO travels through the metaphorical world, overcoming dangers and collecting mysterious symbols. These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.\n\nFeatures:\n■\tFlow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black—upward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being carried by a flow.\n\n■\tFascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions.\n\n■\tDesign without words. There is almost no text in the game and the story is told through gameplay and visuals.\n\n■\tMeditative ambient soundtrack by Brokenkites."

A broken household. An evil cult with a mysterious faith. A series of horrifying tragedies. How do these things connect?\n\n「A Fresh Visual Experience with a Unique Art Style」\n\nLife Gallery utilizes a pen-and-ink drawing style and contains more than 50 illustrations, each one immersing the player in the frightening and uncanny world of the story.\n\n「Easy to Control, Tricky to Solve」\n\nEach puzzle in Life Gallery is hidden inside an illustration. The key to solving them lies in manipulating the objects within the illustrations to progress the plot and reveal the truth about the characters--relying not just on the player’s intelligence, but on their imagination and sensitivity to the illustrations and the story.\n\n「Classical Artworks Turned into Nightmares」\n\nClassical paintings such as the Mona Lisa and Dance form the basis for multiple levels within the game, turning classical works of art into surreal and nightmarish scenarios with which the player can interact."

Take the role of gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd, and come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack reach his retirement with a nice stack of bills, or will he end up broken ... or worse? \n\nManage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage. \n\nChoose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you’ll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg’s crime bosses. Sometimes you’ll find yourself dodging questions in the press room, or even the occasional cross-examination in the witness box. Can you keep this pressure cooker from exploding, at least for long enough to stash away a nice retirement nest egg?\n\n- Your mission is clear: make $500,000 in 180 days before Jack Boyd reaches retirement. How? That’s up to you!\n\n- Decisions, decisions! This Is the Police is all about a dark story and how you react to it. Whatever you decide, your choices will influence the game – and the fate of Jack Boyd.\n\n- The Good, the Bad, and... the Ugly? The Chief of Freeburg's Police Department deals with all kind of people. It is up to you to find the bad guys and decide how to deal with them.\n\n- Carry out your duties. As head of Freeburg PD, Jack deals with all sorts of challenges every day: responding to emergencies, managing his officers, defending the department against City Hall and a corrupt mayor, and much more.\n\n- Solve Investigations and gather evidence against the criminal gangs of Freeburg.\n\n- Deal with the competing powers of the city. Everyone offers you favors, and each one comes at a price.\nRich and fully voiced story: Jack Boyd is portrayed by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem."

It has other, more important features as well.\n\n*Collect chickens and produce energy using a special, non-violent method to upgrade the city and unlock abilities. The city gives you NPC assistants and squad members, and abilities let Vladimir take down opponents in increasingly showy ways, like summoning a pink worm to slow your enemies then using a giant wrench to deal a devastating blow.\n\n*Each stage you complete earns you VladCoins, which you can spend to upgrade Vladimir's skills and abilities, making him stronger.\n\n*Gigantic chickens with crates will grant you new abilities - the faster you catch up to them by raising the city up the endless well the action happens in, the more you get.\n\n*You can summon the Horsemen of the Apocalypse to help you in battle once the Magnet is fully charged, and they also grant you the Horsemen's Gifts, which are special boss-related bonuses.\n\nDRAW CHILLY is sponsored by our rich imagination.

Get 40% off the original game and 33% off the extra story \"Blissful Sleep\"!\n\nWelcome to a grim dystopian future.\n\nA totalitarian State controls every aspect of private and public life. Laws are oppressive. Surveillance is total. Privacy is dead. You are the State-installed manager of an apartment building. Your daily routine involves making the building a sweet spot for tenants, who will come and go.\n \nHowever, that is simply a facade that hides your real mission.\n \nThe State has appointed you to SPY ON YOUR TENANTS! Your primary task is to covertly watch your tenants and eavesdrop on their conversations.

You must also REPORT anyone capable of violating the laws or plotting subversive activities against the State to the authorities.\n \nBeholder is all about making choices - choices that matter!\nWhat will you do with the information you collect? Will you report the suspicious activities of a father and orphan his children? Or will you withhold the details about his illegal activities and give him a chance to make things right?

If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\r\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\r\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\r\n\r\nWe will update and improve Real Drift constantly. Please rate and give your feedback for further improvement of the game.\r\nFOLLOW US\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Real-Drift/788082697884714"

      "label": "\"If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you.\" - , 9/10, Pocket Gamer UK\n\n\"This War of Mine isn’t exactly “fun,” but it’s definitely a game worth playing.\" , 9/10, 148apps\n\n\"I'm really excited to go home and download 11 bit studios' title on my iPad\" , Game Informer\n\nIn This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n\nThis War of Mine: Anniversary Edition\nIt's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? \n\nKey Features:\n• Inspired by real-life events \n• Control your survivors and manage your shelter \n• Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive \n• Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience \n• Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game \n• Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\n\nThis War of Mine experience is now broadened with \"The Little Ones\" expansion. \"The Little Ones\" explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.\n\n• Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine\n• Protect innocent children\n• Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need\n• Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is optimized for latest devices. While playing on older devices such as iPhone 4s or iPad 2 you might experience lower frame rates."

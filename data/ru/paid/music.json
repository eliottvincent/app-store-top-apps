It is however possible to edit a single-track tablature with the NotePad tool and export your work into .gpx and .gp formats to finish your composition in Guitar Pro 6 or 7. Editing a drum track is not available with the NotePad tool."

(full review on NoTreble.com)\n\nLincoln Goines (electric and acoustic bassist) writes: “This app is an engaging and informative way to check out the original funk. A great tool for musicians, dancers, and all lovers of rhythm”.\n\nPercussive Arts Society: “The interactive application is very thorough [...]. Navigation is simple and the layout is logical and easy to grasp.” \n\nPercussionTutor will allow you to approach South American, Caribbean and West African music in a different way. This app offers you more than a simple play-along. It includes standard notation, videos and specific claves.

You will sound more natural and more alive and you will awaken to new rhythmic possibilities. It's also a great tool for other musicians, dancers and performers who want to immerse themselves into centuries-old traditional languages.\n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Over 80 rhythms (some rhythms include a basic and a more advanced version)\n- Rhythms from Cuba, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Peru, West Africa, ...   \n- ALL drums can be turned on and off individually\n- audio time-stretching feature\n- 59 videos\n- over 50 percussion instruments\n- Sheets of all the rhythms included in the app and in the free book\n- A description of all the rhythms\n- MORE RHYTMS COMING: we are working on a lot more content to be released on a regular basis!\n\n\nFEATURED MUSICIANS: \n\n* Louis Bauzo, performed with Tito Puente, Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Simon \n* Greg Askew, performed with Tito Puente\n* Luiz Ebert\n* Jérôme Goldschmidt, performed with Tito Puente, M.

      "label": "The goal of Relative Pitch ear training is to learn to follow the flow of music, *effortlessly* by ear. The Ear Training University (ETU) app was carefully designed to take all the guess work out of how to learn this skill. Whether you’re a complete beginner in ear training or have done ear training before, ETU’s approach is sure to find any weaknesses your ears may have and systematically build your sense of Relative Pitch from the ground up.\n\nRather than presenting a “Grab Bag” of drills, we have designed a series of lessons that teach you how to do ear training the right way. These lessons include both video instruction and interactive drills.  Most of the settings --including tempo changes-- are already programmed into the drills to keep things interesting and challenging. All you need to do is follow along! \n\nProgress is easy to visualize simply by viewing the Lesson Cards which keep track of your stats, for example: when you started a lesson, the percentage completed, when you last visited a lesson and when you completed it. You can enter your music teacher’s email address and they will receive progress reports every time you complete an activity as well!\n\nThe videos explain how to properly do the drills which include listening drills, singing drills and spelling drills. They will encourage you along the way! \n\nThe best way to learn Relative Pitch is to do both singing drills and listening drills. Singing is active learning. Listening is passive. Learn first by singing and then test your knowledge by listening. ETU’s interactive drills make learning Relative Pitch with this method easy and doable for everyone! \n\n(We realize that watching videos is not for everyone. However, if you only watch one video, watch “The Discernment Drill – The Key to Discerning Harmonic Relationships!” This video discusses one type of interactive drill called \"The Discernment Drill.\" This drill really opens up the ear so that it can perceive harmonic intervals and chords *instantly* even when played lightning-fast during Speed Rounds.)\n\nFeatures:\n⁃\tInterval training drills (up, down, harmonic), both Singing and Listening Drills.\n-      Professionally recorded voice-over cues for drills.\n-      Interval and Chord Spelling drills.\n⁃\tChord Identification drills (arpeggios and harmonic)\n⁃\tChord Inversion drills (harmonic and arpeggiated)\n⁃\tGive your responses with on-screen piano keyboard or large easy to push buttons.\n⁃\tChange instruments at any time during drills\n⁃\tInterval singing and chord singing drills\n⁃\tSetup your correct vocal range\n⁃\tSlow self-paced drills and “Speed Rounds” which test whether you’re ready to move on!\n⁃\tVideo instruction\n⁃\tTeacher Reports (these reports even include spelling test questions and the student’s responses)\n\nPlease check in with us frequently as we have a lot of new content planned for ETU. We’re excited to bring you this app and will be updating frequently!"

A GPU-powered, fast and advanced integrated editor is part of TouchOSC on all platforms - create the most complex of control layouts with ease and precision.\n\nMIDI, OSC and more...\n\nTouchOSC supports sending and receiving any number of MIDI and OSC messages on many connections simultaneously. On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

      "label": "You wish you could play any video file on your iPhone/iPad, no matter its format?  that's why we made GPlayer.\n\n@ZDNET: GPlayer fills the iOS void left by VLC!\n\n* Follow our Twitter @GinkgoTech to get the free code when new version released.\n \n* GPlayer was honored as \"app of the Week\" in the Appcast.\n\n* Supported File Format Extension \n\n- AVI(without packet-b frame), WMV, RMVB, ASF, H264, MKV, TS, M2TS... most of all movie file formats.\n- MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG, FLAC... most of all audio file formats.\n- SMI, ASS, SUB, SRT, TXT... most of all subtitle file formats. [build in subtitle is also supported]\n\n* Extra Features\n\n- USB Sync: Use itunes to fast sync movies to GPlayer.\n- WIFI Upload: Upload movie even you don't have the cable.\n- File Management: Support New/Rename/Cut/Paste/Delete.\n- Movie Thumbnail: Easy to find the movie you want to view.\n- Different Play Mode: Support Loop off/Loop One/Loop all.\n- Screen Lock: View your movie even on the bed.\n- Dynamically Menu: Dynamically choose audio/subtitle channel and encoding method.\n- Gesture support: Easier way to do seek while playing the movie.\n- Resume Function: Don't worry about closing your application suddenly.\n- TV Out: Both cable TV out and AirPlay are supported.\n- iTunes Backup: By default, we will not backup media data when you do iTunes sync or iCloud backup, and you can't see the files in iTunes, you can enable it in the settings page to backup your media data.\n\n* FAQ\n\n- How do I put files into GPlayer? \nTo add files to your GPlayer app, you have to go to iTunes, and select the “Apps” tab. At the bottom of this page, there’s a “File sharing” section – just select GPlayer in the list, and add files from there. Note that you don’t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the “File sharing” tab, and they’ll be uploaded immediately. You can even use a friend’s iTunes to add videos to your own iPhone. Also, adding files over WiFi is supported. Indeed, WiFi is significantly slower than USB, and ruins the battery life.\n\n- What kind of streams does GPlayer play? \nGPlayer is able to play RTSP and MMS streams. For now those can’t be added to the media library, but you can click an RTSP or MMS url in Safari or Mail for example.\nIf you want to use GPlayer to open HTTP/FTP streaming, add \"gplayer:\" prefix in the URL.\n\n- I want to explicitely open an attachment with GPlayer? \nIf you want to watch an attachment in GPlayer(from Mail for example), just do a long press on the attachment. A menu will pop-up that will let you pick GPlayer as a player.\n\n- iTunes won’t let me install GPlayer on my iPhone or iPod Touch? \nUnfortunately, we had to drop support for older iOS devices such as the iPhone 3G or the first two versions of iPods. Indeed, after some testing, we realized those weren’t fast enough to provide a pleasant experience.\n\n- Why HD MKV movies don’t play smoothly? \nCurrently, only iPad 2 supports 720p MKV file, that’s to be expected. The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n- The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable \"Skip Frame\" in the settings page.\n\n- Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, supports iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.\n\n* Contact us\n\nMail: gplayersupport@hotmail.com\nWebsite: gplayersupport.wordpress.com\n\n* If you want to help to translate GPlayer to your mother language, just drop a mail to gplayersupport@hotmail.com, that will help people in your country enjoy this software, and we will put your name in thanks page!"

It is jam-packed with tools to help you create music with the convenience of your touch screen and each section works the way you work. With SynthStation, you can create and save sequences and complete songs. The app contains three different three-oscillator synths and a range of drum kits you can sequence and mix right in the SynthStation. For creating melodic and accompaniment parts, the SynthStation contains an arpeggiator with preset patterns, built-in effects and filters, and an XY touch control interface for expressive control of key parameters.\n\nPERFORM\nPlay with keys, XY and arpeggiator controls. This is perfect place to make magic happen because it gives you access to all the common controls you’ll need in a performance or creation setting.\n\nSYNTH\nComplete synthesis controls from oscillators to LFOs, envelopes, and more. You can control a wide range of filters to dial in exactly the sound you need. Choose from Sine, Triangle, Square or Sawtooth on your VCO and start creating your own signature sounds from scratch. Filter Cutoff and Resonance are just two taps away.\n\nDRUMS\nIn addition to SynthStation's three synthesizers, we've included drum kits and a visual representation of the most iconic beat making tool in the world - MPC pads.

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever.

It can even stream to a PC running Windows Media Player.\n\nIf you've heard all the hype about AirPlay and are missing out because you don't have an AppleTV, this app is for you!\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ HOW TO USE ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n√ Connect your iPod, iPhone or iPad to the same local network as your Xbox, PS3, PS4 or PC.\n\n√ Start AirMusic.\n\n√ For Xbox 360, navigate to the Xbox System Music Player and select your device from the list.\n\n√ For Xbox One, navigate to the Xbox One Media Player under Apps and select your device in the list.\n\n√ For PS3, navigate to the PS3 Music Menu and select your device in the list. If it shows nothing underneath, it probably means you selected the Movie or Photo menu instead.\n\n√ For PS4, locate the Media Player in the Store.\n\n√ When AirMusic detects a Chromecast device, an icon will appear in the AirMusic navigation bar. Tap on it to connect then select the music you want to stream.\n\n√ For a PC running Windows, start Windows Media Player, your iPhone Music will show under 'Other Libraries'.\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ IMPORTANT ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with Apple Music.\n\n• AirMusic is compatible with iCloud as long as songs have been downloaded onto your phone. Tap the little cloud download icon next to each song or album in the Music app to download them.\n\n• If AirMusic is not detecting all songs, try toggling Sync Library under iOS Settings > Music.\n\n• AirMusic requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with a minimum of 50MB of disk space to work effectively. \n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with old DRM songs purchased on iTunes.

You will learn to recognize keys based on the number of sharps or flats in a key signature at the beginning of a staff.\nChoose from three learning modes using the buttons at the top of the module home screen:\n• Learn key signatures for major keys only – left button\n• Learn key signatures for minor keys only – middle button\n• Learn key signatures for both major and minor keys – right button\n\nNotes module: Learn music notes – this module will teach you to quickly recognize notes without thinking – you’ll look at it, and you’ll simply know it.\nChoose from three learning modes using the buttons at the top of the module home screen:\n• Learn notes from the treble clef only – left button\n• Learn notes from the bass clef only – middle button\n• Learn notes from both treble and bass clef – right button\n\nIntervals module: Learn intervals – this module is especially helpful for pianists. Skilled pianists don't need to identify every note in a sheet. They recognize patterns based on the distance between notes (intervals) and automatically stretch their fingers accordingly.\nChoose from three learning modes using the buttons at the top of the module home screen:\n• Learn harmonic intervals only – left button\n• Learn melodic intervals only – middle button\n• Learn both harmonic and melodic intervals – right button"

It's an incredible tool for all audio engineers and musicians ... My mixing has improved by leaps and bounds after just a few weeks with Quiztones.”\n\n- Austin McAllister\n\n\nA professional Audio Engineer of 10 years, I've come across many ear training devices, blind tests, and software. This app is TOPS! Highly recommended! The developers are serious about what they do. You will not be disappointed!\n\n- Joel Avery\n\n——\n\nWhy We Created Quiztones EQ Ear Training Apps ...\n\nWe thought there should be an easier way to learn how to use EQ, train your ears and expedite the path to getting professional quality mixes, recordings and productions.\n\nWhen I was at music school ten years ago studying audio engineering and music production, my teacher turned an iMac around, pulled up an EQ in Pro Tools and started quizzing the class on which audio frequencies he was boosting or cutting in a mix. That's when it hit me — this should be an app, with various difficulty levels, a scoring system and the ability to import your own source material for quizzes that will teach you how to use EQ like a pro.\n\nFast forward to today — 50k app downloads later — and we're still just as excited to keep evolving Quiztones to help you take the quality of your mixes, recordings and productions to the next level."

      "label": "Been saving up for that Hang, but don't have quite enough yet? You can get busy on our version of the infamous steel instrument. Start it up, bang away, even record your own loop to play along with.  So authentic, your friends will think yours has already arrived. Fill them in on the secret, and they too can download and record their own creations.  Do I hear a \"Hang out\"???\n\nFeatures include:\n* Audiobus 2 support including state saving\n* 45 tunings including microtonal tunings \n* Sounds sampled from actual instrument\n* Loop recording and playback\n\nLittle bit of information about the Hang ... The Hang is a steel percussion instrument that is typically played using the hands and fingers while it rests in the musician's lap.  It was developed in Switzerland in 2000 by  Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer.  There are currently 5 generation models.\n\nOurs is a first generation Hang that defaults to the Aeolian tuning with a D3 central note and a A3 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 A4 tone loop. The eight notes are arranged in a 'Tone Circle' that zig-zag from low to high and are harmonically tuned around the low 'Ding' note in the center.  Select from 45 tunings including microtonal tunings.  These various tunings can be mixed into loops that are being constructed.\n\nMany thanks and kudos to Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer for creating such a unique, elegant, and fun instrument.  For more information about the origin of the Hang, to hear some sound samples, or just to see someone kickin' it, visit one of the following:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(instrument)\nhttp://www.hangdrum.info\n\nThe loop recording in all of the OddTunes apps is roughly modelled after the Gibson / Oberheim Echoplex Digital Pro.  While there are only a few buttons, there is much more functionality there than meets the eye. For more information on the operation of the looper, please visit our Web site at the following address:\n\nhttp://www.avacata.com/iphone/oddtunes/hang/\n\nOddTunes:Hang is one of the many fine instruments coming your way from the Avacata iPhone development team.  Stay tuned for new upcoming OddTunes releases and additions to the loop recording capabilities.\n\nFrom one musician to another ... it's Hang time. Ding, Ding, Ding.\n\n========================\n\nComing soon: \n\n- Save your loops.  Share your loops.  Amaze your friends.\n\n- New tuning packs (we've kept track of all of your requests and have a few of our own)\n\n- MIDI support (in and out)\n\n========================\n\nAlso, check out Avacata's game: Bishook.

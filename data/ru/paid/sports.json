You no longer have to look for a balance between the quality of training and the time to prepare it - you will always be ready to give the client the maximum result.\n\nThe application will always be at your fingertips and will completely replace paper notebooks and organizers.\n\nA convenient list of clients will allow you to quickly and conveniently contact your wards, as well as control their registration for training.\n\nThe client questionnaire will never be lost, so you will not forget the goal and the client's existing health problems.\n\nPreparing a workout program now takes just a few seconds - any client's workout can be copied as a template. The application will tell you which exercises should not be performed for health reasons, and the ability to switch between clients will allow you to simultaneously train for several people with the same or different programs. If some exercise is not in the application database, it can be quickly and conveniently added.\n\nThe rethought calendar will allow you to plan and visualize your day, mark weekends and shifts, and inform the client about the next entry in a couple of clicks. An important distinguishing feature of the organizer is the ability to record several people at the same time.\n\nCustomer statistics will be very handy for tracking progress. In addition to measuring the weight and volume of different parts of the body at the discretion of the client, the program will tell you how much the strength indicators have changed since the start of classes.\n\nEven if a client stopped exercising and was deleted from the list of clients, all his data and training statistics can be restored from the archive as needed.\n\nAnd if for some reason you can no longer work with a client, you can transfer it to your colleague. The entire training process and training history can be transferred in just a few seconds.\n\nThank you for using our app!\n\nYou can send all your questions and suggestions to our mail betterlifeinc@mail.ru\n\n\nUser Agreement https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet\n\n• For Mini, Junior, Max, DD2 you can choose which cylinder you are using. At the Grand Finals 2016, the cylinders for the Mini and Junior classes were updated. At the Grand Finals 2017, the cylinders for classes Max and DD2 were updated. New cylinders require richer carburation\n• Two different tuning modes: \"By regulations\" and \"Freestyle\"!\n• In first mode, the following values are given: main jet, spark plug, spark plug gap, needle type and position (including intermediate positions with washer), air screw position, idle screw position, optimal water temp, gear oil recommendation\n• In second mode (Freestyle), the following values are given: main jet, spark plug, emulsion tube, needle, needle type and position (including intermediate positions with washer), throttle valve, idle jet (outer pilot jet), idle emulsifier (inner pilot jet), air screw position\n• Fine tuning for all these values\n• History of all your carburetor setups\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (VP MS93, gasoline with or without ethanol)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Adjustable floats height\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station via Bluetooth: Kestrel DROP & 5x00, WeatherFlow WEATHERmeter, Skywatch BL\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg for pressures\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab two jetting setups are shown ('By regulation' and 'Freestyle'). These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine and track configuration given in the next tabs.\n  Also this tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all values for each carburetor config to adapt to the concrete engine.\n  Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too.\n  You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of A/F (air and fuel) or Lambda\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all jetting setups. If you change the weather, or engine setup, or fine tuning, the new setup will be saved in history\n\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, spark plug manufacturer, float type and height, fuel type, oil mix ratio and type of the track\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external services to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station.\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone\n\n\nFor Rotax Max non-EVO Engine please try our other app: Jetting Rotax Max Kart\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us.

Format sizes: boards in centimeters, kites in square meters.\nNow this is not just a helper in choosing the right size of equipment for specific wind conditions. MapKit framework was added to application for working with maps and the history of your actions is also preserved!\nThe level of training supports two modes: amateur and expert. Expert mode provides a 10% larger kite, as with increasing your level, you will improve control over equipment and you'll need a little bit larger size to jump higher;)\nThe app lets you save all your equipment in the table. In this case, you can immediately see the most suitable set for the present weather conditions.\nTake into consideration that the calculation corresponds to the averaged data. It is impossible to take into account the abilities of each individual rider. You can always take a larger or smaller size of the equipment. It relates to the size of the board because it is very individual, especially when the level of your preparation increases.  This will depend on your style of riding, for example, you can take the bigger board than recommended and thus it will be enough to get smaller kite. In any case, we will respond to your comments and suggestions for improving the program and add new features to it.\n\nIMPORTANT: This application is not intended for beginners because in the training stage it will be better if experienced instructor chooses equipment for you!\n\nThis app may use your location even when it isn’t open, which can decrease device battery life."

In order to individualize a training you first need to make an attempt with the maximum breath holding. To start take 3-4 warm-up attempts (about half the time of your maximum score). Then hold your breath maximally and save the result of your maximum breath holding. On the basis of this maximum breath holding training tables will be automatically calculated (table CO2 and table O2).\n\nThere are 2 basic tables. The table CO2 helps to accustom the brain to the high level of CO2. The table O2 helps to accustom the brain to the lower level of O2.\nThe table CO2 is a series of static breath holdings with the decrease of the rest time at a constant breath holding time.\nThe table O2 is a series of static breath holdings with the increase of breath holding time at a constant rest time.\n\nApnea Tables integrates with the Apple Health app to sync your workouts."

Punch speed on iPhone 4S may be 2 times lower, but duration and reaction time are still correct. App works perfectly on iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone SE. But it may be not that easy to grip iPhone 6 Plus or  iPhone 6S Plus when you punch.\n\nSpeed measurement error is not more than 5% in most cases. Maximum acceleration is about 16g. Power is calculated approximately, with special formula based on your skills level, punch speed, and your mass. Put your mass in a punch to get more accurate result. Distance is calculated with small deviation when you punch the air. You get a straight distance between punch starting point and punch ending point. Time accuracy is limited to 10 ms.\n\nWarning! Use this app only at your own risk! Make sure that you hold your iPhone strong enough and be careful when you punch! Developer disclaims any responsibility."

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

We are leaving the choice to you.\n* Of course, in the future there will be some other fake applications, but do not forget us, we are the first to do this and we will always be best for you.\n \n What is the reason to choose us for you?\n* We are cheaper than others. If you look or search in the internet, you will see that other applications are much more expensive than us.\n* Others show only the matches which they liked. But we are giving all matches to you.\n* Others show only some statistics but we show all statistics to you.\n* Others sends the predictions by email 12-24 hours ago, but you can see all predictions online in our applications.\n\n Which data you will see in our application?\n* League Name\n* Home Team\n* Away Team\n* Home Team Score\n* Away Team Score\n* Home Team Odd\n* Away Team Odd\n* Home Team – Total Matches\n* Away Team – Total Matches\n* Home Team – Home Matches\n* Away Team – Away Matches\n* Total Goal Average, for Over/Under prediction.\n* Prediction for result and percentage of prediction.\n\n If you have any idea, question or need, please feel free to contact with us by using this email address : info@north-software.com \n \n Some additional descriptions:\n\n Some people prefer to bet on some leagues and some others prefer to bet on different leagues. For this reason, even if it reduce our success percentage, we wanted to serve you almost every league. You will decide which league or which team you want to bet on.\n\n For “1” and “2” predictions, we suggest you to use only first leagues. For second and third leagues, it is more common to see that strong teams loose the match or the match ends in draw. We do not restrict those kind of situations in our application because we want to serve you every single match.\n\n For “Over” and “Under” predictions, we suggest you to prepare one table to determine which league is suitable for “Over” or “Under” betting. For example: Greece first league, Greece second league, Portugal second league, Spain second league are not suitable for “Over” predictions. Do not bet on.\n\n We tried to explain how you are going to use this application, we hope that we succeeded. If you are good at logic and mathematics, than you will use this application more effective and successful. You will use this application more effective day by day. You will even create black list for teams and leagues by time pasing.\n\n Good luck !"

You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc.

      "label": "This application shows all today's matches. By using intelligent algorithms, it makes predictions about the results. Those predictions are designed and prepared by European Sports Analyzers and Computer Engineers.\n\nAll today's matches are shown in one screen. Matches are grouped by their leagues. Now, you can easily compare them to each other.\n\nIn this application, you can see the below information.\n* country and league name\n* home team and away team name\n* home team and away team odds\n* home team and away team total point\n* The performance of home team (last 5 matches)\n* The performance of away team (last 5 matches)\n* Match start time (if the match is not over yet)\n* Match result (if the match is over)\n* The prediction (1, 2, 1X or 2X)\n* The percentage (the possibility of the prediction)\n\nWhat are the reasons to choose our application?\n* We are cheaper than others. If you search in the internet, you will see that other applications are more expensive than us.\n* We are showing all matches. Others show only some matches.\n* Others are sending the predictions 12-24 hours before the current day, only by email, but we are providing all predictions online in our application.\n\nIf you have any idea or question, please feel free to contact with us.\ninfo@north-software.com\n\nSome additional descriptions:\n\nSome people prefer to bet on some specific leagues but some other people prefer to bet on different leagues. For this reason, even if it is reducing our success percentage, we wanted to show you almost every league. You can decide which league or which team that you want to bet on.\n\nFor “1” and “2” predictions, we suggest you to use only first leagues. For second and third leagues, it is more common to see that strong teams loose the match or the match ends in draw. We do not want to hide some matches in our application because we want to show you every single match.\n\nWe hope you will like this application.\n\nGood luck!"

But there are products out there, where you can put your iDevice into, to make it waterproof and still be able to operate it. In this way you can either mount it near your other instruments on your keelboat or strap it to your arm if you are sailing a dinghy.\n\nFeatures:\n\nMain View.\nHere you can see your 4 most important readouts, fore instance Heading, Speed, VMG and Performance.\n\nThere also is a lift indicator, showing you if you have been lifted by a wind shift, and graphs showing the development in your speed and VMG over a configurable amount of time and a permormance bar.\n\nWind direction.\nSet your wind direction by storing your heading while sailing on upwind on starboard and port tack, or simply type it in.\n\nStart view.\nHere you have your count down (including sync), and you can mark your starting line and iRegatta will calculate the distance to the line and indicate the favorite line end, if wind direction is set.\n\nStatistics view.\nView your current position and trip odometer and max speed since last reset. You'll also see a polar diagram with your speed and VMG (wind speed dependent).\n\nWaypoints.\nNavigate to your favorite pre-stored waypoints, or create a new temporary waypoint by cross bearing using the iPhone internal camera, or by distance/bearing.\n\nTracking.\nRecord your track and view it on the map or export it for further analysis to your computer.\n\nInstead of internal GPS you can get instrument information over WiFi from NMEA0183 instruments. \n\nAIS data received over WiFi will be displayed in a Radar-like view.\n\niRegatta also comes with a watch app, which will allow you to view data on your watch as well as operate the start line features. Besides that, the watch app will track your sailing as an activity and help you close your activity circles using HealthKit..\n\nRead more detailed information on the apps web page."

It doesn’t require any connection to your car. Results are provided as detailed reports featuring interactive charts.\n\nHow does PerfExpert dyno works ? It's simple :\n1. Create your car profile => Describe your car to PerfExpert by providing information such as curb weight, tire sizes or engine displacement. If you don't know how to find your car's specifications, we help you to do so.\n2. Mount your phone in your car => No need to connect your phone to your car. With your phone firmly mounted inside your car, PerfExpert can rely on its internal sensors to measure the real acceleration of your car.\n3. Accelerate through the entire engine rev range => On a flat, straight and horizontal road, perform an acceleration from low rev to the maximum rev, keeping the same gear : that's it!\n\nIMPORTANT : dyno test is not compatible with automatic gearboxes that doesn't have a manual mode.\n\nWith such a tool, you can check the efficiency of your various tunings, ECU mapping, chiptuning, and even your chassis settings.\n\nUsing the specification of the tested car and your device’s accelerometer, the application runs our algorithms and dynamic power loss calculations to provide the performances of your car with high accuracy.\n\nSkeptical? Here is a selection of comparison tests between “PerfExpert - Car Onboard Dyno” and real chassis dynos, performed by some of our users : http://bit.ly/perfexpert_vs_chassis_dyno\n\nFor further information, you can find our FAQ at https://www.perfexpert-app.com/faq\n\nHere are sample dyno and timed run reports created using the application :\nhttps://network.perfexpert-app.com/results/featured\n\nJoin now the growing PerfExpert community:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PerfExpert\n- Support : https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfexpert/\n\nFeatures:\n- Dyno test : measure the power and torque of your engine with advanced loss calculation model. Detection of the engine rev limiter. Detailed reports featuring interactive charts of wheel and engine horsepower and torque / engine speed, just like a regular chassis dynamometer.\n\n- Compute corrected power and torque using the correction norm of your choice (atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature and air humidity are taken into account). Available standards: DIN (Europe), SAE (America), JIS (Japan), CEE (Europe) and ISO (International).\n\n- Timed Run test to measure your 0-60mph, 0-60ft, 0-1/8mi, 0-1/4mi, 0-100km/h, 0-20m, 0-200m, 0-400m,  and much more.\n\n- Use of your phone accelerometer at its maximum frequency and advanced signal processing for smoothed curves.\n\n- Custom choice of units from a large choice: Hp, Ch, Cv, Kw, Nm, Ft.Lb, mKg, Mph, Km/h, m, ft, G, m/s², psi, inHg, mBar, °C, °F\n\n- Export reports in Tab Separated Value format and PNG"

Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs. Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude and relative horsepower are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tunning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine. We strongly advise you to adjust this value before the race in order to get an optimum performance. This value will be stored and used in the future sessions.\n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about the engine and the track, that is, the engine type (Senior, Junior, Minimax, Micromax, Supermax or DD2), the spark plug brand used, the needle type, the float/pilot jet combo, the float height, airbox type (new model or the old square model), track type (with long, short or medium straights), oil mix ratio and venturi type (12.5 or 8.5).\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures."

Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

Short videos show how to execute the individual steps correctly from several different perspectives - in real time, slow motion and with diagrams. In order to study individual movement sequences in greater detail, it is possible to move the pictures both forwards and backwards individually. \nStill pictures with explanatory texts illustrate the crucial phases of the movement and help users improve their technique so as to ski more efficiently.\nOnce the app has been downloaded, the videos can be played without an Internet connection.

The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest public weather station (from the GPS tab).\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about your engine, carburator and track, that is, the engine type (Micromax, Minimax, Senior, Supermax, Junior or DD2), the model year of the engine, the spark plug brand used, the needle type, the float/pilot jet combo, the floats height, venturi, oil mix ratio, airbox type (new or old model) and the track type.\n- GPS: this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe application works with different measure units: inHg, mb, mmHg, hPa, atm for pressure, ºC and ºF for temperature.\n\nThe app is NOT VALID for Rotax Max engines before 2015. For these engines, you should install Jetting Max Kart."

Even if your are flying accidentally within a cloud or under poor visibility conditions!\n\nBy typing to „Alt 3“ - usually after the adjusting phase - or any time later you can reset „Alt 3“ to „0“.\n\nMoreover you can use the App to\n\n    - record you flights \n    - view your recorded flights in the integrated map view  \n    - send your recorded flights by mail as kml-files or gpx -files to your friends \n    \nOne last note: \nThe app reacts a little somewhat slower, as e.g. a Bräuninger- or Flytec Vario, if you use the internal pressure sensor of the iPhone, because the sensor doesn't provide data as often as an external sensor. \n\nThe app requires a good GPS signal, if no internal or external pressure sensor can be used. \n\nPlease make sure in any case, that you have a good GPS signal,  if you use the app. \nThe app does NOT work - completely and reliably - in buildings or other situations in which you have no or a bad GPS signal! \nHowever, this should not be a problem, since you usually flying under a clear open sky. ;-) \n\nUsage - without - an internal or external sensor is possible, but subject to known the limitations of a pure GPS operation, such as using only open-air, a good GPS signal and altitude changes > 5m with at least 1-2 m/s. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\nEven if the App is running in background, the GPS location service is used by the App, if you record your flight!"

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle type and clip position, pilot jet and air screw position are shown (screw position is expressed in turns from fully tightened). These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration introduced in the next tabs. Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. The air density and density altitude are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine (you know that each engine has its own personality). \n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the model year, model and carburetor, and the oil mix ratio that you\\'re using.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures.\n\nValid for the following models from 2005 to 2021:\n- 50 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 50 SX Factory Edition: 2021.\n- 50 SX Mini: 2017-2021.\n- 65 SX: 2017-2021.\n- 85 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 105 SX: 2006-2012.\n- 125 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 125 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 125 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 125 XC: 2017-2018.\n- 144 SX: 2007-2008.\n- 150 SX: 2009-2021.\n- 150 XC: 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019.\n- 200 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 200 XC: 2005-2012.\n- 250 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 250 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 250 XC: 2007-2019.\n- 250 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 XC: 2009-2018.\n- 300 MXC: 2005.\n* Please note that the application is valid only for engines that use carburetor.

Those predictions and data are designed and prepared by European Sports Analyzers and Computer Engineers.\n* In our applications, you can find the whole leagues’ matches and league table in the same screen and you can easily compare them. \n\n What is the biggest advantages of our application?\n* All data is ready and in one sheet; easy to compare everything. \n* You can compare league by league.\n* You can compare match by match.\n* You can compare according to total match statistics.\n* You can compare according to home/away statistics.\n \n What is our aim?\n* Our aim is not to bilk you by showing you incorrect data.\n* Our aim is not to serve expansive predictions.\n* Our aim is to serve you useful data and the choice up to you. We are leaving the choice to you.\n* Of course, in the future there will be some other fake applications, but do not forget us, we are the first to do this and we will always be best for you.\n \n What is the reason to choose us for you?\n* We are cheaper than others. If you look or search in the internet, you will see that other applications are much more expensive than us.\n* Others show only the matches which they liked. But we are giving all matches to you.\n* Others show only some statistics but we show all statistics to you.\n* Others sends the predictions by email 12-24 hours ago, but you can see all predictions online in our applications.\n\n Which data you will see in our application?\n* League Name\n* Home Team\n* Away Team\n* Home Team Score\n* Away Team Score\n* Home Team Odd\n* Away Team Odd\n* Home Team – Total Matches\n* Away Team – Total Matches\n* Home Team – Home Matches\n* Away Team – Away Matches\n* Total Goal Average, for Over/Under prediction.\n* Prediction for result and percentage of prediction.\n\n If you have any idea, question or need, please feel free to contact with us by using this email address : info@north-software.com \n \n Some additional descriptions:\n\n Some people prefer to bet on some leagues and some others prefer to bet on different leagues. For this reason, even if it reduce our success percentage, we wanted to serve you almost every league. You will decide which league or which team you want to bet on.\n\n For “1” and “2” predictions, we suggest you to use only first leagues. For second and third leagues, it is more common to see that strong teams loose the match or the match ends in draw. We do not restrict those kind of situations in our application because we want to serve you every single match.\n\n For “Over” and “Under” predictions, we suggest you to prepare one table to determine which league is suitable for “Over” or “Under” betting. For example: Greece first league, Greece second league, Portugal second league, Spain second league are not suitable for “Over” predictions. Do not bet on.\n\n We tried to explain how you are going to use this application, we hope that we succeeded. If you are good at logic and mathematics, than you will use this application more effective and successful. You will use this application more effective day by day. You will even create black list for teams and leagues by time pasing.\n\n Good luck !"

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

      "label": "Shooter is an external ballistics calculator designed to bring you  highly accurate solutions quickly. Shooter accomplishes this by saving your firearm and ammo data and makes it easily selectable upon loading the app as well as providing features like Kestrel and WeatherFlow integration to import your atmospherics via Bluetooth. Shooter has successfully aided hunters, marksmen and sniper teams for years.\n\nSome key features:\n\n* An extremely accurate, fast and proven ballistics solver created by Berger Bullet's chief ballistician and champion shooter Bryan Litz\n\n* Save firearm and ammo data as profiles so you don't have to continually entering the same constant data over and over each time you want a calculation\n\n* You probably have several firearms and loads.  It's tedious entering all this data on a handheld device.  With Shooter, you can login to a web interface using your PC at http://manage.shooterapp.net and enter/manage all your firearm/ammo data then simply sync it to your device.\n\n* Finger-controlled graphical wind dial for easy wind angle input\n\n* Online profile backup included at no extra charge\n\n* Built-in large bullet library to make it simpler to add your ammo profiles.  Shooter now supports syncing bullet data from the cloud in order to provide quicker updates for newly released bullets\n\n* Supports Coriolis Effect and Spin Drift calculations; Can get your Latitude and Azimuth for Coriolis Effect using GPS and compass.\n\n* Automatic-atmosphere input using your GPS location and nearest weather station\n\n* Zero-atmosphere support.  This will auto-account for changes to your zero when shooting in a different atmosphere\n\n* Solution screen which allows for extremely quick and easy changing of shot distance, wind or lead speed\n\n* Load atmospherics from Kestrel 5000-series, Kestrel DROP 1/2/3 or WeatherFlow WeatherMeter\n\n* Graph bullet path, drift and velocity with ability to compare up to 6 loads at once\n\n* Velocity Calibration tool which helps you determine your muzzle velocity.\n\n* Email trajectory table output\n\n* Full metric support\n\n\nFor more information and operation manual, please visit http://www.shooterapp.net/manual.php"

It includes a speed/cadence calculator, and can calculate the next gear up or down using only the gears in your track bag.\n\nWant a bigger gear or a smaller gear? Track Gear Calculator works in reverse, too: just swipe the gear inches, and you'll get a new gear, up or down from where you are, using only the chainrings and cogs you have with you. You can also select from the standard 27\" nominal method for calculating gears, or more accurate actual wheel diameters, and you can see results in either Imperial gear inches or Metric development."

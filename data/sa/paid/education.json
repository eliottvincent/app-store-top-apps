      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Educational App Review (iear.org): \"This app is fantastic!!\" \n\nThe Long Division app can be used to teach and study the long division method. Solving long division problems is also excellent subtraction and times tables practice. The app is easy to use and it has an intuitive interface with customizable colors and other settings. The user can solve custom and random division problems with small and large numbers.\n\nEducational App Review (iear.org): Purpose, program functionality and overall educational value are all rated A. \n\nEndorsed by Teachers\n\nR. Zeni, Ecole Sandy Hill Elementary, Abbotsford, BC, Canada:\n\n\"The Math apps by Esa Helttula allow students to practice and reinforce the specific computation strategies taught in class, with as much or as little scaffolding as necessary. I am so glad to have come across this great educational tool!\"\n\nWired.com:\n\n\"The Long Division app is very clear and very useful.\" \n\nEducation Apps Review, www.iear.org:\n\n\"This app is fantastic!! My third graders loved learning with this app! It has infinite enriching and differentiating possibilities, as the students can select easier or more challenging types of problems.\"\n\nPragmaticMom, www.pragmaticmom.com:\n\n\"My 5th Grader is learning long division and sometimes working through the problems step by step is confusing to her. So you can imagine how excited I AM with this app, named Long Division, that translates long division into a color coordinated step by step process and has a number key pad so that the student can input their numbers every step of the way. Then, the numbers slide from the problem, into their proper place in the problem. Very visual and memorable!\"\n\nAppReviewLive, www.appreviewlive.com:\n\n\"It’s almost like having a teacher in the palm of your hand..\"\n\nThe Long Division Method\n\nIn arithmetic, long division is the standard procedure suitable for dividing numbers. The method breaks down a division problem into a series of easier steps.\n\nEasy to Use\n\nThe app allows the user to solve a long division problem step by step and animates all the steps. In the steps the user will divide, multiply or subtract. The correct answer will fly to the right place. If the user presses the wrong button the answer will appear above the keyboard but it will not move. \n\nFeatures:\n\n- The dividend can have 1 - 5 digits\n- The divisor can have 1 - 3 digits\n- Remainders can be allowed or disallowed\n- The dividend and divisor can have decimals and the decimals can have leading zeroes\n- The app will place zeros in order to extend the division to the next decimal place, if needed\n- The divisor can be bigger than the dividend\n- The current operation for each step can be hidden\n- The operands for the current operation can be highlighted\n- The speed of the animations can be set\n- Numbers to divide can be generated randomly or entered manually\n\nOther iDevBooks math apps \n\niDevBooks math apps have been reviewed and endorsed by Wired.com, IEAR.org, Edudemic.com, Teachers with Apps, and other respected sites and organizations.\n\nSome of the other 40 iDevBooks math apps are Column Addition, Column Subtraction, Long Multiplication, Lattice Multiplication, Visual Multiplication Table, Fraction Math, Partial Differences Subtraction, Partial Quotients Division, Partial Sums Addition, Decimal Rounding, etc. \n\nFeedback and requests for new features \n\nNew ideas to make this app better are welcome. Please visit idevbooks.com to give feedback.\n\nPrivacy\n\nThis app has no ads or in-app purchases and it does not transmit any data during the operation of the app. This app also does not contain any links to other apps or the web."

      "label": "« GraphoGame: apprendre à lire » est un logiciel d’entraînement au décodage qui aide les enfants d'âge préscolaire et primaire et les enfants en difficultés à renforcer leurs premières compétences en lecture. Ce jeu aide l’enfant à apprendre les sons des lettres et des groupes de lettres en présentant simultanément les sons (ou mots) correspondant et les groupes de lettres. \n \r\n\r\nFONCTIONNALITÉS:\n \n\r\n\r\n• PAS DE PUBLICITÉ OU D'ACHATS IN-APP.\n\n\r\n• Pour les enfants de 4 à 9 ans.\n\n\r\n• Jouez sans internet.\n\n\r\n• Rapports d'avancement intégrés à l'application.\n\n\r\n• Les niveaux s'adaptent à l'habileté du joueur.\n\n\r\n• Gagnez des récompenses après chaque niveau et utilisez-les pour personnaliser votre avatar !\n\n\r\n• Deux modes de jeu: Étoiles (pour l'école) et Carte (pour la maison).\n\n\r\n• Conforme au RGPD et COPPA, et nous ne collectons ni ne traitons de données personnelles.\n\n\r\n• Contenu complet, pour toujours.  Ne payez jamais plus pour nos mises à jour avec de nouveaux contenus et fonctionnalités !\n\n\r\n\r\nLa progression du jeu est basée sur des données scientifiques : le logiciel a été développé par des linguistes, des neuropsychologues et des orthophonistes pour aider les enfants - en particulier les lecteurs en difficulté - à renforcer les automatismes fondamentaux de la lecture.\n \n\r\n\r\n« GraphoGame: apprendre à lire » accompagne l’enfant à travers différents jeux avec son propre personnage qu’il fait évoluer au cours du jeu. Le joueur passe progressivement aux syllabes, aux rimes, aux mots courts et aux phrases et apprend peu à peu à décoder des mots plus longs. En jouant 15 minutes quotidiennement, l'enfant améliorera sa précision dans le décodage des lettres, des mots, et sa vitesse de lecture.\n\n\r\n\r\nLa plateforme GraphoGame est développée par une communauté de chercheurs et de développeurs de jeux leader en Finlande, tandis que le contenu francophone de « GraphoGame: apprendre à lire » a été développé par le Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive (CNRS) de l'Université d'Aix-Marseille.\n\n\r\n\r\nPour plus d’informations sur le contenu francophone, n’hésitez pas à vous rendre sur le site http://grapholearn.fr"

The same magical augmented reality colouring experience, but with a focus on educational content and a one time purchase for a lifetime of content!\n\nDesigned with educators in mind, Quiver Education has a greater focus on educational content than the standard Quiver App, with specific pages designed around topics as diverse as biology, geometry, and the planets. The team at Quiver is committed to providing regular content updates to the Quiver Education App, and we’d like to hear from you what pages you’d like to see! You can contact us on info@quivervision.com .\n\nInstead of in-app purchases, Quiver Education has a one time purchase price, and is compatible with the volume purchasing program and educational discounts for schools too! We’ve packed the app with a range of top coloring pages already, and new educational content will become available regularly and free of further charge through app updates.\n\n----------- \n\nColoring pages have never been so much fun!  The Quiver Education App combines physical coloring from “back in the day” with state of the art augmented reality technology to bring students an extraordinarily magical and educational experience.  \n\nYou can find our free pages in the app and on our website (http://www.QuiverVision.com/Education).  Save and print the pages directly from the Quiver Education App or from a computer to start enjoying the fun.

Play, observe, ask questions and find the answers. Explore how animals interact with each other, how they live, how they defend themselves and how they reproduce.\n\nLearn and get informed about the pollution of the oceans and its dangers. See how plastics, overfishing, climate change and ships affect the life and health of different ecosystems. We only have one planet — let's take care of it!\n\nWith five incredible ecosystems:\n\nSouth Pole\nDiscover the life of penguins, seals and orcas. Play with them! What do they eat and how do they live? How does climate change affect them?\n\nOctopuses\nFeed the sharks and learn how octopuses defend themselves and not be devoured. Try to protect the divers inside the shark cage!\n\nDolphins\nSee how the dolphins hunt, reproduce and come out to breathe. Play with them until it becomes night so they can go to sleep. Watch the fishing nets — if the dolphins get caught in them, they will not be able to come out to breathe.\n\nTurtles\nFeed the turtles and watch them lay eggs. Help the younglings to get out of the egg, and make sure the turtles don't eat the plastic bags, as they sometime mistake them for jellyfish. Look at the remoras — they always hitch a ride on the turtles.\n\nSeahorses\nSeahorses are small and fragile. Protect them from their predators, crabs, and make the algae and corals grow so they can hide.\n\nFeatures\n\n• Discover how animals live and how they interact in different ecosystems.\n• Play and learn with different marine animals: octopuses, crabs, sharks, turtles, jellyfish, seahorses, penguins, orcas, seals, remoras, starfish...

      "label": "iCircuit 3D gives you an endless virtual workbench upon which to design and test your electronics projects. It combines the robust electronics simulation engine of the original iCircuit with the latest rendering and 3D physics technology of iOS.\n\nDon’t let the physical availability of parts be a constraint on your creativity! Choose from an expansive library of more than 150 physically and electronically simulated parts and over 1,000 reference boards to build and test your circuits for flaws, simulate your physical designs, and test your Arduino code in a fun sandbox environment. Each of these parts is adoringly rendered to look like the real thing so that you can enjoy the beauty of electronics.\n\nWhen powered, LEDs light up realistically, DC motors spin, and speakers make noise! Follow the flow of current along your simulated wires, and see pinout and color code data on the circuit components themselves. Tapping a part gives you quick access to simulated values such as voltage and current and also allows you to change the parameters of the part. In the event of a wiring issue or an over-stressed element, magic smoke will billow from the point of failure, making it easy to locate, diagnose, and fix errors. Add photographs and other reference images to the environment to keep them close at hand. You can even import your own 3D models to attach your electronics to, or use Blocks to build an enclosure, or a panel for them!\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Tons of resistors, capacitors, and LEDs\n* Multiple breadboard and wiring elements\n* Diodes, Transistors, and MOSFETs\n* DC power supplies\n* Waveform Generators to make AC, Square, and Sawtooth signals\n* Various batteries, including AA, AAA, 18650, and coin\n* Switches, including SPST and SPDT\n* Buzzers and speakers\n* DC motors and Servos\n* Programmable Arduino elements!\n* The full symbolic original iCircuit library\n* Over 1,000 reference circuit boards. These are not fully simulated, but are great for layout out your designs.\n* Import custom circuit elements in Eagle Board or Fritzing element formats (imported circuits won’t simulate, but you can at least wire them up)\n* Import custom 3D models to attach your projects to, and simulate their behavior on the workbench\n* Import images for reference or documentation, and they’ll appear as physical photographs\n\nAll of these are available in the 3D work environment that mimics an electronics workbench. When you add parts, they land on the table due to gravity. From there you can drag them around and connect them to each other by drawing wires between their ports. When a circuit is completed, they start simulating. Once connected to each other, wires stay connected no matter where the part is positioned. You can stick them to other parts to make panels and structures, or just leave them laying on the bench haphazardly, like I do. \n\niCircuit 3D was designed with a strong emphasis on fun and exploration and there are a lot more features along those lines to discover!\n\nI hope you enjoy this new take on circuit software."

      "label": "Spoken English - Software Aided\nEnglish is one of the beautiful languages and has an important place in the spheres of universal communication.\nThis language can be learned to read and write as part of formal education in schools. To speak this language needs a good amount of practice which usually is missing in the learning curriculums.\nAs part of learning spoken English, one needs to have a good collection of vocabulary words that help in an easy description of the situation with the flow of words. Not to mention the knowledge of grammar which is mostly learned during schooling days.\nThe methodology is elaborative and is mostly known to the learners, the area which is lacking is the speech practice which people shy in the fear of making mistakes and generally avoid seeing lowly in the eyes of others.\nMaking mistakes and speaking an incorrect language is associated with the societal status in these days to which people prefer not to use this language publicly. This further harms the learning process.\nKeeping this hurdle of public shyness, we have developed the Mobile app which can be run on mobile iPhones and in the iPads.\nThere are three sections in the app. One is dedicated to word meanings, the second one, is spelling learning and the third one is to practice Spoken English with the help of technology.\nWhile the other two sections are self-explanatory, the third one for spoken English is based on the following methodology:\n1.\tShort descriptions in terms of 5 or 10 lines are given. The learner shall memorize these lines and then practice these lines with the interface of the mobile screen line by line.\n2.\tThe line needs to be spoken verbatim that is it should be 100 % matching with what has been read.\n3.\tThere is a hints option given to provide an outline of the sentence. This will form the habit in real-life cases also where the learner needs to form an outline in his mind with the important words and the sequence of the situation.\n4.\tOnce the correct sentence is spoken, the bar will become green and jump to the next line,\n5.\tIf a sentence is spoken incorrectly, the bar will become red and will give the option to try again with the record button.\n\nSo Guys lets get started and I do not want to come in between your exhilarating experience of learning to achieve excellence in your endeavor.\n\nDownload This App Now!"

Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

The Scratch name and Scratch cat are trademarks of MIT.\n\n***NOW A TOP TEN EDUCATIONAL APP IN 50 COUNTRIES****\n\n***Ranked #1 educational app in 14 countries***\n\n\"Tutorials for Scratch\" brings you a whole bunch of video tutorials to get you going making your own games in the new version of Scratch 2.0. This are not the sort of standard tutorials that you find on the web. During the videos you will be set tasks to do in scratch and hopefully you will be able to complete them on your own. However don't worry the next video in each project will show you how to complete the task!!\n\nThese videos are really targeted at primary/elementary students although the content will go on to stretch and challenge even the most able of them with variables, cloning, broadcasting and many other features of Scratch. \n\nThere's even a quiz in the app so you can test your scratch knowledge too!!\n\nScratch really is a fantastic way into learning programming and coding and this app hopefully will be a great asset to get you going with it.\n\nThis is a big app of just under 300Mb, because there is so much material in it. You will need to be hooked into your WiFi connection!!  \n\n*TEACHERS* the point of this app is that kids can use the iPad alongside the pc to build their games in Scratch. You can just sit back and relax without having to plan anything. Oh and there is enough material to keep your students busy for around 6 hours, even if they don't manage to have a go at the extension tasks that are identified for all 4 games!!"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

In addition, although we are currently working on improving the accessibility of our sims, most of the sims included in this app do not include keyboard navigation or screen reader access. As accessible sims become available, they will be updated within the app.\n\nProceeds from the app support the development of more HTML5 sims. On behalf of the PhET team and the students whose lives you have helped improve — Thank you!"

      "label": "⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆ School teacher and mother LOVES this! This app is great! I create a list with all of my students' names to randomly call on someone. At home, I created a list of all the songs that my son needs to practice on the piano. Both my kids and students love it! Also, this app is SUPER user and kid friendly! ⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆ (Customer review) \n\nWhenever you need to choose a random name… or number… or word… Random Name Picker is the fun way to do it! Teachers – choose a random student for questions, privileges, anything – better than drawing straws. Office teams can choose a random team member for the month. Parents can choose a random chore for the week. \n\nRandom Name Picker remembers where you left off each time and allows you to continue where you left off, choosing a new random name each session from those who have not yet been selected. Or if you want to start from scratch and throw everyone into the mix you can do so.\n\nRandom Name Picker has 36 fun game themes including Pinball, Music, Golf, Cookies, Ping Pong, Sushi, Billiards, Pancakes, Bowling, Bubbles, Popcorn, Donuts, Monsters, Balloons, Fish, Bugs, Crabs, Rockets, Robots, Gumballs, Sports, the Beach and more! There are also nine seasonal themes: Apples, Pumpkins, Fall Leaves, Snowflakes, Snowmen, Hearts, Shamrocks, Rain and Flowers.\n\nPlayers can watch in suspense as their name stays in the running – or is eliminated – until the final random name is left. Choosing the random name is part of the fun – a great attention-getting device. And you can adjust the speed so that your random name is selected very quickly… or you can draw out the suspense and fun by slowing it down. \n\nYou can also use Random Name Picker to choose a random answer or review term for students to identify: how about creating a list with the numbers \"9\" \"12\" \"18\" \"21\" \"24\" – and asking students to identify factors for the chosen number? Or how about creating a list with \"triangle\" \"square\" \"rectangle\" \"rhombus\" \"pentagon\" \"parallelogram\" – and asking students to identify a property of the selected polygon? \n\nExample: \"Who can answer this question about our reading text? I'm going to call on this student… (sports balls with class names on them are kicked away until only the name \"Ethan\" is left) …Ethan!\"\n\nExample: \"I want you to think of two factors for the number 12. Now I'm going to call on… (balloons with class names pop one at a time until only the name \"Madison\" is left) …Madison!\"\n\nExample: \"If this student is sitting nicely, he/she will be my helper… It's… (fish with class names are caught one at a time until only the name \"Aidan\" is left) …Aidan!\"\n\nExample: \"Look at the words that are on the screen and think about which ones are nouns and which are verbs… Here's the final word… (pop corn kernals, some with nouns and some with verbs, pop one at a time until only the word \"car\" is left) …CAR. Noun or verb? Tell your partner how you know.\"\n\nYou can add as many groups of words or numbers as you want to the Random Name Picker. How about a list of… \nStudents in first period,\nThe Marketing Team,\nStudents on Team 1,\nChores for the week,\nScience review terms,\nState capitals,\nMath facts,\nNouns and verbs,\nFactors and multiples,\nShapes to draw,\nPolygons to identify,\nPresidents,\nReview terms for any subject…\nthe possibilities are endless!"

Whether it's an exam, a book, a film or a movie, or any aspect of life, it allows you to become more familiar with that area more quickly. With accurate real-life examples and precise English word meanings, they make it possible for you to not only know the most commonly used words, but to actually use them better in the real world.\n\n# Smart word recommendations\n\nDon't have a specific goal in mind? Or have a lot of words memorized but still find a lot of unfamiliar words in conversation, reading, or watching videos? \"Smart Recommendations\" allows you to focus on the words used most often but you are most likely to not know, based on your current vocabulary. Memorize the words that work best for you, so that every word you meet outside of Wozi is no longer unfamiliar.\n\n# Optimised to your learning level\n\nStudy at your pace! There is no need to force yourself to reach a fixed goal every day. Wozi allows you to remove impatience and keep your inner peace to appreciate the beauty of each word. Use fragments of time and choose any time to start or end your study according to your mood. \n\n# Scientifically-proven method of learning\n\nJust enjoy your encounters with each new word. But in case you're still wondering, Wozi uses Leitner System to automatically schedule reviews and reinforce your memory. After you've been using Wozi for a while, Wozi will customize your personalized word selection and review plan based on your learning situation."

After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video!

Once you’ve spent time making sand castles and picking out the tastiest food (and ice cream!) for your picnic, it’s time to head to the store and try on diving gear to explore the world UNDER the water, too!

      "label": "This app was developed independently of the MIT Scratch Team, which produces the Scratch programming language and online community. The Scratch name and Scratch cat are trademarks of MIT.\n\n***NOW A TOP TEN EDUCATIONAL APP IN 50 COUNTRIES****\n\n***Ranked #1 educational app in 14 countries***\n\n\"Tutorials for Scratch\" brings you a whole bunch of video tutorials to get you going making your own games in the new version of Scratch 2.0. This are not the sort of standard tutorials that you find on the web. During the videos you will be set tasks to do in scratch and hopefully you will be able to complete them on your own. However don't worry the next video in each project will show you how to complete the task!!\n\nThese videos are really targeted at primary/elementary students although the content will go on to stretch and challenge even the most able of them with variables, cloning, broadcasting and many other features of Scratch. \n\nThere's even a quiz in the app so you can test your scratch knowledge too!!\n\nScratch really is a fantastic way into learning programming and coding and this app hopefully will be a great asset to get you going with it.\n\nThis is a big app of just under 300Mb, because there is so much material in it. You will need to be hooked into your WiFi connection!!  \n\n*TEACHERS* the point of this app is that kids can use the iPad alongside the pc to build their games in Scratch. You can just sit back and relax without having to plan anything. Oh and there is enough material to keep your students busy for around 6 hours, even if they don't manage to have a go at the extension tasks that are identified for all 4 games!!"

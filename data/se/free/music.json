A massive library of different tunings for guitar, bass, balalaika, violin, ukulele and more makes it easy to find more qualities and characteristics from your instrument. \n\nThe interface:\nTo make it more intuitive, we give you information about the current pitch in many different ways:\n\n*Cents for the current pitch\n*A red/green light indicating the closest pitch\n*A note wheel corresponding to the chromatic scale\n*A fretboard with the current tuning setting displayed\n\nStandard guitar is set as default but the guitar tuner can be used to tune many different instruments, such as: \n*Guitars - Standard, 4-string, 5-string, 7-string, 8-string\n, 9-string, 10-string, 11-string, 12-string, and 13-string guitar\n*Bass guitars - Standard, 5-string bass and 6-string bass\n*Ukuleles - std (Soprano), Pocket, Concert, Tenor, Baritone, Bass, and Contrabass\n*Banjo - 4-string, 5-string, 6-string\n*Mandolin family - Mandolin (Soprano), Piccolo, Mandola (alto), Octave Mandolin (tenor), Mandocello (Baritone), Mandobass, Irish Bouzouki, Cittern, and Greek Bouzouki\n*Violin family - Violin, Viola, Cello (violoncello), Double bass and 5-string Double bass\n*Balalaika family - Prima, Piccolo, Secunda, Alto, Tenor, Bass and Contrabass\n\nAfter you have selected an instrument you choose a specific tuning.

ChorusClass is an app that makes it possible for chorus members to practice at home, school, work or anywhere, with a single tap on your phone. \n\nRecord voice or instrument parts and invite members to your chorus. Now your members can practice in between rehearsals. This leaves more time for singing together in the chorus rehearsals.\n\nRecord multipart harmonies with a single tap on your iPhone or iPad and rehearse by muting/unmuting the different parts while you sing along. Recording for yourself is completely free. Upgrade to a PRO account to share your recordings with chorus members or collaborate by having different singers record different parts of the same song.

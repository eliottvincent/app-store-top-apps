In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "Ever since Daniel Ofman in his first book Core Qualities, a Gateway to Human Resources (1992) introduced the Core Quadrant as an easy, simple and very effective way to discover your core qualities, pitfalls, challenges and allergies, core quadrants became part of the Dutch educational system. \nIn the business world, from Universities to high schools to primary schools, everywhere people are encouraged to explore their strength (core quality), their weakness (pitfall), their learning points (challenges) and their personal judgements (allergies). Without exception participants are surprised, inspired and excited to discover the relationships between these four aspects in themselves and others. By now more then a million Dutch people know about core quadrants, and over 100.000 copies of his book have been sold (in the Dutch language only). Core quadrants have virtually become part of the language.\nRecognition and admission are characteristic reactions from each individual who is introduced to the simplicity and logic which made core quadrants so immensely popular.\n \nWith this application you can go one step further. Thru a 16-step Self Analysis you can build and store 16 core quadrants.\nWhat makes this application unique, is the module Daily Reflection, which enables you to reflect on your daily interactions with others or your own behaviour. The application will then look for correlations between the core quadrants you made earlier and the issue you are reflecting on. It will then either give you feedback or invite you to make a new core quadrant. The application is designed to help you to translate the initial insights you got when you built your first core quadrants, into daily practice, in order to benefit from your increased awarenes. Somewhere in Daniel Ofman's latest book on core qualities \"Fancy Meeting Me Here..!?\" it is mentioned: \"The world is not waiting for people to become aware of their core qualities. The world is waiting for people who are willing to make their awareness productive and have meaningful interactions. When awareness about yourself has no effect on what you do and how you deal with people, building a core quadrant makes no sense and is a useless exercise.\"\n   \nWhy do so many people nowadays spend so little time to reflect? Maybe it is because the price we have to pay for awareness is simply too high. This price is namely responsibility. Once you realise and see what is going on and why you behave the way you do, it automatically makes you responsible. Next time you can't say anymore you didn't know. People are not bad, people are often unconscious and the moment you wake up, you bear responsibility and not everyone likes that. This app is meant for people who want to take responsibility for their own lives and their part in relationships with others. Usually this brings success as well as joy."

It will allow you to time across days, for example if you start a job at 8 p.m. and finish at 2 a.m., it will have a duration of 6 hours.\n\nExpenses can be setup for recurring fixed cost items, such as burning a CD, reimbursement of hardware items, or fluid things such as toll expenses, automobile mileage, etc.\n\nQuick reporting can be done on the iPhone / iPod Touch with the Reports function. The report can be emailed in an HTML and/or CSV format.\n\nAdding new Clients, Projects, Tasks and Expenditures is super easy.  You can create them on the fly without having to navigate to a separate maintenance screen. To edit them you can tap on Setup, do you edit and then return to where you left off in Time Entries or Expenses.

      "label": "InerTrak for iPhone and iPad, based on the award-winning desktop InerTrak, is a time-tracking tool for designers, contract workers, lawyers, or anyone who works on multiple projects on an hourly basis. It automatically keeps track of the time you spend on different projects thorughout the day; all you do is click to start and stop the timer.\n\nThe iPad version makes full use of the large screen.\n\nYou can create a list of clients, each with an optional hourly rate.\n\nEach project is associated with a client, and includes an hourly rate (either set automatically from the client's rate, or set individually) which is used to automatically calculate the monetary value of time worked.\n\nA detail view of each project shows the daily totals of both time and money, with the ability to check off days as they are billed. Dates are automatically added when you start the timer, but can also be manually added, if necessary. Time values can be edited, if needed.\n\nProjects can be marked as completed and optionally sorted to the end of the list to get completed projects out of the way of active projects.\n\nA summary view shows the totals of each project -- the total time and money, billed time and money, and unbilled time and money. You can see a summary for any desired time period.\n\nTime values can be displayed in a variety of formats:  hours minutes and seconds; hours and tenths of an hour; hours and sixths of an hour; hours and quarters of an hour; even hours and hundredths of an hour.\n\nYou can create an email message containing the InerTrak data in CSV format. Send it to yourself and then, on your computer, copy and paste the data into Excel or any program that understands CSV format.\n\nYou can add a note or comment to any date. \n\nThe currency symbol can be customized to any one or two characters that you want.\n\nInerTrak for iPhone and iPad is fully integrated with InerTrak for the desktop. You can use InerTrak on your iPhone to keep track of time worked in the field or when away from your desk. Then, with a couple of button clicks, copy that data to the desktop InerTrak and take advantage of more advanced reporting capabilities, print timecards or invoices, etc.\n\nImportant: Data synchronizing requires a wireless network accessible by both your iPhone/iPad and your desktop/laptop computer running InerTrak (version 3.4 or higher). \n\nIf you don't have the desktop InerTrak, you can try it free for 30 days. Download it from www.inertron.com/inertrak.\n\nWhat InerTrak does NOT have:\n\no It has only two levels of terms, Client and Project. It does not allow you to further break down a Project into sub-projects or tasks.\n\no The granularity of time is a day; it keeps track of the total time that you spend on any Project on each day. It does NOT keep track of the individual times that you start and stop the timer throughout the day.\n\nIf you need either of the above features, then InerTrak is not the right product for you.\n\nThere is a detailed user's guide online at: www.inertron.com/mobile/inertrak. The user's guide describes all the features in InerTrak. If there is a feature or capability that you need that is not described there, InerTrak is probably not the right product for you. Feel free, however, to email us and request it; the best way for us to make the product better is to know what people think is missing.\n\nSee a demonstration video of the iPhone version here: www.inertron.com/demo"

      "label": "Version 2.0 Available Now!!\nNow more handsomer, faster, and even more feature packed than ever (New Invoice Section*!).\n\nTimecard Pro is a multi-use app to keep track of your hours worked and your work schedule. It's great for freelance workers, employers to track their employees, or for anyone who wants to see a live view of how much money they're earning. The possibilities of utilizing the app are endless.\n\nSimply add your Job(s) or employees, and then clock in and out whenever needed. At the end of your pay period, you can export your timecards and email a report to your boss or client. Need to clock into multiple jobs, and have a different hourly rate for each? Not a problem, Timecard Pro can handle all of this, without breaking a sweat.\n\n----------------------------------------- \n\nWhat our users are saying: \n\n\"I love it...Life is easy now\" \n\n\"Top Notch, Solid, & Reliable...Click & Forget\" \n\n\"Design and Navigation Success!\" \n\n----------------------------------------- \n\n\nUniversal application: Purchase once, use on both your iPhone and iPad.\n\nFeatures: \n- Easy to use, intuitive interface. Simple, single touch \"Clock in/Clock Out\" dial for on-the-go time tracking.\n- Calendar section allows you to add your work shifts, with pop-up push reminders for when you work, as well as the ability to manually add timecards, and view all of the days you worked or have work scheduled. \n- Users:  Add unlimited users within the app, all with their own separate data. Protect each user data with a password lock.\n- Reports page lets you export multiple Pay Periods, regardless of job, all in the same email with Text, CSV, and PDF export options.\n- 2 Data Backup options, including Email Export, and a built-in 'Restore Data' section.\n- Main display shows money earned, clocked-in time, and how many hours you've worked.\n- Use the menu button on the homepage, to quickly select the job/employee you need to clock into.\n- Clock into multiple jobs/employees at the same time.\n- Icon badge indicator shows how many jobs you're currently clocked into without having to open the app.\n- Set up a different hourly rate for each job.\n- Calculate both daily and weekly overtime hours at the same time.\n- Remain clocked in, even if you turn your phone off! No need to keep the app open. \n- Manually add individual days that you’ve missed.\n- Manually edit timecards to change clocked in/out times, add notes, etc... \n- Add notes for each job or day, and include them in your exported timecard (setting turned on by default). \n- Change Currency Symbol for your specific region.\n- Passcode lock: require a passcode to access app.\n- Automatic 24hr mode detected.\n- Manually sync data between multiple devices, using the backup options. \n- 2 themes (Dark or Light). \n- Updated and optimized for iOS 9. \nAnd many MANY more features to come! \n\niPad version:\n- Completely designed for the iPad, in landscape mode.  With a split screen multi-task feature, you can constantly see the home page on the left to clock in/out of jobs as needed, while you navigate the rest of the app on the right side of the screen.\n\n*In-App Purchase:\n- Invoices:  Create invoices from pay periods, and manually add items (expenses, mileage, etc...).  A beautifully designed invoice will be created, in which a PDF version can be emailed, printed, saved to your Dropbox, or shared.\n\n\nNote to Employers: \nEmployers can add Employees under the \"Jobs\" page instead of entering job names. You can then use the menu from the Home Page to select your employee once they arrive at work, just like a 'job'. Each employee can be set up with a different hourly rate, having their own timecards, etc... \n\nWe love to hear your suggestions!! \nWithout your ideas, we can't shape this app into what YOU need. \nPlease email us at: support@eveleighstudios.com \n\n**Before leaving negative feedback, please contact us to see if we can help you with your concerns.

Using AES encryption, you can rest easy knowing your data is safe and secure.\n\n• Import, Export, Share: It’s easy to import your data from existing files, so getting started is a breeze. Import your data from text, CSV, Bento and more.

      "label": "Supports vSphere 6.7\n\nConnect to your Vmware® vCenter or to your ESX(i) server and take control of your Virtual Machines on the go!\n\nThe ideal application for Data Center Administrators who want to have a life outside of work too! :) It does not replace your vSphere® Client, but it comes really close to it.\n\niVMControl allows you to connect remotely and securely to your Virtualization Hypervisors and monitor the activity on the hosts and on the VMs.\nCapabilities:\n-check alarms, events and task status\n-status for every host and VM\n-Power operations on VMs and Hosts\n-Performance graphs (CPU/memory/NIC/HDD)\n-make/restore/manage snapshots of VMs.\n-Grouping of Hosts into datacenters \n-Grouping of VMs into host systems \n-Multiple vCenter/ESXi connections \n-VMotion support\n-screenshots for VMs\n\nAs in-app purchase we offer the following additional capability:\n- VM console via VNC (this is a one time purchase, it doesn't matter how many virtual machines you have, it's still the price of one in-app).\n\nFor a video demo check:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSOFq_BUa05SqIP6Zu3jKiTxD4BoS4-72\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/IVMControl/175381199162251\n\nConsole support for ESX/vCenter:\n\nPlease note that regardless of the connection point (ESX(i)/vCenter), the console connects *directly* to the ESX host where the VM you want to monitor resides. This implies you need to make sure that your ESX hosts have IP addresses that are *routable*, otherwise you will not be able to access the VNC console. IPs in the form 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x are *not* routable, if your ESX has one of these, you will not be able to access the console through vCenter. Even if the IPs are routable, you need to make sure that the port configured (in the range 5900-5909) is allowed through your firewall for each ESX device you want to connect to.\n\nIn case of a stand-alone ESX(i), a private IP can be used, but the port(s) needs to be forwarded in a similar manner (E.g. if your ESX has IP address 192.168.1.100 and your Internet-facing IP address is say 1.2.3.4, you need to make sure both the SSL port (443) and the VNC ports used (5900-5909) are being forwarded to the *same* IP address - 1.2.3.4:443 -> 192.168.1.100:443 and 1.2.3.4:(5900-5909) -> 192.168.1.100:(5900-5909).\n\nFurthermore, please make note of the fact that only the 8-character password is encrypted with the standard VNC client. All VNC client traffic is sent unencrypted across the network. If security is a concern in your organization, you need to be aware of this. You can disable your VNC terminal once you are done with the Console session (use Configure Console and disable VNC altogether).\n\nVMWare Tools needs to be installed on each and every VM that is monitored through iVMControl's console connection. Check the Vmware knowledge base on other requirements:\n\nhttp://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1246\nMake sure you enable gdbserver through the FW, e.g.\nhttps://www.unixarena.com/2014/02/configuring-vmware-esxi-virtual-machine-console-vnc.html/\n\nUsage:\n- Single click, pan and zoom are standard as any iPhone application\n- Tap with two fingers for right click\n- Ctrl-Alt-Del button sends a Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence to the VM\n- Keyboard button will raise/lower the keyboard.\n\n** NOTE ** VMware decided to offer read-only access to the management APIs for the *FREE* version of ESXi. This applies to all management applications, and is enforced by VMware. What this means for iVMControl is that if you have a FREE ESXi, you will be able to use only the 'read-only' (monitoring) functions of iVMControl."

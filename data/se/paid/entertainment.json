      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

When Bomb Jacke is jumping if tap Bomb Jacke glides in the air.\n\nThe Game\n-------------\n\nThe player controls Bomb Jacke, a superhero mighty mouse who can leap and glide. Someone has planted 24 bombs at landscapes. Bomb Jacke must fly around the screen to collect the bombs. Each screen uses a different configuration of platforms upon which Bomb Jacke may run and jump. Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty.\n\nBomb Jacke \"defuses\" the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb's fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching 20 or more bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Bomb Jacke may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game's bonuses and power-ups. The lit fuses have no strategic purpose other than the bonus; a lit bomb left unattended does not explode.\n\nYou control Bomb Jacke throughout the game. Bomb Jacke one and only mission is to collect all of the bombs in the stage before moving on to the next and collecting more. In his way will be several enemies which will seek to stop him. Bomb Jacke will lose one life any time he comes into contact with any of the enemies. There is no time limit, so Bomb Jacke can take as long as he needs to clear the stage. However, the longer you wait, the more likely it is that the enemies will overwhelm him. Bomb Jacke can turn the tables on his enemies by collecting a power coin (P), which will temporarily turn all of the enemies into coins which he can collect. Whether Bomb Jacke earns extra lives by reaching certain coins.\n\nPower Coin (P), Obtainable after meter filling the Bonus Multiplier 20 segments: unlit bombs by 1, and lit bombs by 2.\n\nBonus Coin (B), Obtainable every time the score reaches a multiple of 5,000, until the Bonus Multiplier reaches x5 per level.\n\nExtra Coin (E), Obtainable when Bomb Jacke has \"killed\" enough enemies by collecting them as Coins, and score reaches multiple of 50,000.\n\nEnjoy it!!!!"

      "label": "Finally an easy control of your music collection on your Kodi server! A Kodi/XBMC remote control specifically designed for music lovers - wrapped in a slim and elegant user interface!\n\nNot ready to get it yet? Check out the free version \"Kodi/XBMC Music Remote\" (not all features included).\n\nFind more information at http://kodimusicremote.com.\nGet help at http://kodimusicremote.com/support.\nFind the manuals at http://kodimusicremote.com/manuals.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the app for those who manage and play their music collection via the Kodi/XBMC media center. Unlike other Kodi/XBMC remote control apps, this app is solely focused on handling your music collection.\n\nHighlights:\n* Local favorites: Create a list of favorite artists, albums, songs, radio stations, etc.\n* Shortcuts panel: Provides customizable quick actions, i.e., wake up the server, switch between servers, fade out the music, etc.\n* Widget for quick control (from the lock screen, by force touch on the app icon, or from the notification center)\n* Browse your music collection offline - it is cached entirely on your device! (important note: the music itself is not copied to the device and cannot be played on the device)\n* Smart search: search artist, albums, and titles at the same time\n* Fuzzy search: e.g., \"Robby\" will also find \"Robbie\"\n* Context aware search results - for example, search for a title, and open the related artist and his albums\n* Artist and album details - view the Kodi info, search the web, or browse Wikipedia, YouTube, or Amazon for infos about your favorite music\n* Display the lyrics of the current song - even synchronized. Show lyrics of the CU LRC add-on, embedded lyrics, or search the web for lyrics\n\nFurther features:\n* Different views of your music library: \"Artists\", \"Albums\", \"Songs\", \"Compilations\", \"Folders\", \"Playlists\", “Recent Music”\n* Access to music add-ons – play radio, podcasts, etc.\n* Resize the \"Now Playing” panel by swiping up/down or pinching\n* Adjustable cover size, up to full device width on iPhones\n* Extensive sorting options\n* Genre filter - works everywhere (even with last added/played tracks/albums)\n* Match your iTunes playlists with your Kodi/XBMC music library to play them on Kodi/XBMC\n* Sort, edit, and clear the play queue\n* Play queue modes: Shuffle, Repeat single track, Repeat all, Party Mode\n* Show codec, sample rate, and bitrate of currently playing track\n* Party restrictions - only allow adding single tracks to the play queue\n* Play from here - play the current track and all following tracks of its album/playlist\n* Different queue options: Queue at the end or queue after the currently playing track\n* See the remaining playing time and total number of tracks of the play queue\n* Shows running library scans/cleanups\n* Wake-on-LAN (WOL) the Kodi/XBMC server (manually or on startup)\n* Server operations:  Shutdown, restart, suspend, hibernate, rescan music library, clean music library\n* Active ongoing development, strongly based on customer feedback (join us at http://kodimusicremote.com/support).\n\nExtensive Device Support:\n* Optimized for iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 plus, and iPhone X (including split screen mode in landscape view)\n* Supports multitasking on iPad (slide over on iPad Air/Air 2, split view on iPad Air 2)\n* Adapted for iPad Pro\n* Well-suited for slower Kodi devices (like Raspberry PI) and large music collections, because the entire music collection is cached locally\n\nThe app requires a Kodi/XBMC installation connected to the wireless network. Its IP-address can be set manually, or zero-conf can be used to automatically find Kodi/XBMC in the network. Officially supported are XBMC 12 and 13 (Frodo and Gotham) and Kodi 14-19 (Helix, Isengard, Jarvis, Krypton, Leia, and Matrix).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for using the app - we hope it makes your Kodi/XBMC music listening experience really enjoyable."

Will you find the aliens?\n\nSpecial Features:\n- Many geometries to explore the colour of your sounds\n- Mood light mode for music-responsive ambient light projection\n- Science page to learn more about our senses\n- Secret modes to unlock\n\nInstructions:\n1: The visualisation will begin immediately. Speak to your device or play music. Select different geometries with 2 fingers.\n2: Instructions are included in the app, you can access them any time with two fingers.\n\nThe art of synesthesia:\nAs trippy psychedelic synesthesia art, this app is an exploration of the relationship between our audio and visual senses, and the nature of our consciousness.\n\nThe science of the senses:\nYour eyes contain 3 colour receptive cells, each having different sensitivities within the perceptible light spectrum. At the same time, your ears have different sensitivities over the audible spectrum. In addition, our eyes and ears re-adjust depending on the intensity of light and sound. Using real data on the nature of our sensory organs, the ambient sound spectrum picked up by your device's microphone is converted into light in real-time, so you can for the first time see the colour of your voice, music, nature and environment.\n\n\nThis app forms part of a larger project of synesthesia and sound visualisation. For more information, apps and more details about the science involved, please visit the blog site:\nhttp://bensoundcolour.blogspot.jp/\nIf you would like to contribute music for a future release, or use this process in your own projects, live performances, VJ sets, or other, please send me an email."

Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science. While the periodic table in Toca Lab: Elements is accurate, the way new elements are created is not. Instead, it’s a fun way to experiment, discover and create curiosity in the world of science. Toca Lab: Elements is just a starting point for further exploration! \n\n***\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Når føllet er født, kan du også se hvilken dag i drektigheten føllet ble født på, og hvor mange dager gammelt det er i tiden etter fødsel.\n\n\r\n\r\nFoalFollow er utviklet for å hjelpe deg med å holde oversikt, og gi tips og råd på veien mot fødsel! Enten du er oppdretter eller har drektig hoppe for første gang, så vil appen ha verktøy som kan gjøre det lettere å holde oversikt. Du kan legge inn så mange hopper du vil. \n\n\r\n\r\nAppen inneholder verktøy som navneliste, sjekkliste, kalender og ikke minst artikler. Artiklene er skrevet i samarbeid med veterinær, for å sikre brukerne våre korrekt informasjon. Med navnelisten kan du legge inn dine favorittnavn på det kommende føllet. Sjekklisten bidrar til å hjelpe deg med å huske viktige gjøremål som er aktuell for din hoppe, som for eksempel ultralyd, vaksinasjon, ormekur og innkjøp. \n\n\r\n\r\nI tillegg har man mulighet til å følge hoppens drektighet måned for måned, hvor man får informasjon om hva som skjer med kroppen, fôring, trening og eventuelle sykdommer under en drektighet. Fosterets utvikling og hva som skjer inne i magen, får man også følge måned for måned. NB! Denne funksjonen er kun tilgjengelig i full versjon av FoalFollow. Full versjon av appen er foreløpig ikke tilgjengelig på markedet.\n\n\r\n\r\nTell ned dager til termin, og les deg opp til fødselen! I tillegg kan du lese om historien bak FoalFollow, hvem som står bak og samarbeidspartnere."

Thanks to the magnetometers present in the latest generation mobile phones *, you too can try your hand at researching variations in the electromagnetic field.\n\nIts functions are similar to those of a KII but enhanced for use on a smartphone. The more the electromagnetic field variations will be strong, the more the LEDs will light up to red.\n\nREM:\n\nThe Rem is an electronic device that allows you to receive answers to your questions.\n\nThe Rem has a built-in word database. Whenever a considerable variation in electromagnetism is recorded, the amplitude and intensity values ​​are combined to select a word from the reference database.\n\nThe first screen will show the word while the second will record the electromagnetism variations that caused the selection of that word.\n\nBLACK BOX:\nThis fantastic instrument perceives random chaotic noise and connects to a phonetic database from which it is possible to listen to the formation of words divided into syllables. Ask your question and listen to the answers that will come. Try to understand the words that will come out by joining the single phonemes.\n\nINFO ON OPERATION:\n\nTo test m1 just enter M1 function and approach an electrical socket or an electronic device on and the instrument will immediately show a change in magnetism.\n\nThanks to an algorithm developed by Team Pit, the App creates a triangulation between the three magnets inside the latest generation mobile phones to accurately calculate the magnetic anomalies in the environment.\n\n*ATTENTION*\n\nIn older mobile phones without the 3 magnetometers now used in most mobile phones, the app will not work properly and the M1 will light up with just the movement of the mobile phone. This is because it will simulate a compass and give false positive answers to just the movement of the mobile. \""

Take a ride on the airplane, shoot some hoops, play hide & seek and bed trampoline or get creative with paw painting - you can always have a great time with your kitten pal! Explore the kitten's world and discover cute animations, laugh with and care for your adorable, realistic pet.\nThe unique game-design encourages children to explore the room with minimal use of icons or menus. The 7 mini-games offer a wide variety of interactions and are designed so they appeal to a wide age range. The philosophy is not about winning, losing or competition, it's about having fun in a child-friendly environment and learning without even realizing it! Great Mini-Games with purpose!:\n\nCompatibility: The App doesn't support iPad2, iPhone 4s, iPad Mini1, iPod5 with iOS9\n\n1) Kitten Hide&Seek - encourages focus and attention.\n2) Paw Painting - creativity unleashed! Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children. Parents have the option to limit screen time for their kids: after a chosen time, the kitten gets tired and goes to sleep.\nLittle Kitten is a high-tech app - using the latest 3d animation technology to create the visuals, it also uses cutting edge programming to maximize the user experience on your apple device. Enjoy the premium quality content in this original app brought to you by Squeakosaurus.

      "label": "From the brilliant idea and creation of Angelo Carbone, the app was developed by magician and developer Alessandro Albergo.\n\nIt’s back! After many years off the App Store.\nMagic SMS was first released back in 2011. Then Magic SMS 2 was released in 2015. Now here in 2022 we have Psychic Prediction.\n\nThis app is for entertainment purposes only.\n\n\"The best magic trick app that I've seen; beautifully thought through.\" - Derren Brown\n\n\"This is such a strong and effective use of magic on the iPhone. Finally!\" - David Blaine\n\n\"Magic SMS is the coolest effect I've seen in years! Trust me you'll be texting everyone about this. Amazing!\" - Dynamo\n\n\"Magic SMS represents a real leap forward in the development of iPhone magic. If you have an iPhone and like magic, you should buy it.\" - MAGIC Magazine Review\n\n* As performed live on London's LBC Radio and one of LBC Radio's Best Apps of the Year. *\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nImagine a magic app that does not look like you are running an app...\n\nImagine a magic app that creates powerful mind reading magic...\n\nIntroducing Magic SMS 2... Mind Reading via Text Message.\n\n\nThe Effect: You tell your friend that you know someone who is psychic and that you want to put him to the test. You ask your friend to freely think of any colour and any playing card. Nothing is spoken or written down.\n\nYou send a text message to your psychic asking him to guess what your friend is thinking of. You then turn off your phone and put it aside. From this point on you NEVER touch the phone AGAIN.\n\nYou both patiently wait for the text message to arrive. Moments later, an SMS does arrive. The preview message in the Lock Screen shows that it is indeed from the psychic. Now that the message has arrived you ask your friend for the first time to confirm what they had thought of.\n\nYou ask your friend to pick up the phone (as you don’t want to touch it) and to read the full reply. They will be utterly amazed to see that the psychic has correctly guessed both the freely thought of colour and playing card.\n\nWOW!\n\n\n• Easy to do but very POWERFUL in effect!\n• The FIRST EVER magic app to use this UNIQUE principle.\n• No voice activation, G-Sensor use, icon swiping or suspicious turning over of the phone.\n• No masking or hiding of the screen. Everything is done openly and fairly.\n• You NEVER touch the phone, once the text has been sent.\n• Once you know what colour and card your friend has thought of you STILL never touch the phone.\n• SMS reply can be customised to say whatever you want.\n• 9 routines plus new improvements from the original Magic SMS app.\n• A truly free choice of ANY colour and ANY playing card. A staggering 530 possible combinations.\n\n** SUPPORTED LANGUAGES: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish and Portuguese.**\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSUPPORT INFORMATION\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any issues, please contact magicsms@live.com or allab.developer@gmail.com before leaving a review and we will be happy to assist."

      "label": "DRIVING BY RAIL\nIn \"Little Fox Train Adventures\", children can travel by train through enchanting landscapes and visit various places. At farms and factories, they help to load and unload the wagons, produce goods and deliver them to the next city. Lovely illustrations, fun animations and simple controls make the app suitable even for little children.\n\nBRING IN THE HARVEST AND LOAD THE TRAIN\nKids can bring in the harvest and load the train at over 10 different farms. They help to harvest fruit trees and vegetable fields, collect eggs from the chicken farm or milk the cows.\n\nTAKE YOUR HARVEST TO THE FACTORY\nThe harvest must now be taken to factories to process it. Whether it's carrot cupcakes, peach ice cream or socks made of alpaca wool - in over 20 factories, children can playfully learn about production processes, play an active part in them and trigger fun animations.\n\nSELL THE GOODS IN THE CITY\nAs soon as juice, cake or cheese have been loaded at the factory, the next stop will be the big city. The citizens are already waiting for new supply, so bring your goods to the supermarket quickly. But watch out for the gangster sheep, it wants to steal your goods!\n\nPERFECT FOR SMALL CHILDREN\nThe controls are very easy: By tapping you can harvest, load or accelerate the train. So even the younger ones can easily navigate through the app.\n\"Little Fox Train Adventures\" was illustrated by Karoline Pietrowski. With great attention to detail and the use of handmade textures and brushes, the scenes look like a picture book.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS:\n- Easy control, optimized for children between 2 and 5 years\n- Picturesque landscapes\n- Over 30 different stations\n- Funny characters and funny animations\n- Loving graphics and music\n- No internet or WiFi required - play wherever you want!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

      "label": "Do you enjoy watching videos on your iPhone? Do you hate not being able to because your iPhone cannot support the video format? Or do you hate the inconvenient and time-consuming hassle of trying to convert video formats to fit into one that your iPhone can support? \nThis is why the AVPlayer was created. The AVPlayer can play almost any computer video file format such as AVI, Xvid, WMV and much more clearly and effortlessly. No converting hassles. Just copy files via USB and just drag and drop into the AVPlayer’s Media Explorer. \nThe AVPlayer can also support external subtitle files such as SMI and SRT. So if you enjoy watching videos on your iPad, then the AVPlayer is an absolute necessity. \n\n• Support Formats\n- Dolby Digital (AC3), Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3)\n- Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- MP4,MOV,M4V\n- XVID,AVI,WMV,RMVB,ASF,H264,MKV… most of all movie file formats. \n- SMI, SRT, TXT, SubStationAlpha Subtitles \n\n• Post Processing \n- High quality video processing \n- Contrast,Saturation,Brightness \n- TV-Out \n\n• Control the playback speed (From 0.5X to 2.0X) \n- User setting support \n- Sweep to the left : move to backword 10 sec \n- Sweep to the right : move to forward 10 sec \n- Sweep to the top : 1.5X speed \n- Sweep to the down : normal speed \n\n• Additional features \n- Rotation Lock / Aspect ratio:auto/16:9/4:3/Full screen \n- Folder Management:Pass code/Move/Rename/Create \n- Resume play from last position \n- Scrubbing search \n- supports e-mail attachment by \"Open In\" feature \n\n• USB/WIFI Transfer \n\n• Note \n1. How to add video with USB \n- Run iTunes 9.1 or above \n- Device->My Device(My iPad)->Apps, drag and drop files to the AVplayer's documents \n\n2. Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal."

      "label": "You’ve discovered the Original and World Famous iFart® App.  An Apple All-Time TOP 20 App.  The definitive Fart Sounds app on iTunes.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nFeatured on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Today Show and many others, iFart® is considered the most infamous app of all time. \r\n\r\nAlso seen in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, MSNBC.com, MacDailyNews, MacForums, The New York Times, Barron's, Motley Fool, Gizmodo, Venture Beat, Ars Technica, CNET News, Geek.com, Forbes, The UK Register, Information Week, TechCrunch.com and dozens of publications all over the world!\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\niFart® took the app world by storm in 2008. It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

Stop and start talking on multiple conversations whenever you like.\n\nThis app is uniquely designed for the iPhone, with chat bubbles scrolling by.

No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

      "label": "* Note: Strange Rain is not currently compatible with iOS 10. An update is underway. *\n\nWhat makes rain strange? When it's falling on your screen—from the inside.\n\n/ Reached #1 on the Entertainment charts in the U.S., Canada, Italy, Germany and more! /\n\n/ IGN.com Editors Choice / Featured on CNN.com and USAToday.com /\n\n/ \"A glimpse at novels of the future\" —Fast Company's Co.Design /\n\n/ \"Think of it as a first-person thinker.\" —Paste Magazine /\n\n/ \"This gentle, compelling and beautiful artwork invokes a dreamy, poetic state...\" —KCET /\n\nStrange Rain turns your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch into a skylight on a rainy day. Raindrops fall and splatter on your screen, shifting perspective as you tilt your device. Touch the screen and guide the path of the raindrops, stepping through the notes of an eerie melody as you go. It’s a relaxing, intriguing experience that feels as if you’re holding a living window in your hands.\n\nThe more you touch, however, the more strange the rain becomes: layered skies, visual anomalies and shifts in speed and color, even the occasional cataclysm if you’re not careful. Before your eyes and beneath your fingers, the familiar becomes strange, and the strange, familiar.\n\nStrange Rain has three play modes. In \"wordless\" mode, you can simply enjoy the sights and sounds of the falling rain. In \"whispers\" mode, touching the screen causes some raindrops to turn into words as they fall—words inspired by the qualities of rain.\n\nIn \"story\" mode, every touch triggers a thought as text on screen. These thoughts tell the story of a man in the midst of a family crisis who has wandered into the rain to collect his thoughts. His world, too, has gone from familiar to strange, even as his beliefs are following the opposite course. Your interaction helps determine when and how he decides to come in from the rain.\n\nStrange Rain features interactive music that responds directly to your touch. In addition to the default music included with the original release, two additional scores by composers Chris Schlarb and Michael Gordon Shapiro can now be downloaded for free within the app.\n\nA unique combination of touchscreen play and interactive storytelling, the living sky of Strange Rain awaits your touch.\n\n|--- FEATURES ---|\n\n- Your very own portable rainy day\n- Guide the rain with touch\n- 3D perspective shifts as you tilt your device\n- Music that responds to your touch\n- Supports Game Center achievements\n- Supports the Retina Display\n- Three play modes: wordless, whispers, and story\n- Story mode lets you trigger thoughts with every touch\n- Three unique musical scores (one included, two free downloads)\n- Two raindrop styles (clear and black)\n- Includes a sleep/meditation timer\n- Listen to music from your iPod as you play, or listen to the rain sounds while using other apps\n- Real-time hints and tutorials available to help you get the most out of the experience\n- Universal app for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION: www.opertoon.com\nCONTACT US: info@opertoon.com\nON TWITTER: www.twitter.com/opertoon\nON FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/opertoon"

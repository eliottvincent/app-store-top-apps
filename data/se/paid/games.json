Realms is a monthly subscription service that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you won't be refunded for the remaining active period of the subscription.\n\nHere are links to our privacy policy and terms of use:\n- Privacy policy: https://account.mojang.com/terms#privacy\n- Terms of use: https://account.mojang.com/terms"

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.\n\nThe stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root."

      "label": "Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler RPG that's simple to get into but hard to master! Every game is a unique challenge, with four different heroes, randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. ShatteredPD is also updated once every two or three months, so there's always something new.\n\n◀ Choose Your Hero ▶\nEach of ShatteredPD's four playable heroes has their own unique mechanics and gameplay style. Smash some heads as the durable Warrior, fry your enemies as the arcane Mage, or use terrain to your advantage as the stealthy Rogue or the markswoman Huntress!\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll earn points to spend on talents, choose a subclass, and gain powerful lategame abilities. You can turn the Warrior into a combo-building Gladiator, the Mage into a soul-sucking Warlock, the Huntress into a tanky Warden, or explore loads of other possibilities!\n\n◀ Explore the Dungeon ▶\nShatteredPD's dungeon is procedurally generated with random layouts, room types, items, traps, and enemies. In each game you'll find equipment and collect or craft consumable items to power you up or help you out in a pinch. There is a huge variety to what you might see from run to run and region to region.\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll find equipment that can be enchanted, upgraded, and augmented as you outfit your hero. Set foes ablaze with an enchanted weapon, wade through enemies with upgraded armor, or gain powerful damage, defensive, or utility benefits from one of the many wands, rings, or magical artifacts.\n\n◀ Succeed or Die Trying ▶\nThe Dungeon is filled with enemies, traps, hazards, and bosses intent on ending your run! Battle hostile wildlife in the sewers and caves, mad thieves and guards in the prison, occult servants in the fallen dwarven city, and maybe something even worse further down...\n\nAll these hazards can make the game quite tough, but don't be discouraged! You probably won't win on your first try, but there are many tricks and strategies to discover and learn on the path to getting your first win!\n\n◀ Almost A Decade in the Making ▶\nShattered Pixel Dungeon is an open source game based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon by Watabou (first released in 2013). It started in 2014 as a project to rebalance Pixel Dungeon but has steadily grown into its own game over the last 8 years!\n\nFeatures Include:\n• 4 Heroes, each with 2 subclasses, 3 endgame abilities, and over 25 talents.\n• Over 250 items including equipment, consumables, and items crafted via alchemy.\n• 5 dungeon regions, 26 floors, over 100 room types, and trillions of possible floor layouts.\n• Over 60 enemy types, 30 traps, and 5 detailed bosses to test your skills.\n• 9 optional challenges and over 100 achievements for completionists.\n• Interface modes for large and small screens, and support for multiple input types.\n• Updates every 2-3 months with new content, fixes, and improvements.\n• Support for many languages thanks to the game's dedicated communities."

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

You will be the skipper, the helm-man and will also trim the sails.\n\nThe main features of this realistic sailing game are:\n\n- Online sailing: sail against real people!\n- Or play in 'solo' mode: you'll compete against the computer, with different difficulty levels.\n- A perfect way to refine your sailing techniques and tactics, or to learn how to sail in life-like situations. \n- For beginners, cWind can coach you from marker to marker, by means of steering helps and progressive tutorials.\n- A very complete instruments panel will give you all the data you'll need to brew a winning tactic and arrive first on the finishing line. But if you find that's too much, you can switch back to the 'basics'.\n- Several boat types, from a 19th century cutter to the latest Imoca 60 footer. And now a new beach catamaran. The boats have their own characteristics and need to be sailed accordingly.\n- Several regatta courses, some easy to start with, others very difficult to complete. Some of the regattas are even more challenging than what you'll ever encounter on real water! So make sure you choose the right boat for those... and keep her well trimmed at all times!\n- The game implements the ISAF 2013-2016 racing rules of sailing. Respect them or you'll be penalised, like in real regattas!\n- An on-screen radar will show you a tactical view of the course and will guide you from marker to marker.\n- Two game modes: pure regattas, or regattas \"with a twist\", where you will hunt for \"magic things\" on the course to capsize the other boats, steal their wind, give you a turbo boost, and more...\n\nYou will have to use the wind and tidal currents to your advantage. You will steer the boat by tilting your phone, and you will trim your sails yourself for maximum speed.\n\nFair Winds and Following Seas!"

Some of its key features are:\r\n- Create multiple parties to maintain the state of multiple campaigns at once.\r\n- Allow for multiple devices to synchronize at the same time, allowing remote play, or everyone around the table to see all stats without sharing their device.\r\n- Choose which scenario the group wants to play, and the application will automatically set up all the monster stats, monster ability decks, and loot deck for that scenario.\r\n- Mark each scenario as started or completed, and track your progress.\r\n- The application supports opening sections in a scenario. Doing so will automatically instantiate the monsters (normal & elite) in that section.\r\n- At any point you can draw from the Monster or Ally Attack Modifier deck, or from an extra Boss deck.\r\n- Input the initiative of your heroes and draw Monster Ability cards for each of the monsters. Heroes and enemies will automatically be sorted by initiative, and the ability cards of each monster drawn and revealed.\r\n- Support for auto calculations of move and attack values on Monster Ability Cards.\r\n- Maintains the hp, xp, loot, and the various conditions of each of your heroes and monsters easily.\r\n- Create Summons from your Hero, and track their various statistics.\r\n- Create NPCs and set their name and hp, as well as their conditions. You can also input their initiative or snooze them.\r\n- Maintains the status of the 6 Elements.\r\n- Stop at any point, and resume your session in the state it was when you left.\r\n- Undo or redo any actions between each round.\r\n- If you do not want to input player initiatives, you can disable player initiative or even hide players.\r\n- If you do not want to play a pre-made scenario, create your own custom session by adding any monsters from the game.\r\n- The app takes into account the majority of the scenario and sections special cards and hp for monsters."

      "label": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

Murder, romance, rebellion and intrigue await! \n\nThe app is networked, with a feed that shows you the position of all the other players of the game, their routes, triumphs and disasters. You can race to be the fastest - or look ahead to learn the secrets of the world.\n\nShare your own journey with friends, and load other's routes directly into your app so you can race head-to-head.\n\n80 DAYS is a complete experience, with no in-app purchases, and was made by a core team of just four people.

      "label": "Kingdom Two Crowns is a side-scrolling micro strategy game with a minimalist feel wrapped in a beautiful, modern pixel art aesthetic. Play the role of a monarch atop their steed and recruit loyal subjects, build your kingdom and protect it from the greedy creatures looking to steal your coins and crown. \r\n\r\nIn the brand-new campaign mode, monarchs must now work to build a kingdom that stands over time until finding a way to defeat the Greed for good. Explore the environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep. \r\n\r\nBut you don’t have to rule alone! Introducing cooperative play to Kingdom Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together locally in classic split screen while sitting next to your fellow monarch, or even across from them on opposite sides of the device in the custom mobile feature of tabletop coop.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also includes: \r\n\r\n• Dead Lands: Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from Bloodstained the mythic demon horse “Gamigin” with its powerful charge attack. Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!\r\n\r\n• Shogun: Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to keep the feeling of exploration, discovery, and strategy alive in Kingdom Two Crowns in post-release updates with more themed settings, each with unique styles that marvel the eye while changing how you rule the lands.\r\n\r\nA challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall reign stronger than one!"

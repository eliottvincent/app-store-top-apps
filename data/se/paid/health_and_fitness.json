Bara några få yinyogapass kan göra den skillnaden i ditt liv.\n\nYinyoga passar alla åldrar och kroppstyper. Den kan göras av vem som helst, när som helst och var som helst. Du behöver inte någon särskild utrustning eller ens byta kläder. Den är en av de enklaste yogastilarna. Den gör stela muskler smidiga, strama leder rörliga och ett rastlöst sinne stabilt. Nyckeln är att ligga länge i ställningarna, tre eller fem minuter (om du kan), eller längre.\n\nI denna app har jag samlat mina mest populära klasser och pass. Förutom många längre, allmänna yogapass är en del skapade för specifika problem, som Jetlag eller Huvudvärk, medan andra är för en specifik situation, exempelvis TV-passet eller Efter jobbet.\n\nJag leder dig in och igenom alla yogaställningar med min röst, precis som om du var elev på en av mina yinyogaklasser. Jag tajmar dig till tre eller fem minuter, och stödjer dig medan du ligger i ställningarna.\n\nDen bästa yogan är den som blir av, och med min app har det aldrig varit lättare att starta och upprätthålla din yinyoga hemma.\n\nMin önskan och förhoppning är att yinyoga ska öka din energi och vitalitet, göra dig vig och lugn. Lägg dig i de enkla ställningarna, slappna av och låt livet ha sin gång.\n\nOm du yinyogar en gång om dagen är det fantastiskt.\nOm du yinyogar en gång i veckan är det fantastiskt.\nOm du yinyogar en enda gång är det också fantastiskt!\n\n— Magdalena Mecweld\n\n- - -\n\n• Appen innehåller alla 30 yinyogaställningar, upplästa av författaren och beskrivna i vackra bilder och tydliga texter.\n\n• Appen innehåller 30 yinyogapass. Sammanlagt många timmars lärarledd yinyoga för mindre än priset av en yogaklass!\n\n• Appen innehåller även en längre ledd vila och en lång mindfullness-meditation.\n\n• Appen har en funktion för att välja favoritpositioner och skapa ett eget yinyogapass. Du kan även dela ditt pass till vänner.\n\n• Allt material i appen laddas ned och ingen internetanslutning behövs efter installation.\n\n• Appen är optimerad för alla Apple-enheter, både iPhones och iPads. \n\n• Med endast ett köp kan appen installeras i alla dina enheter som har samma iTunes-konto.\n\n- - -\n\nSVENSKSPRÅKIG APP\n\nObservera: denna app är endast på svenska. Den engelska appen heter “Yin yoga”.\n\n- - -"

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

With the help of real-time biofeedback, your breath, mind and heart increasingly flow as one.\n\nVaYou Breath integrates with Apple Health by updating your values for resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and mindful minutes.\n\nKey VaYou benefits\n\n• Biometric Integration - VaYou provides advanced real-time breath and pulse detection without the need for additional wearables or expensive medical sensors.\n• We have gone to the technical limits. VaYou converts the iOS motion/acceleration sensor data stream into high quality biosignals for breath and pulse (pulse only in lying position).\n• In order to support the relaxation process, the VaYou algorithms learn from your biosignals and derived parameters how to best design the sounds so that they are most effective for you at that moment.\n• No online connection needed while using - activate airplane mode for an undisturbed and healthy experience!\n\nNo other app or desktop software provides biofeedback like VaYou Breath.\n\nJust listening to the breath-generated sounds leads you into a very personal flow experience. Your consciousness is more and more \"absorbed\" by the process, your thoughts come to rest. The mental state can be described as relaxed and calming breath mindfulness. It is almost automatic to \"stay with the breath\", easily and effortless.  \n\nUnlike with apps where you have to understand and follow spoken instructions, with VaYou Breath you can \"switch off\" right from the start. The resulting flow experience brings body and mind into harmony and this has a regenerating effect.\n\nThe regular use of VaYou Breath can have a generally positive effect on body and mind. Some of the reported effects are\n• Calming the flow of thoughts\n• Reduction of stress levels\n• Self regulation of the heart and breathing activity\n• Increase of creativity\n• Improvement of mood\n• Improvement of sleep.\n\nIT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT:\n\nPut on good headphones and choose one of the perfected Sound~Flows. Then select the duration, press START and place the iPhone on your lower abdomen, just below the navel. (It's usually better to loosen a belt if you wear one and slide the iPhone halfway into the belt line of your trousers or skirt.) Keep breathing and listening! \n\nLIVE 1 and LIVE 2 is the app's main biofeedback mode. To be even more flexible, there is also a PACING mode, in which an adjustable breathing rhythm is played, which you simply breathe along. Without the need to look at the screen.\n\nIt is actually very easy to get into your personal \"Flow~Breathing\" and to experience and enjoy the balancing positive effect. \n\nWHAT YOU GET:\n\n▪ The VaYou biofeedback algorithm that turns your breathing movements into amazing Sound~Flows\n▪ The \"Flow Journey\" Sound~Flow, which guides you through a universe of different breath~sound experiences up to 30 minutes duration\n▪ The \"Four Fully\" Sound~Flow for very effective and recreational short breaks\n▪ All other Sound~Flows can be downloaded as in-app purchases within the app. And of course you get them for your LIFETIME, even if you change or loose your device. \n\nPRICES:\n\n• No subscription, no automatic renewal\n• No hidden costs or unnecessarily large packages\n• You only pay what you really like and want.\n\nWishes, questions and feedback are always welcome: welcome@vayou.app\nor at https://vayou.app/usergroup\n\nVaYou is Time for You.\nNOW is Time for You!"

Fördelarna med att befinna sig i detta medvetandetillstånd är många:\n\n*  Djupt liggande fysiska, mentala och emotionella spänningar frigörs \n\n*  Kropp och sinne får mycket effektiv vila och återhämtning \n\n*  Yoga Nidra reducerar de negativa effekterna av stress såsom hjärtproblem, högt \nblodtryck, sömnproblem etc. \n\n*  Effekterna av Yoga Nidra fortsätter även efter övningen och vi blir mer medvetna och \navslappnade i vardagen, även i situationer som annars kan upplevas som stressande \n\n*  Vi kan i detta avslappnade och sömnliknande tillstånd lära oss att bevittna tankar, känslor \noch bilder som stiger upp ur vårt undermedvetna utan att identifiera oss med dessa, \nvilket ökar vår självkännedom \n\n I den fullständiga versionen appen får du också möjlighet att omforma och utveckla din personlighet med hjälp av en ”Sankalpa”, ett beslut som planteras djupt i ditt undermedvetna och leder tankar, känslor och beteende i en bestämd riktning\nYoga Nidra är inspelad av Mattias Gopala Hagman, yoga- och meditationslärare, beteendevetare och ayurvedisk hälsorådgivare. Han startade Gävle Yogaskola 2001 och är affilierad till Satyananda Yoga Sverige samt International Yoga Fellowship Movement. Han håller regelbundna kurser och föredrag till allmänheten, företag och organisationer. Sedan 2006 är han även en av ledarna för den nationella yogalärarutbildningen inom Satyananda Yoga Sverige.\n\nMer info och kontakt: www.gavleyogaskola.se samt www.sys.se"

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "Slow Eats is an interval timer app aimed at helping you slow down and stay mindful during eating. Slow eating facilitates a healthy relationship with food and can ultimately lead to weight loss.\n\nEating slowly has many possible benefits:\n    ● Promotes weight loss by giving your brain more time to receive fullness signals\n    ● Helps you better absorb the nutrients in your food\n    ● Improves digestion\n    ● Makes you feel calmer and more in control\n    ● Increases your enjoyment of food\n\nChoose between three types of timers:\n    ● Bite Timer: Slow down how fast you eat by creating a set pause between each bite.\n    ● Meal Timer: Slow down how fast you eat by defining set eating and break windows during your meal.\n    ● Seconds Timer: Create a mindful pause before you get more. Give yourself time to feel full before deciding you need more.\n\n______________________________________\n\n~ What users are saying about the app ~\n\n\"I’ve never written an app review before, but I need to write one for this app. I got an Apple Watch and was determined to use it to lose weight. Between closing my rings and using this app, I have lost over 25 lbs. Even more important than any one accomplishment: it helped heal my unhealthy relationship with food.\"\n\n\"I eat way too fast. I get hungry and just smash my dinner every day and then often feel bad from over eating. This app is exactly what I was looking for. It’s simple, it’s easy to use, and it works. I love how I don’t have to watch a timer I just wait for the tap on my wrist. I’m already building healthier eating habits by using this app. THANK YOU!!\"\n\n\"Have been trying to slow down and be able to better listen to my fullness cues when I eat! This watch app does the trick!\"\n\n\"I tell anyone who will listen how much I love this app. I have the icon on my watch face and I use it for every meal and snack. So easy to use and it has helped me so much as I’ve been trying to slow down while eating. Another bonus is that the developers are so responsive and helpful! Hands down my favorite app!\"\n\n_______________________________________\n\nStart building a healthier relationship with food today by simply slowing down.\n\nLearn More:\n- https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eating-slowly-and-weight-loss#thorough-chewing\n- https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mindful-eating-guide\n\nAvailable on the Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, and Mac."

You will get better contact with your inner abdominal muscles and learn how to better activate the seat muscles.\n\nFOR THE MOM WHO WANTS TO GET STARTED\nThe app consists exercises and workout programs for moms - no matter how long since you were pregnant - the workout programs are designed for both moms with new-borns and mothers with older children.\n\nThe difference between newly pregnants moms and mothers who just did not get started with the training yet (the child may be a teenager) is the number of times you repeat each exercise program.\n\nThe app is also for moms who has get started, maybe a bit sporadic but now it feels like it's time to start properly and from scratch.\n\nHOW TO USE THE APP\nStart with workout program 1 and then continue at your own pace. Exercise one or more training programs per time. Exercise each workout program as many times as it feels good, once you get started and taken you through all workout programs, you can then choose the workouts  you feel you need the most and focus on them.\n\nThe workouts gradually increase in difficulty, it’s not an even leaning staircase, but the exercises are introduced in the \"right\" order to get started with the training in a good way.\n\nUse the app regularly, 3-5 times a week for 10-12 weeks and then you will have a stronger mom body.\n\nTRAIN FOR ONLY 5-15 MINUTES\nWorkouts are quick to done and you can train them separately or combine with power walking or other fitness training if you want to, for example, you can practice one or more workout programs after a spin or dance class.\n\nBY CAROLINE NILSSON\nThe workouts are designed by the Swedish personal trainer and mother of three Caroline Nilsson, who runs several popular training sites in Sweden and has helped many mothers get in shape. Caroline has developed several training apps together with the business woman and system developer Susanne Jarl.\n\nWORKOUT APPS POWORKOUT\nMom in shape is an app in the series Poworkout (which is a brand that stands for \"powerful workouts\"), the other training apps are Trim & Tone (body weight training) and Ball & Band (workouts with exercise ball and exercise band)."

      "label": "It can be greatly distressing when tinnitus first presents itself. This may be expressed as sleepless nights, concentration difficulties, tension, irritability and restlessness. The resulting stress could result in an even greater focus on the tinnitus. In my experience, the sooner you can break this vicious cycle, the better. Your tinnitus will bother you less, and the symptoms will recede and may even disappear. \n\nTinnitus relief is an app designed for anyone suffering from tinnitus. \n\nTinnitus relief contains a fact sheet describing what tinnitus is, how common it is, possible causes and what might make the condition worse. The mechanisms behind hypersensitivity to sound are also explained. It provides exercises and advice to help you cope with your tinnitus in the best possible way.\n\nTinnitus relief will also provide relief for anyone with a history of tinnitus, but where the situation has become more troublesome for some reason. In addition, you can apply the measures in this app in preventive manner, to protect against hearing loss and tinnitus. \n\nThe app includes guided exercises you can use straight away:\n\n• A 6-minute relaxation exercise\n• A 25-minute body scan, which is an exercise in mindfulness that also provides relaxation \n• A 12-minute “sleep ease” exercise that will help you settle down and sleep. \n\nThe more you do the Tinnitus Relief exercises, the easier you will find it to relax, and your tension and anxiety will recede. You will be able to concentrate better and a serene, positive mindset can take root. \n\nTinnitus relief is conceptualized by Helena Löwen-Åberg, certified physiotherapist with a Masters degree. In addition to specialist competence in the areas of psychiatry and psychosomatics, she is a cognitive behavioural therapist, a professional supervisor and a mindfulness instructor.\n\nBased in Gothenburg, Sweden, Ms. Löwen-Åberg deals with stress-related conditions such as tension-related disorders, tinnitus, vertigo, anxiety, pain, and sleep disorders. \n\nShe has extensive experience of teaching relaxation and stress management with a cognitive approach. And gives mindfulness classes, as well as other wellness seminars and lectures.\n\n-----------\nI would like to express my gratitude towards everyone involved in the development of this app and the people who helped me by researching facts and proofreading.\n\nIn particular, I would like to thank Inger Pringle, Registered Nurse/Tinnitus therapist at Sahlgrenska University Hospital; Dr. Dan Hasson, at Karolinska Institute; Dr. Lena Folkestad, MD, PhD, at the ENT Clinic in Borås; and Christer Borg, certified psychologist and psychotherapist in Gothenburg. \n\nIn addition, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues and former supervisors Dr. Kajsa-Mia Holgers, MD, Medical Advisor for the region of Västra Götaland; and Barbro Källén, certified physiotherapist and occupational therapist at Fungera Göteborg AB. \n\nIn connection with the English version, Anja Bergh translated the exercises and that’s her voice you hear, while Ingrid Eng translated and edited the written material – thank you both. \n\nLast but not least, I would like to thank all the patients I’ve had down through the years for teaching me what it is like to have\ntinnitus. \n\nHelena Löwen-Åberg"

Visste du att regelbunden träning gör att hjärnaktiviteten förskjuts från områden som reglerar stress och oro till områden som reglerar lugn, glädje och entusiasm? Mindfulness – Lugn och lycklig är fullmatad med övningar för närvaro, lugn, glädje och lätthet i livet. Låt dig vaggas till ro av dina andetag i övningen kroppsscanning, som är en av de mest uppskattade mindfulnessövningarna och som här finns i tre olika tidslängd. Eller fyll hjärtat med kärleksfull vänlighet, till dig själv och om du vill även till andra. I den liggande meditationen kan du låta sinnet bli lika stilla som en spegelblank skogssjö. Eller varför inte prova en övning i smittande skrattyoga, för skojs skull...\n\nÖvningarna som ingår i denna app är:\n1. Introduktion 3.55\n2. Kort kroppsscanning 10.00\n3. Kroppsscanning 20.00\n4. Lång kroppsscanning 45.00\n5. Kärleksfull vänlighet till mig 14.52\n6. Kärleksfull vänlighet till andra 14.00\n7. Kärleksfull vänlighet till alla 6.12\n8. Liggande meditation 25.03\n9. Skrattyoga (Live) 6.16\n10.

Your phone and all the distractions that come with it are basically blocked.\n\nDo you have a nasty habit of checking your social networks, messenger apps, news sites, just before going to bed? Turn on the focus session one or two hours before sleep. Once the time is up your phone will silently turn off the Focus app and the screen. You can finally go to sleep without cluttering your head beforehand. No more mobile addiction induced insomnia. You can invite more mindfulness into your life.\n\nThis app provides clear statistics displaying how many of your focus sessions were successful and how many times you did not make it to the end.\n\nTreat yourself with some precious iPhone-free time; you play a game of focus against yourself.

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

      "label": "Detta är appen för dig som vill träna Mindfulness på ett enkelt sätt med professionell vägledning. Med sin djupa kunskap och mångåriga erfarenhet har leg specialistsjukgymnast Helena Löwen-Åberg här samlat sina bästa Mindfulness-övningar för dig!\n\n\"Appen Mindfulness av Helena Löwen-Åberg har bra guidning. Lätt att använda även om du är nybörjare.\"\n - Göteborgs-Posten, Teknik & Trender, 21 feb 2014\n\nInnehåll\nAppen ger dig möjlighet att öva mindfulness med hjälp av guidning eller ledd tystnad. \nFörutom övningar innehåller appen även korta fakta om mindfulness och effekter av meditationsträningen. Du hittar även råd vid träning samt tips om sitt- och liggställningen, som är särskilt viktiga att tänka på.\nUtöver detta finns en praktisk övningsdel och en beskrivande text till varje övning. \n\n\nÖvningar \nÖvningsdelen består av följande guidade meditationer:\n1. Närvarande i kroppen10 min          \n2. Närvarande i andning             8 min          \n3.1 Kort mindfulnessmeditation 16 min\n3.2 Lång mindfulnessmeditation         21 min\n4. Kroppskanning                               24 min         \n5. Tyst andningsmeditation               15-45 min          \n6. Tystnad med klockor                  valfri längd\n\nDet finns olika inställningar som Du kan välja bland.\n•Du kan välja klockor före och efter meditationsövningen\n•Vill du bli väckt efter övningen kan du ställa in detta\n•Du kan välja att sitta upp eller ligga ner\n•I övning 5 finns det stödord, som påminnelseord, som hjälper dig att hålla dig vaken under tystnad\n•Övning 6 är Tystnad med enbart klockor\n•Du väljer själv intervall på stödorden och klockorna i övning 5 och 6 samt hur länge du vill sitta\n\nBakgrund\nMindfulness eller medveten närvaro kan beskrivas som ett tillstånd där vi har vår uppmärksamhet och vårt medvetande riktat just i den situation vi befinner oss i för ögonblicket. Det är ett förhållningssätt till livet. Buddhistmunken Thich Nhat Hanh skriver att vi kan lära oss att förnimma friden som finns runt omkring oss och inom oss genom meditationsträning. ”Det är inte en fråga om tro utan om övning.”\n\n\nDu bör inte lyssna på övningarna när du kör bil eller när du behöver vara alert.\n\nAppen Mindfulness är framtagen av Specialistsjukgymnast Helena Löwen-Åberg tillsammans med Develant Technologies AB. Helena bedriver egen mottagning i Göteborg och har lång erfarenhet av kliniskt arbete med patienter som har stressrelaterade besvär, tinnitus, oro, ångest, långvarig smärta, yrsel och sömnsvårigheter. \nFörutom appen Mindfulness finns även appen Tinnitushjälp som särskild hjälp för dig med Tinnitus-besvär.\n\nTeam\nHelena Löwen-Åberg:Övningsproducent, manus, röst\nJohan Sanneblad:Projektledning teknik och grafik, iPhone-utveckling\nPontus Backlund:Android-utveckling\nFredrik Löf:Projektstyrning"

I was worried that it might be difficult to use, but I found it incredibly easy and I was running with a program that only took me about five minutes to program, and that included recording the voice prompts.\"\n- by Laura Moncur, starling-fitness.com\n\n-----------------------------------\n- Description -\n\nUltraTimer is the original fully-programmable and customizable interval timer in the AppStore. As a result, it is the most refined and feature-rich interval timer today! \n\nUltraTimer is an easy and convenient way of timing any activity or series of activities. You can set a single timer or multiple timers, each including series of count-down intervals that run back-to-back. Each interval can be customized to play a different alarm sound from the included library, as well as change the background color for visual feedback. \n\nIt is easy to set up intervals for any activity: training (martial arts, boxing, mma, circuit training, interval training, Crossfit, HIIT / HIT, yoga, meditation, exercise, workout, cycling, running, etc), time management for switching between multiple projects, or anything else you can think of. \n\nFor a complete workout, you can set up a Timer Group which will play individual timers back to back. Start out with your favorite Warm Up timer,  then run through your favorite Training timer, and end with a Stretching timer. UltraTrainer will run you through your full workout automatically.\n\nThe included sound library comes with a wide variety of reminder sounds suitable for relaxing timers, high intensity activities, and everything in between. Custom sounds can also be recorded via the microphone; you are not limited to the included sound library.\n\nExclusive to our products, users can browse the Timer Exchange, a community where people freely exchange timers. Search, browse, and download timers that other users have uploaded. If you want, you can upload your own timers to share with others.\n\nIf a friend also owns UltraTimer, you can exchange timers via e-mail or the clipboard to use other methods.\n\nUsing UltraTimer with music playing is not a problem. You can begin playing music on the timer screen, pause it, or skip to the next track.\n\nJust a few features in UltraTimer:\n- Timer Exchange community\n- Runs in the background\n- Copy/Paste Intervals and Actions\n- Delayed start time\n- Over 70 included sounds\n- Record your own sounds\n- Large countdown timer display\n- iPod music playback control lets you pause/play the current track or move to the next track from the countdown timer screen\n- Pause the timer to temporarily halt the activity\n- Timer state is saved if it is interrupted\n- Still runs if screen is locked\n- Intuitive setup\n\nIf you're looking for an App that coaches you as you train, check out \"UltraTrainer.\""

The app has three sections:\n\nOffice, conference & sofa\n\nCar, bus & train\n\nIn the air\n\nEach section begins with exercises to improve circulation, it then moves on to strengthen muscles in legs, buttocks, abdomen, back, shoulders, arms and neck. It ends with stretching. Clear illustrations accompany each exercise. A reminder signal can be activated."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

Apparna är utvecklade tillsammans med Susnet.\n\nSAGT OM TRÄNA PÅ 17 MINUTER\n“Jag har dvd \"träna på 17 minuter\" och jag måste  säga att den är fantastisk! Den är snabb, effektiv och rolig. Jag tränar till den flera gånger i veckan och det känns som om jag får ut det mesta möjliga på den tiden jag tränar.”\n/Julia\n\n“Jag är professionell dansare i Göteborg. För att hålla mig i gång under semestrar upptäckte jag dina \"mag och rygg\" dvd och \"ben och rumpa\", det är de första dvd som verkligen är BRA och som ger mig mycket att jobba med, även om jag är vältränad.”\n/Janni\n\n“Får sällan träningsvärk i magen annars, jag tror att mycket av hemligheten i\n17-minuter mage & rygg ligger i att rörelserna utförs så pass sakta att det inte går att fuska genom att hjälpa till med andra muskler än just mage/rygg.”\n/Ulrika\n\nKOST & TRÄNING\nEn sats träning och en gnutta kosttänk och du kan komma i vilken form som helst. Oavsett om du äter enligt GI, LCHF, ISO eller LCHQ så är det viktigt att äta näringsrik kost i samband med träning för att få den rätta energin."

      "label": "Mood Mint combines a variety of psychological techniques to help boost your mood, and reduce stress, anxiety and depression.\n\nThere are 4 main components to Mood Mint (all backed by hard science):\n\n1) COGNITIVE BIAS MODIFICATION\nAttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is a computer-based therapy that gets the user to repeatedly select positive information over negative information. The aim of the game is to tap the positive image as quickly as possible. In this way, CBM helps train your brain to automatically focus more on positive information in your everyday life.The result: less stress and a happier you. \n\nStudies show that Bias Modification can effectively lower anxiety with as little as 2 hours of treatment. A number of studies have shown that CBM can also help to alleviate depression. After several weeks of CBM, participants showed increased activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex – the area of the brain associated with more positive, happier thinking.\n\nMood Mint allows you to fully customize the Cognitive Bias Modification game – edit, delete, or add your own images for a personalized CBM experience. Add pictures of things you are grateful for, happy events and people that are special to you and give them a positive charge. These will also help to trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals during each training session.\n\n\nIf you would like to find out more about Atttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (ACBM), and how it is being used to treat anxiety and depression,  please visit BiasModification.com\n\n\n2) HAPPY NOTES\nSlides will appear during the cognitive bias modification session. These are loaded with bite-sized mental health tips, facts, stats, techniques and exercises to help boost your mood.  You can take your time reading the slides and carrying out the exercises as the timer will stop while they are on screen. \n\nAll of the 'Happy Notes' are based on leading research and theory in psychology and neuroscience fields. Each and every one of them can help to lower stress and anxiety, and improve overall mental health and wellbeing. \n\nGo to Settings to edit and add your own happy notes to the program.\n\n3) POSITIVE WORD SEARCH\nJust as focusing your attention on negative or threatening information can trigger the release of stress chemicals like cortisol and adrenaline, so focusing on positive information can trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals like serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.\n\nResearch in the fields of psychology and neuroscience  have shown that our brains automatically releases feel-good neurochemicals whenever we focus on a positive word.\n\nThe word search is designed to trigger these ‘feel-good’ chemicals by getting you to focus on positive words. You need to find all 4 of the words listed below the letter grid to complete the word search. Drag your finger over the letters in the grid to highlight each of the words listed.\n\nTo maximise the positive psychological effect, try to think of all the positive things you associate with each word as you search for it.\n\n4) BREATHING EXERCISE\nThere is a guided breathing exercise at the end of each training session. Focusing on your breathing helps to ground you in the present, and triggers the parasympathetic (‘rest and digest’) response, helping you to instantly  feel  a little calmer. Focused breathing is an important element of mindful meditation, and it comes with a long list of mental health benefits.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that focused breathing meditation alone can help to lower stress, reduce anxiety and depression.\n\nHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN?\nThe short answer – as often as you need to. For optimal results, you should aim to train for around 5 to 10 minutes per day,  and anytime in between if you're feeling stressed, anxious or upset.\n\nTo complete the program, you need to earn 10 000 points."

      "label": "Träna snabbt enkelt och effektivt! Hinn med träningen på 17 minuter. 17 effektiva minuter. En perfekt lösning de dagar du känner att du vill träna men egentligen inte har tid. Eller använd styrketräningsövningarna som en avslutning på konditionspasset.\n\nApparna 17 minuter finns i tre versioner: 17 minuter Mage & Rygg, 17 minuter Ben & Rumpa samt 17 minuter Hela Kroppen.\n\nTräna på 17 minuter Hela Kroppen innehåller effektiva övningar som tränas utan redskap och som är lätta att genomföra. Träna 17 minuter Hela Kroppen 2-3 gånger i veckan för bästa resultat.\n\nTräna programmet som det är eller efter en powerwalk, löparrunda eller ett gruppträningspass.\n\nDet går också bra att kombinera apparna 17 minuter med varandra för att skapa ett längre träningspass. Kombinera dem hur du vill.\n\nTräna efter din egen förmåga - träningen i 17 minuter passar alla, oavsett träningsvana. Har du inte tränat på ett tag så är det bara att välja kom-i-gång-alternativen för varje övning. Eller träna varannan repetition. Sedan kan du successivt öka både intensitet och antalet repetitioner.\n\nÄr du supervältränad? Satsa på att köra de tuffaste övningsalternativen!\n\nTips - använd hörlurar så hör du instruktionerna direkt i öronen, efter ett par gånger kan du träna på utan att behöva titta på skärmen så mycket och ha telefonen i fickan.\n\nProva också att ställa den på ett bord eller liknande, så att du ser bra. Det går också bra att hålla i telefonen.\n\nTRÄNA SÅ HÄR:\nPå med funktionella träningskläder och skor. Använd gärna en träningsmatta som underlag, eller en dubbelvikt badhandduk.\n\nTräna på valfri plats i ditt eget tempo. Satsa på att lära tekniken först, sedan kommer styrkan snabbare än du tror.\n\nTräning är som allt annat, enkelt och roligt när man väl lärt sig. Första gången du tränar 17 minuter Hela Kroppen - fokusera på tekniken. Känn efter hur och var övningarna tar. När du lärt dig övningarna - kör hela programmet, tryck på pausknappen om du känner att du behöver vila lite under passet.\n\nSätt mål och delmål. Ta det lugnt i början och låt träningen vara något roligt, inget “måste”.\n\nTa ett steg i taget och var glad och stolt över de repetitioner du klarar. Satsa på att göra en extra repetition varje gång du tränar så utvecklar du din styrka och form.\n\nOM TRÄNA PÅ 17 MINUTER\nCaroline Nilsson är instruktören bakom Träna på 17 minuter. Hon har tillsammans med Susanne Jarl och Susnet också utvecklat de internationella träningsapparna Poworkout Trim & Tone samt Poworkout Ball & Band.\n\nCaroline Nilsson kör även personlig träning på nätet via personligträningonline.se och driver träningssajten GymGlam.se.\n\nKonceptet 17 minuter finns också som tre träningsdvder och producerades i samarbete med Swedebeat. Apparna är utvecklade tillsammans med Susnet.\n\nSAGT OM TRÄNA PÅ 17 MINUTER\n“Jag har dvd \"träna på 17 minuter\" och jag måste  säga att den är fantastisk! Den är snabb, effektiv och rolig. Jag tränar till den flera gånger i veckan och det känns som om jag får ut det mesta möjliga på den tiden jag tränar.”\n/Julia\n\n“Jag är professionell dansare i Göteborg. För att hålla mig i gång under semestrar upptäckte jag dina \"mag och rygg\" dvd och \"ben och rumpa\", det är de första dvd som verkligen är BRA och som ger mig mycket att jobba med, även om jag är vältränad.”\n/Janni\n\n“Får sällan träningsvärk i magen annars, jag tror att mycket av hemligheten i\n17-minuter mage & rygg ligger i att rörelserna utförs så pass sakta att det inte går att fuska genom att hjälpa till med andra muskler än just mage/rygg.”\n/Ulrika\n\nKOST & TRÄNING\nEn sats träning och en gnutta kosttänk och du kan komma i vilken form som helst. Oavsett om du äter enligt GI, LCHF, ISO eller LCHQ så är det viktigt att äta näringsrik kost i samband med träning för att få den rätta energin."

Följ det strukturerade åttaveckorsprogrammet eller gör övningarna utifrån ditt eget dagsbehov.\n\nI Oas-programmet finns de tre grundläggande mindfulnessövningarna:\n* Kroppsscanning, för att slappna av, somna eller sova bättre.\n* Enkla yogarörelser, som tänjer på kroppens och sinnets gränser.\n* Sittande meditation, för ökad koncentration och närvaro.\nDen korta övningen Andrum är för många en välkommen oas i vardagen.\n\nÖvningarna som ingår i denna app är:\n1. Andrum 3:41\n2. Yogarörelser 20:19\n3. Kroppsscanning 20:23\n4. Sittande meditation 15:13\n5. Tystnad med klockor (valfri tidslängd)\n\nMinnesregeln OAS ger stöd i vardagen:\nObservera => Acceptera => Svara med handling eller Släpp taget\n\nMed appen följer korta och pedagogiska texter som beskriver programmet vecka för vecka. Yogaövningarna och de olika sittpositionerna illustreras med fotografier. \n\nMed applikationen kan du:\n* Lyssna på övningar direkt i din telefon.\n* Skapa påminnelser som hjälper dig att komma ihåg övningarna.\n* Föra en loggbok med kommentarer över de övningar du gör.\n\nOas – ett mindfulnessprogram är framtaget och inspelat av Johan Bergstad, leg. psykolog, författare till Mindfulness steg för steg och utbildad mindfulnessinstruktör (se www.MindfulnessNow.se). Cd-versionen av träningsprogrammet har fått stort genomslag i Sverige.\n\nSagt om cd-versionen av Oas – ett mindfulnessprogram:\n»Jättebra verktyg att ta till hjälp för att stressa av och öka det egna välbefinnandet.«\n»En ny grund att stå på.«\n»Lätt att följa, behaglig röst.«\n»Tydliga instruktioner både på CD och i häfte.«\n»OAS är en livsstil för mig.«\n»Bra stöd, varierande övningar för olika tillfällen och situationer.«\n»Detta kommer jag att bära med mig så länge jag andas.«\n\nAndra appar av Johan Bergstad:\nDagliga droppar mindfulness\nMindfulness steg för steg\nMindfulness – Lugn och lycklig\nMindfulnessklockan"

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected. No account setup required. - \n\nYour sleep recording never leaves your iPhone. Once analysed, it is deleted. \n\nYour age, gender, sleep duration and risk assessment will be collected by ResApp Health and used to improve our products and services. This will not include any data that will identify you. To find out more, please read our privacy policy.\n\nFor use on adults aged 18 years and above.\n\nAlways read and follow the Instructions before Use. If you are unsure, check with your doctor.\n\nSleepCheck is CE marked and TGA approved for ARTG listing as a Class I mobile medical device."

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "MRIcontrast™ is a truly interactive simulator for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The app is aimed at healthcare professionals working with MRI, who want to learn how scan parameters affect the MR image.\n\nMRIcontrast™ visualizes realistic MRI images from various body parts and allows the user to change scan parameters (repetition time, echo time, flip angle, and many others). Also the magnetic field strength can be altered (1.5T or 3T). Any parameter change results in an immediate, real-time update of the MR image.\n\nTo facilitate for MRI-beginners, a built-in tutorial explains the meaning of each parameter and how it will affect the MR image. All imaging protocols are explained in detail, and guides are provided of how to learn and explore the various phenomena that can be studied.\n\nMRIcontrast™ is delivered with a gallery of common sequence types (T1-, T2- and PD-weighted spin echo, T2*-weighted gradient echo with and without RF-spoiling, steady-state free precession (SSFP), balanced SSFP, inversion recovery, turbo spin echo, echo planar imaging etc), from which the user can explore the effects of changing the preset parameters.\n\nIn addition to viewing the images, the sound of the scanner can be played, and it also changes depending on the scan parameter settings.\n\nImage features and MRI phenomena that currently are visualized in MRIcontrast™:\n - Contrast as function of TR, TE and flip angle\n - Signal-to-noise ratio\n - Fat/water in-phase and opposed-phase\n - Chemical shift artefact\n - Different image contrast and SNR at 3T vs. 1.5T\n - T2*-relaxation\n - Gradient echo imaging with and without RF-spoiling, including SSFP-Echo\n - Echo-planar (EPI) geometrical distortions\n - bSSFP (True FISP) banding artifacts"

Have a helper hold the device and swipe the screen in the direction you are pointing. \n2. At a distance of 3 metres to the screen, ask your helper to start the test when seated and ready. Take your time.\n3. Add a photo of the tested eye(s).\n4. Share your result with your optometrist or ophthalmologist."

      "label": "SnoreMonitor SleepLab\n\nTwo years as top paid Medical App in Sweden.\n\nGraphs every breath. Listen to snoring sound. See chest movements & sleep position! Perfect Sleep-Apnea-First-Alert! And it graphs all night in a second. Superfast! \n\nMain functions: \n1. Graph your snoring and breathing sounds. Tap the graph to listen and analyze. Repeat tapping to accelerate playback speed.\n2. Graph your chest movements – a Sleep Apnea first alert! \n3. Display your sleeping positions.\n4. Now you can mail the graph and sound to your doctor for fast checkup. \n\nThis app will help detect a snoring problem. Snoring activity is displayed in a perfect graph on which you can view the entire night or zoom in to a particular minute or second. By tapping the graph, you can hear every breath! \n\nBy viewing your chest movements and comparing them to the sound graph, you can watch for indications of Sleep Apnea. If a delay or pause in breathing is detected, this can serve as a warning to seek the advice of a doctor before a more serious problem develops. \n\nYour sleeping positions are also displayed. If the app indicates snoring while sleeping on your back, you can adjust your position accordingly, which may reduce or eliminate snoring. \n\nNew with SnoreMonitor SleepLab: Recordings can now be scheduled. You may also adjust the magnitude of the graph for perfect analysis.\n\nThis app was developed to fine-tune our adjustable snoring devices, MegaVent Nasal Dilators and ReduZnore Anti Snoring Mouthpiece. If perfect results are not achieved with these devices alone, reshape them and check your results the next morning with SnoreMonitor PRO. \n\nYou can also check the performance of your current snoring devices! Does your dentist-made snoring mouthpiece really work? How much do you spend on snoring spray? Put it to the test! Do you sleep alone? This app is perfect for those who suspect they may snore. \n\nBy putting an end to snoring now, you may avoid damage caused by snoring vibrations. Damage may cause soft tissues to become weak enough to block the airway and snoring can also lead to obstructive Sleep Apnea, high blood pressure, and heart problems. \n\nWhile our app is useful on its own, it is also a component of our total snoring solution package. We want to provide you with the solution to stop your snoring once and for all. \n\nOur snoring devices can be delivered worldwide. They serve as an inexpensive solution recommended by dentists, ENT doctors, and many hospitals in Sweden. Our products are natural, drug-free, and they put an end to snoring by widening narrowed airways. \n\nFor more ways to reduce or eliminate snoring, please download our app! \n\nWe have listened to user comments from our first app and have worked hard to develop a new and improved SnoreMonitor SleepLab.\n\nIf you are a current user, we strongly suggest upgrading to this faster, more efficient version.  \n\nMany thanks for downloading our app and telling your friends. And please, if you like this new version - please rate us...It helps you to get our next version faster!\n\niPad users: To record sleeping positions and chest movements, the device needs to be attached to your chest. As this may result in damage to your iPad, please consider downloading this app just to record snoring patterns. Recordings can help reduce or eliminate snoring and you will still receive 4 free samples of MegaVent, our adjustable breathing aid."

      "label": "Behaviour of concern is an app designed to keep track of the levels of arousal at different times of the day in order to be able to draw conclusions about the behavioural patterns of violent outbursts and conflicts. The app was developed in collaboration with psychologists who have long experience of using the low arousal approach and working with persons displaying behaviours of concern.\n \nThe Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommends the low arousal approach in the treatment of people with inadequate affect regulation, in order to, in the moment, prevent or reduce behaviours of concern. This may involve, for example, people with autism spectrum disorders and ADHD. It can also involve children who are developing, and in their attempts towards independence have difficulties with affect regulation.\n \nThe app can be used by professionals or parents who need help to see patterns in everyday life and by doing that try to create changes that reduce unwanted behaviours and increase positive interactions.\n \nThis is a tool that facilitates tracking of severe behaviours of concern and outbursts that disrupt daily life. Warning behaviours, which are a bit lower in their level of arousal, but still signal that everything is not going smooth, may also be tracked using the app. After a period of use, it will be possible to see if there are days or times of the day where outbreaks and chaos are recurring. If you make changes in everyday routines or in response to a conflict situation, you can, after some time, find out if the changes have had an effect on the amount of outbursts.\n \nBy using the tool, working proactively and managing behaviours of concern using the low arousal approach, we can avoid serious conflicts and dangerous restraints. The low arousal approach is a method that protects the right of children and functionally-challenged individuals not to be subjected to practices that are dangerous or that can be perceived as offensive.\n \nIf you want to learn more about how to understand and deal with behaviours of concern, you can read the literature by among others, psychologist Bo Hejlskov Elvén, about the low arousal approach and behaviour of concern.\n \nThe founders of the website \"Pedagogiskt kapital\", Daniel Elvén and Carita-Li Smyth, together with other psychologists, want to provide different perspectives on how we can solve problems in a way that increases people's experience of participation and security.\n\nIMPORTANT: Handle collected data with care since it can contain personal information."

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

The App was developed by experts and ensures that you exercise correctly.  \n\nUse the App as a motivation for making pelvic floor exercises an integral part of your daily life. It is your tool to have at hand at all times. Now, you can squeeze correctly – anytime and anywhere. \n\nWhy are pelvic floor exercises so important?\nPregnancy and birth strain the pelvic floor muscles that can also slacken with advancing age. Pelvic floor exercises are important, in order for you to rediscover your body and be able to do all the activities you were used to doing before getting pregnant. Many women experience difficulties holding in urine after giving birth, for example while running, jumping on a trampoline or when laughing, sneezing or coughing. It is scientifically proven that pelvic floor exercises have a significant effect on incontinence, both before, during and after pregnancy. But as with any training, it’s all about getting started as soon as possible and training both properly and regularly.  \n\nFunctions:\n\nThe app has several functions that ensure successful pelvic floor training. \n- Reminders\n- Photos\n- Videos with exercises \n- Sound files\n- ’My downloads’:Your downloaded videos and sound files, which you can also use offline.\n\nThe exercises are divided into three levels, ensuring that everyone can participate regardless of the individual level. \n1. Beginner\n2. Slightly experienced\n3. Very experienced\n\nDeveloped by experts\nThe App is developed by physiotherapist Ulla Due in cooperation with midwife PhD Sara Kindberg from GynZone."

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor.

Cortisone injections are without a doubt the most effective treatment for localized inflammatory pain. They are less expensive and have fewer side effects than NSAIDs.\n\nGood knowledge of anatomy, physiology and good technique are necessary prerequisites, but the execution is more of an art, thus the name “Artofinjection”.\n \nThis app contains 18 different techniques, comprehensively presented through both 3D-pictures and video. All the injections shown are done on real patients from my own daily practice. For each technique a recommendation for syringe, needle and mixture is provided. The theory section provides concentrated information on how to become a more skilled doctor, providing your patients with a safe, well-documented and effective treatment option – the cortisone injection!\n\nRoger Stadra M.D.\nSweden/Thailand\nCreator & Author"

Start training today!\n\n“Doing the exercises meant that I got started in doing something about my situation – whereas at the hospital I was given no information that you could train paralysed muscles!”\nPär, 35\n\nPeripheral facial paralysis - Bell's palsy,  strikes suddenly but the symptoms may develop gradually: many sufferers just wake up with one side of their face paralysed. The cause is often unknown. \n\nThe purpose of  this  app - Face It! Bell´s Palsy-Training™-  is to provide information about Bell's palsy and how you can get started with your own training. \nTo establish that you do have Bell's palsy, you must be examined by a qualified medical practitioner. You can then contact a physiotherapist for treatment/training advice and this app can be a very effective aid in your training.\n\nThe app contains questions and answers about Bell's palsy, some background on how to do the training, and specific exercises related to the muscles that have been weakened.\nUsing willpower to guide your movements is important. This neuromuscular training is based on PNF - Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation.  This method stimulates the muscles to respond better and more effectively.\nWith the help of this app, you can retain proprioception of the movements of your face, get your muscles working, and above all, do something yourself about your situation.\n\nThe Face It! app is based on long experience in the treatment of Bell's palsy and research that shows it is never too late to start training!  If you forget to train for a while, you can always go back to it!\n\nFace It! was produced by Susanne Hedin, B.Sc.*, Registered Physiotherapist/Ergonomist and IPNFA** Senior Instructor. She is very experienced in the treatment of Bell's palsy and has also conducted scientific studies of the training.\n\nThe content has been reviewed by:\nHasse Ejnell, MD., Ph.D., Consultant, Dept. of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden (Introduction and the Facts).\nKristin Stjerna, B.Sc., Registered Physiotherapist, IPNFA Advanced Instructor, Haute école de Santé (Heds), Geneva, Switzerland (PNF training programme and Tips). \n\n * Bachelor of Science\n** International PNF Association\n\nwww.ergonomhuset.se\nOur knowledge : Your health"

It can happen to any of us but now with The Pill iPhone App, it may never happen again. \n\nThe Pill will remind you to take your birth control pill every day at a time you choose, with a local notification alert (similar to an SMS). The application does not need to be running in order to receive the alert. Works also in plane mode.\n \nWhy not set yourself an alarm on your mobile? \nThe Pill iPhone app is much more than a simple alarm. \n\nThe Pill automatically calculates the 7 days stop period, and the 21 days when you are actually taking the pill. If you are using a 28 day pack then alerts will be sent to you every day. Alerts will not be sent during the 7 days stop period, they only occur during the 21 days when you are actually taking your pill. \n\nYou can see exactly when you have to take your pill, compare your real package with the one in the actual application and see if you have missed a pill or not. \n\nOther features include:  \n\n- Customizable alert sound and background color\n- Alerts received via email\n- Extra alert request option \n\nThe female contraceptive pill is the most popular method of contraception, with 38% of women currently taking it. However, the Pill needs to be used consistently and correctly in order to be effective.  Some types of contraceptive pill have to be taken at exactly the same time every day.  This is why this iPhone app, The Pill, is so important to help prevent unwanted or unplanned pregnancies. \n \nAdvice: take your pill in the morning, if ever you forget to take it, you still can remember it during the day, it won't be too late (after getting asleep, you increase the risk to be more than 12 (or 3) hours late). \n\n-----\nterms & conditions\n\nIn order to receive the notification, you must allow the notifications (settings menu on your iphone) and be connected on internet. WiFi connection may cause problems with notifications especially if the iPhone is in sleep mode, we advice to stay connected with 3G. The Pill also work without internet be you need to let the application running to hear the alarm.\n\nWe cannot be held liable for any breakdowns or faults on our application. Receiving the push notification is not 100% guaranteed even if we do our best to make it work all the time."

The topics include 167 bones and landmarks, 138 muscles, and 111 organ images.  Turn on the timer option for an extra challenge!\n  Try this unique anatomy quiz game and you'll be happy you did!\n\nA quick anatomy lesson: this app features ALL the bones and many landmarks, but in the bone section, there are only 53 bones listed.... aren't there 206 bones in the body?  Most of the bones are bilateral... one on each side, so we don't quiz the right femur and left femur, this cuts the list down almost in half. Many bones are repeat... 12 ribs on each side, 10 distal phalanges, 10 proximal phalanges... When we take out all these repetitive bones, we are left with about 53 unique bones.... so please know that this app has been designed by experienced intelligent anatomists!"

      "label": "* The world's number 1 DAF app is used by thousands of people in over one hundred countries. *\n\nDAF Professional has been created to help people who stammer or have a neurological disease such as Parkinson's Disease. It helps people to slow their rate of speech which makes it clearer to others.\n\nDAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.\n\nDAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT). DAF Professional delivers incredibly low latency feedback even when running in the background.\n\nDelayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly. However, until recently, devices have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used.\n\nDAF was originally developed for people who stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010).\n\nIt works by enabling someone to hear his or her own speech in an altered manner. This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups however DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions.\n\nWhen using Bluetooth devices there is an additional delay of 60ms added to the feedback system.\n\nIf you do use a Bluetooth headset you may find you need to turn the bluetooth device on after opening the app to enable it.\n\nDAF Professional works when put in the background or the screen is turned off. Like all apps of this type, it can NOT work during phone calls or with other media apps playing at the same time.\n\nIf you wish to provide any feedback we would be delighted to hear from you.

      "label": "Managing meals as a diabetic can be hard and frustrating at times. No longer, if you can make use of a proper meal planner.\n\nThis app simplifies food management and allows diabetics to break free of boring routines. Make cooking and trying out new foods exciting again and rediscover the joy in eating out.\n\n\n≡ WHY COUNT CARBS ? ≡\n\nEspecially new, unknown products and their effects on blood sugar levels are often hard to assess and so we all fall into this dull habit of eating the same things - day in, day out. \nCounting carbohydrates is a good solution for many people with diabetes, not just those taking insulin. The International Diabetes Association recommends \"carb counting as an [effective] meal planning technique for managing blood glucose levels\". \n\n\n≡ WHAT DOES IT DO? ≡\n\nThis app was specifically designed for diabetics (type 1 & type 2) and aims to make the whole process easy and simple to use:\n\n• identify carbohydrates in different foods\n• calculate the amount of carbohydrates these foods contain for your serving size / meals\n• start looking at how much insulin to take for the amount of carbohydrates consumed\n\nThe database contains carbohydrate values for thousands of popular foods. Simply set your serving size with the swipe of your finger and add calorie information if you struggle with the weight management part. The calculations necessary for a complete meal are automated and will offer you more flexibility, greater control and freedom of lifestyle. \n\n\n≡ SIMPLE INSULIN MGMT. ≡\n\nIf you take insulin, you can set 1 CU to your preferred “insulin to carbohydrate unit ratio”.\nFor the future, you will know exactly how many shots you will need with each carb unit you consume.\n\nIt is possible to adjust the app from 5 grams to 18 grams of carbohydrates per carb unit (CU) and the app will do all the necessary calculations for you!\n\n\n≡ BENEFITS OF CARB UNITS ≡\n\nOnce you learn how to count carb units, you’ll find it easy to fit a much larger variety of foods into your meal plan. This app will open up options you never knew you had!\n\nTraditionally, diabetics count the total amount of carbohydrates in their food which is difficult to keep track of and makes products hard to compare.\nIf you count carb units instead, very different types of food will become easy to compare - regardless of their weight / serving sizes. So knowing two products have 1 CU (carb unit) is ideal for making quick decisions on what is recommendable to eat.\n\nExample:\n160 g of fresh strawberries and 25 g of french fries from a large fast food company (roughly half the size of a small portion) contain the exact same amount of carbohydrates and therefore 1 carb unit (CU).\n\nSo having a CU table is also great for food comparison and product substitution.\n\n\n\n≡ APP FEATURES ≡\n=> Carb units & calories for thousands of food choices\n=> Adjustable carb unit calculations (5g – 18g of carbohydrates per CU)\n=> Quick, paperless solution to search and find the right foods\n=> Simple serving size calculator for improved accuracy\n=> Save personal serving sizes for later\n=> Save regional foods & personal favorites \n=> Create & sort lists by nutrient, ascending or descending\n=> Nutrient filter to optimize your meal planning\n=> VoiceOver support if you suffer from diabetic retinopathy"

      "label": "Do you snore at night and your partner complains about it? Are you sick to death of snoring of your partner?\n\nSnore Control can be the right solution for you. This application records your talk or snoring while you are asleep, creates the graph of noise in room during the night, takes the total time of snoring down and moreover it can try to stop your snoring.\n\nSnoring detection is based on artificial intelligence (A.I.) with the support of a new Apple machine learning technology. By using a large number of snoring samples, we can achieve high accuracy in statistics and in snoring detection itself.\n\nHow it works:\nMobile microphone is used to monitor and optionally record the noise in surroundings. By using intelligent noise analysis the application detects the snoring, makes the statistics or else activates the stop snoring function (at least two snores one after another) - it quiets you down using a sound or vibration (only iPhone). How to place your device correctly is shown in instructions. \nBy using the tracker data and by defining your own factors (activities/means/drugs/custom notes) it is possible to find out which facts influence your sleep positively and limit your snoring. At your disposal there are beautiful statistic charts for simple and efficient analyzing of your sleeps/nights. \n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- SNORE ANALYZER (TRACKER):\nSnoring analyzes and statistics with complete history and beautiful charts.\n\n- HIGH TECH SNORING DETECTION:\nAccurate snoring detection based on A.I.\n\n- ADJUSTABLE RECORDING SOUND SENSITIVITY:\nFor different sound conditions in your room (a quiet or loud environment).\n\n- RECORDING ONLY SNORING\n\n- FAVORITE RECORDINGS\n\n- SHARING RECORDINGS WITH YOUR FRIENDS:\nSend recordings via email, iMessage or post to Facebook.\n\n- STOP SNORING:\nPossibility of playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected. \n\n- FACTORS, WAKE UP MOOD, NOTES:\nUser can place factors (alcohol, coffee, stress etc.) to every night as well as the mood after waking up or users own notes. \n\n- ACTIVATION DELAY:\nStart monitoring after a period of time.\n\n- BACKGROUND MODE:\nMonitoring runs also in background mode.\n\n- APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION\n\n- iCLOUD SYNCHRONIZATION:\nSynchronization among your devices (optionally).\n\n- EXPORTING HISTORY TO CSV FILE\n\n- APPLE WATCH:\nPlays haptic (sound, vibration) if snoring is detected.\nIf you buy SMART ALARMS then it will track your sleep movements and it can play haptic (sound, vibration) if alarm is set.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:\n* It is recommended to connect your iPhone (iPad) to a charger.\n* Set \"Airplane Mode\" or \"Do Not Disturb\" on your iPhone (iPad) for undisturbed sleep.\n* Place your iPhone (iPad) according to the instructions (see screenshots).\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\nHappy customers are our highest priority.

The videos and information are all accessed from within the app with no connection to the internet required. \n \n(*Internet access is required for links accessed from within the app and tertiary video content.)\n\nA unique system that combines live sonoanatomy via ultrasound scans, 3D animated anatomy and real time video of the performance of regional anaesthetic nerve blocks. All elements are combined and synchronised with audible narration.\n\n* Full length offline demonstrations of many regional anaesthetic techniques.\n\n* Insertion of a Pajunk E-Cath (CPNB)\n\n* A video guide to the Pajunk E-Cath, including setting up of the system, insertion and fixation.\n\n* 3D Animated anatomical models, interlinked with live ultrasound scans.\n\n* Synchronised (US and camera) nerve mapping scans.\n\n* Visualise a whole block from start to finish.\n\n* Clear narration during the procedure.\n\n* A source of tips and advice which we wished had been around when we started using ultrasound. \n\n* Easy accessed tabs for Anatomy, Procedure and Tips.\n\n* Stunning full screen diagrams.\n\n* Annotated ultrasound screen shots.\n\n* Fantastic for the novice or experienced anaesthesia provider.\n\n* Learning tool for ODP’s, ODA’s, Anaesthetic nurses, PA(A)’s, AA’s, CRNA’s and all staff working within regional anaesthesia.\n\n* Medical students can gain a better insight into regional anaesthesia.\n\nA tab system gives the user access to anatomy, procedure, tips and equipment. The anatomy tab gives an overview of anatomy related to the specific block, it includes schematic diagram’s which can be expanded to full screen. The procedures tab is a full pictorial and text guide to the performance of the specific block, including annotated ultrasound screen captures to help visualise nerves. The tips tab contains useful advice related to the selected block, also included is advice on the use of ultrasound and local anaesthetics.\n\nA must have app for both junior and senior anaesthetic staff as well as practitioners working within regional anaesthesia.\n\nThe blocks are:\n\nInterscalene & Mapping\nSupraclavicular & Mapping\nInfraclavicular\nAxillary x 2 & Mapping\nRadial Nerve & Mapping\nMedian Nerve & Mapping\nUlnar Nerve & Mapping\nTAP\nFemoral Nerve & CPNB\nSaphenous Nerve\nPopliteal Sciatic\nPECS1\nPECS2\nPECS1 and 2 combined\nSerratus anterior\n\nDedicated nerve mapping videos now make orientating yourself with anatomy even easier. Using demonstrator video interlinked with annotated live ultrasound scanning can help you to locate and track nerves and other relevant anatomy. (The nerve mapping videos will be available as online content to cut down on the size of the app, an internet connection will be required to access these.)More blocks will be added to this app, contact us to let us know what you would like to see in future updates.\n\nwww.raguru.com\n\nThis App is exactly what it says it is - it’s a guide. It doesn’t set out to replace a standard text book. It certainly isn’t a substitute for a sound knowledge of anatomy and local anaesthetic pharmacology. It’s more of a guide to the occasional blocker, a refresher to the more experienced, and a teaching aid to the trainer. \n\nWe are a busy hospital with a heavy teaching commitment. Therefore we choose to use nerve stimulation in conjunction with ultrasound as we feel it adds another layer of safety to the patient, and reassurance to the operator."

      "label": "Do you have tinnitus or “ringing in the ears”? Tinnitus HQ helps you understand and relieve your tinnitus symptoms.\n\nRecent research shows that tinnitus can be treated by listening to sounds that have been filtered to remove your specific tinnitus frequencies.*\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ, you can apply advanced filters to over 500 high-quality sounds to find relief for your symptoms.\n\nSimply apply a bandpass filter to any sound or mix to isolate frequencies in a narrow range. Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

The next time you run, take your heart rate and compare to see if you did as much work. yourPulse will give you your maximum heart rate (based on your age) and then will give you your target rates for your fitness level. Keep track of your beat. \n\nTaking your heart rate is simple with yourPulse. First find your pulse.  Push the \"Start counting pulse button\" and start to count your pulse. Push the \"Stop counting button\" when you are ready. Move the slider over to how many beats you felt. It will then give your heart rate, max rate and targets (for when exercising). Lastly if you want, enter any comments about that rate and click the \"Add to History\" button. You can then go to the history window and review your heart rate history.\n\nClick on the profile tab to enter your age, and fitness level. This will customize your heart rate max and targets.\n\nIf you want to know more about how to find your pulse, click on the \"How to\" tab for instructions on how to read your pulse.\nThis app integrates with the Health app via HealthKit to save your pulse to Health App.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any feedback (web@lajdesignsw.com).

A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

It’s very easy to use and has room for notes if you want to add them. It’s much better than the basic sheet I was given by the nurse and shows up plainly how effective the meds are.

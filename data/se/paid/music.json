      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

      "label": "hearEQ builds your EQ skills to professional levels using custom ear training exercises, created just for you from your favorite songs. Simple, powerful, and fast, hearEQ is perfect for ear training on the go. Named one of \"The best iPhone and iPad apps for musicians\" (www.apppicker.com), here's what the experts have to say about hearEQ:\n\n\"When I found hearEQ, I knew this was a game-changer. From the ease of use and the ability to use your own music selections, hearEQ is perfectly designed to be the go-to choice for developing your ear. My students have shown tremendous improvements in mixing and productions, and I completely attribute this to hearEQ. Thanks Ten Kettles! Keep up the great work. You are making a difference!\" -Chandler Bridges, Ph.D., Professor (The Los Angeles Film School); Audio engineer (Will Smith, Aaliyah, Johnny Mathis, P-Diddy, J-Lo, Bette Midler, LeAnn Rimes, and more) with two Grammy-winning albums.\n\n“After half an hour with the app I had a noticeable improvement to my score, but I was also thinking in much clearer terms too!” -Tim Webb, www.discchord.com\n\n“This handy app is one of the greatest tools I've seen for helping you hear exactly how EQ adjustments affect your sound. Wish I would have had this when I was first learning how to mix live sound.” -James Wasem, www.greatchurchsound.com\n\n\"hearEQ…makes the experience of ear training enjoyable enough to seem like fun.  [It's] a great educational tool.\" -Tom Flint, Sound on Sound: The World's Best Recording Technology Magazine\n\n“The principle behind hearEQ is beautifully straightforward…even with a little repetition, things do start to improve and I suspect if you were to build some hearEQ into your daily musical routine, you would soon reap some positive benefits.” -John Walden, www.musicappblog.com\n\n----------------------------------\n\nEvery frequency range has a color, a quality, a character. For sound engineers, musicians, and other enthusiasts, knowing how to apply this to an equalizer (EQ) can make a transformational change to your sound—whether you're mixing a live concert, a recording, or even playing music through iTunes.  (VIDEO @ www.hearEQ.com)\n\nIt's a simple app with a powerful promise:  if you learn the qualities of each frequency band—for example, cutting 4kHz puts sound in the background—then you can make equalization work for you, and truly transform your sound into something professional and beautiful. \n\nhearEQ uses your favorite songs on your device to create custom ear training exercises that a) teach you all about frequency bands, and b) help you really hone your EQ skills. A standard 10-band or 30-band* equalizer is used, just like you'd find in iTunes and on many professional sound mixers. Your song will be played back with a simple equalization applied—and you guess what it was! \n\n> Was it really clear, maybe a bit hollow? Could be a 1000 Hz cut. \n\n> Was it muddy? Maybe that's a 500 Hz boost. \n\n> Was it really present, almost too in-your-face? Sounds like a 4kHz boost. \n\nTen questions, ten frequencies, and then you get a score. Want to focus on just a few frequency bands to start? You can do that too. Keep at it, and you'll be an EQ master in no time.\n\nWant to learn more? Check out our site and the hearEQ video at www.hearEQ.com.\n\n\n*The 30-band equalizer is part of the \"Advanced EQ\" module, available as an in-app purchase within hearEQ.\n\nNOTE:  hearEQ works with any track on your device, with the exception of tracks that prevent our EQ processing, such as DRM-protected tracks and cloud tracks (e.g., Apple Music). That said, hearEQ ships with several built-in practice tracks, so you'll be able to start EQing right away!\n\nTERMS OF USE:  https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

      "label": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis"

      "label": "With SonoSequencr you can create individual sequences to perform recurring tasks with just one click.\n\nIf you have multiple Sonos devices and want to play a radio station on all of them, it takes some time to set this up. With SonoSequencr, all you have to do is open the app and tap your previously created sequence.\nYou can lock your iOS device or use another app while your sequence is running in the background.\nOf course, you can also start it from the widget, Apple Watch or using Flic Buttons.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Group kitchen and dining room, set volume to 5, start a radio station and set a sleep timer to 2 hours\n- Switch your Playbar in the living room to the TV input, set the volume to 40, add dining room and set the equalizer settings for both devices to neutral\n- Disable the subwoofer and enable voice enhancement + night mode on the Playbar in the living room\n- Set the equalizer settings for all your devices to specific values\n- Disable touch on speaker and enable status light for all your devices\n- Set the volume of the kitchen and living room to the same value as in the dining room\n- Make an announcement with your individual text in the children's room\n- etc...\n\nEach of these examples, created once, requires only one tap in the widget or on your Apple Watch.\n\nSonoSequencr also includes a restricted mode. This allows you to restrict control to specific devices, among other things.\n\n\nUsing an optional in-app purchase, you can also start sequences at specific times or via external triggers like IFTTT. Of course, this requires that the iOS device is on the same network as your Sonos devices at the time. For intensive use of external triggers, it is recommended to run SonoSequencr in 'server mode'. In this mode, SonoSequencr is always running in the foreground on a dedicated iOS device. SonoSequencr still supports iOS9.\n\nThere are many more features like grid view, create dynamic alarms, HTTP requests, launch other apps, automatic battery charging in server mode, transfer sequences between devices, etc....\n\nYou can only use music (radio streams/tracks/albums) for your sequences that are stored in your Sonos Favorites (My Sonos) or in your TuneIn radio stations. You can't search your entire music library in this app. Just add your most used music to my Sonos then it can be used in your sequences.\n\nThe Timed Sequences feature is only available with an optional in-app purchase 'Premium'. With this automatically renewing subscription, up to 20 sequences can be run at freely configurable times. The function is only active as long as a valid subscription exists. The costs are billed via the iTunes account. The subscription will be renewed automatically within 24 hours before expiration (same time and costs), unless it is cancelled before in 'Settings' -> 'Manage Subscriptions' or in the iTunes settings.\n\nTo use this app you must have a working Sonos system. SonoSequencr supports Sonos software 1 and 2.\n\nFor terms and conditions and privacy policy see:\nhttps://celltekk.de/sonosequencr/help/privacy\n\nThis is not an official Sonos app."

Create a new Alarm.\n2. Choose either one song or create a playlist of songs to shuffle.\n3. Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com. I may be able to fix your issue in less time than it would take to write a negative review!"

      "label": "Humanity is out of tune.\n“If one should desire to know whether a kingdom is well governed, if its morals are good or bad, the quality of its music will furnish the answer.” ~ Confucius.\n\nThe mass media is tuned to the concert pitch of A=440hz. The majority of mainstream music is in this pitch. Today's research shows that the 440 pitch might be a bit off and disharmonious with our bodies and minds. If you’re a Musician or an Audiophile or just love listening to your music this will be a tipping point for you. There is a movement in the Music World which is trying to bring the 432hz and 528Hz pitch into our lives. Why is this important? Because sound (vibration) influences the mind and body immediately. Even the slightest constant dissonance can bring one to confusion, inner chaos and staying blind to what is going on around. Think about it, when something irritates you, the only thing you can deal with is making that thing stop. But you will never address bigger problems. It is well known today that the molecular structure of water is affected by vibration, thoughts, words, ideas and of-course Music. Our human body is made of approximately 70% water. So the link is pretty immediate here.\nI’m inviting you all to listen to your beloved music through this player which you might enjoy the brighter feeling it brings, but also will conceal healing qualities for the body and mind.\nLove Light & Meditation,\n\nP.S – I strongly recommend doing your own research on this most important matter. Please don’t rely solely upon my opinion and research.\n\n“Concerning matter, we have been all wrong. What we have called matter is energy, whose vibration has been so lowered as to be perceptible to the senses. There is no matter.”\n― Albert Einstein\n\nThe app is free and for those who want to hear their music in a more refined and healthy tone opposed to the 440 Hz.\n\n**The App Won't Play Apple Music Files.\n** The app will pitch shift music that's tuned to A = 440 Hz, it will not work on music tuned to other A note references.\n\nEnjoy\n\n*****If you do not have songs on your device the app will not have anything to play.*****\n\n** If something is not working please send an email to contact@appums.com and we'll try to find a solution.\nThanks"

Or create your own sound palette by recording the sounds around you into Note’s sampler instruments using your phone’s microphone. \n\nIf you want to take your ideas further, use Ableton Cloud to send your projects to Live (version 11.2.5 or later) without leaving the app. Open your project from Live’s browser, then keep working – you can edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds from Note are exactly the same.\n\n\nBegin with a beat: \n• Choose from 56 Drum Sampler kits\n• Tap out a beat using the 16-pad grid\n• Quantize your beat to fix any loose timing\n• Nudge notes to correct mistakes\n• Add more layers of rhythm\n• Create beat repetitions with Note Repeat\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Experiment with effects \n\nStart with a melody:\n• Choose from 261 synth sounds and 36 Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Play your melody or chord progression with either the 25-pad grid or the piano roll\n• Set a key and scale to get instantly harmonic results, or leave your options open\n• Overdub more layers of harmony\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Add effects to experiment with sound design\n\nSample your environment:\n• Create your own kits by recording percussive sounds into Note’s Drum Sampler \n• Record tonal sounds to create your own Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Manipulate your samples by cutting, filtering or repitching them\n• Shape or transform your sounds with effects\n\nCapture improvisations:\n• Play something, then tap the Capture button to keep it\n• Play at the tempo that feels comfortable and Note will detect it\n• Note will recognize the length of the phrase\n• A loop is created automatically\n• Quantize it, add to it, or change the sound\n\nCreate variations:\n• Note features a grid-based Session View layout\n• Double your loops to create variation within clips\n• Duplicate your clips and create different versions of your ideas\n• Create eight tracks with up to eight clips on eight scenes\n• Try different layer combinations and song structures \n• Export your work in Session View as an audio file to listen and share"

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

Even still supporting iPod Touch 5th Gen and iPhone 4S! \n\nWatch on YouTube (http://youtu.be/rvp4QinakL0) or \nread below about\n \n- a new intuitive and concise user interface\n- less taps for common tasks\n- home automation integration\n- and current limitions (don't skip them ;) )\n\nor come over to my homepage www.sonophone.net with much more information and screenshots available.\n\nThis application is not endorsed by or associated with Sonos, Inc. (which is why it is not free)\n\n◆◆◆ a new intuitiv and concise user interface ◆◆◆\nSonoPhone is designed to leverage the latest iOS design principles:\n- Tap or drag the player on the top and you'll find the players view to select a new player and with volume controls for all players. From here you can also enter Zone Management, where you can group and ungroup players with drag and drop.\n- Tap or drag the Track infos on the bottom and you'll be at the big covers screen\n- Drag the main menu from any place to the left or right to have instant access to playlist or shortcuts\n- volume + progress popups: when changing volume or progress of a song, you get popups telling you the actual values. Stop guessing your desired values today!\n\n◆◆◆ less taps for common tasks ◆◆◆\nSonoPad tries to optimize most often used tasks to have the least taps needed. In the end you are able to navigate and control your players much more fluently.\n\n- Touch To Play: are you sick of always beeing asked what to do when you tap a track or album? SonoPhone defaults to just starting an album or song. A long press still gives you access to all options - you can also change the tap default in the settings menu. Want to build a playlist fast? Just set the default to 'always add to end' and off you go ...\n- tap an album cover image and the whole album starts to play immediately \n- aggregated search: search results are collapsed into one view, so you see immediately in what category you have the best results, without switching back and forth\n- shortcuts to most used functions: drag the main menu to the right to get shortcut buttons for artist, albums, radio and musicservices.\n- you can control the volume of every player directly from the player selection screen. No need to switch players anymore.\n\n◆◆◆ home automation integration ◆◆◆\n- you can start SonoPhone with the 'sonophone://' URL from other remote Apps. Its also possible to hand over a return URL, then a new icon is displayed to return to the automation App.\nFurther option include to select a default player or default menu, you can read more about all option on my homepage sonophone.net\n\n◆◆◆ Limitations ◆◆◆\n\n- all music services except Google Music are supported\n- no playing of music stored on iPhone yet\n- no options to set alarms or sleep settings\n- no support for discontinued WD100 dock\n\n◆◆◆ Other stuff ◆◆◆\n- Sonos is registered trademark of Sonos, Inc."

      "label": "NanoStudio 2 is a powerful music production environment for synthesis, sampling, arranging, editing and mixing. It’s the successor to the original NanoStudio, an app held in high regard by musicians for many years for its usability, quality and productivity.  \n\nNanoStudio 2 builds upon the same design principles as its predecessor and introduces a huge range of extra features.  An all-new audio engine delivers truly professional sound quality, highly optimized to handle complex projects with large numbers of instruments and effects.\n\nNanoStudio 2 hosts external Audio Unit (AUv3) instruments and audio/MIDI effects.  A library of all your AU instruments and presets is maintained so they’re tagged, searchable and just as accessible as NanoStudio’s own internal instruments.\n\nObsidian is NanoStudio’s built-in synth.  It has 3 oscillators with 32 note polyphony and 7 different synthesis methods including analogue, wavetable, FM, multi-saw and phase distortion.  It also supports samples and multisamples which may be split by note or velocity. Obsidian has 18 different filter types, including resonant analogue, super clean digital, formant, comb and waveshaping. Nearly every parameter can be modulated via the synth’s 5 envelopes, 5 LFOs and 10 configurable macro controllers, and modulation connections can be assigned with just a few taps.  300 factory patches are supplied with macros set up and ready to go.  It’s easy to create your own patches and there are many more professionally produced patches available as IAP.\n\nSlate is NanoStudio’s second built-in instrument, a sample/synthesis-based performance pad which makes it easy to tap out drum beats.  Slate comes with 500 quality factory samples ranging from multisampled acoustic drums with natural variations through to cutting-edge electronic percussion and effects. 50 factory kits are include, and it’s easy to construct your own drum kits using the factory samples or your own. Slate can also be used with samples of just about anything: vocals, guitar riffs, synth pads – you name it.\n\nThere are powerful editors for song arrangement, MIDI, automation and samples.  All share a consistent user interface so you’ll be up to speed with them and making music in no time.\n\nA fully-featured sequencer supports tempo and time signature tracks (including tempo ramps) and Ableton Link.\n\nEverything’s brought together by a mixer with unlimited tracks, track grouping and audio/MIDI sends.  Tracks may have an unlimited number of insert effects with 11 built-in effects to choose from including reverb, sidechain compressor/expander, EQ with spectrum analysis, look-ahead limiter, delay, exciter, chorus, flanger and phaser.  You can add AU audio/MIDI effects to the chain and use them just like an internal effect.\n\nThere are many mixdown options available with quality settings up to 32 bit/96kHz and support for file formats including wav, aiff, ogg and M4A.  You can mixdown track stems in a single operation or select just a region of the song - great for resampling.\n\nNanoStudio supports Audiobus and has many options for file sharing via the iOS Files app, Dropbox, AudioShare, iTunes File Sharing, AirDrop, email, WebDAV and importing music from your iTunes library.\n\nDevelop your initial musical ideas through to a final master with an intuitive workflow designed to get things done."

Use it with a ZOOM iQ　series mic, which are designed to capture audio of the best quality with iOS devices, and record using the high-fidelity linear PCM and space-saving AAC formats. This app includes normalize and divide functions that can be used on recorded files. In addition, it has compressor, EQ and reverb effects. Moreover, you can directly upload your recordings from Handy Recorder to the iCloud and SoundCloud file-sharing site, allowing you to bring your creations to the world over the Internet. \r\n\r\nFeatures \r\n■ Stereo linear PCM and AAC recording\r\n-You can record files using either high-quality linear PCM format or AAC format at a bit rate of 64, 128 or 160 kbps.\r\n-The AUTO REC function can be used to start and stop recording automatically in response to the input signal level.\r\n\r\n■ Works like a hardware recorder\r\n-The operation screen was designed to simulate a ZOOM hardware Handy Recorder, so this app is as easy to operate as these products.\r\n\r\n■ Effects \r\n-Recorded files can be processed using the included effects. \r\n•6 BAND EQ\r\n•REVERB (ROOM, JAZZ CLUB, CONCERT HALL, ARENA, STADIUM)\r\n•MASTERING (MAXIMIZE, ULTRA MAXIMIZE, CLEAR & POWER, WIDE, MONO)\r\n-Pro+C8cessed recordings can also be saved as separate files. \r\n-Use the NORMALIZE function to optimize the volume.\r\n\r\n■File editing\r\n-In addition to deleting files, you can use the divide function to split files at the point that you want. \r\n\r\n■Uploading to Cloud Services\r\n-The app includes a function that allows you to upload your recordings directly to the SoundCloud audio-sharing site. You can name your recordings and make sharing settings in the Handy Recorder app.\r\n-iCloud drive is supported. Not only uploading selected file manually, but also “Auto Sync” function allows you to upload automatically soon after REC finished.\r\n\r\n■Optimized for the iQ series\r\n-By using the iQ5/iQ7 in MS recording mode, you can adjust the stereo width. \r\n-Select from three iQ5's AUTO GAIN settings (CONCERT, SOLO, MEETING) according to the application.* \r\n-Use the DIRECT MONITOR function to monitor the input signal through the headphones jack on the iQ series without latency \r\n-The left and right channels of the iQ series input signal can be reversed.* \r\n*These setting are saved in the iQ series mic itself and will be applied when using it with other apps. \r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit our website. \r\nwww.zoomcorp.com"

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever.

SynthStation transforms your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad into a portable music production studio for mobile music creation. SynthStation gives you three powerful synthesizers for creating and modifying sonic textures used for melodies, chords, and bass lines. Built around Akai Professional’s history in synthesis and drawing on the newest MINIAK synth, SynthStation sounds great and offers wide-ranging sonic flexibility with its virtual analog synthesis.\n\nFrom the moment you start SynthStation, you'll know your way around. It is jam-packed with tools to help you create music with the convenience of your touch screen and each section works the way you work. With SynthStation, you can create and save sequences and complete songs. The app contains three different three-oscillator synths and a range of drum kits you can sequence and mix right in the SynthStation. For creating melodic and accompaniment parts, the SynthStation contains an arpeggiator with preset patterns, built-in effects and filters, and an XY touch control interface for expressive control of key parameters.\n\nPERFORM\nPlay with keys, XY and arpeggiator controls. This is perfect place to make magic happen because it gives you access to all the common controls you’ll need in a performance or creation setting.\n\nSYNTH\nComplete synthesis controls from oscillators to LFOs, envelopes, and more. You can control a wide range of filters to dial in exactly the sound you need. Choose from Sine, Triangle, Square or Sawtooth on your VCO and start creating your own signature sounds from scratch. Filter Cutoff and Resonance are just two taps away.\n\nDRUMS\nIn addition to SynthStation's three synthesizers, we've included drum kits and a visual representation of the most iconic beat making tool in the world - MPC pads. Just pick your kit and start tapping beats anywhere, anytime. Includes:\n\nDrum Kit – select the drum kit and play it with onscreen pads.\n\nDrum Edit – tune, mix, and customize your drums.\n\nSEQUENCER\nKeyboard grid – see your keyboard sequencing and edit notes easily.\n\nDrum grid – build and modify drum tracks with a visible sequencer grid.\n\nSONG/SEQUENCE\nSelect and save your Song/Sequence projects. You can recall your Songs and work on them later, and even export them for further editing in your desktop audio applications.\n\nCONTROL\nXY – two axes of control for hands-on, real-time control. Just like a joystick, the XY controller can snap back to the zero point.\n\nTempo – control tempo and even tap in the tempo you want.\n\nMIXER\nThe Mixer in SynthStation includes touch-controlled faders for each of the three synthesizers and the drum section as well as FX send for each. \n\nMixer – mix all the levels of the parts and effects. Just like a hardware mixer, there are faders, mutes, and effect routing.\n\nEffects – select and control FX type and parameters.\n\nSynthStation Studio enables you to create and produce music anywhere on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad."

You get over 40 high-quality real instruments multi-sampled exclusively for this app. Hundreds of included scales allow you to effortlessly play in any style from rock to classical, whether you are a musical novice or a seasoned professional.\n\n---====---\nJordan Rudess, the world-renowned keyboardist for Dream Theater says:\n\n\"ThumbJam stands at the very top of the overcrowded music app world. The sounds included absolutely rival those found in pro instruments and making music on the app is a total joy. The only problem I have with this app is that I did not make it myself! Luckily, I'm able to work with the developer and offer a few good feature ideas as well as some choice sounds from my personal collection!\"\n---======----\n\nEven if you've only played air guitar, ThumbJam lets you sound like a pro.  Pick an instrument and jam -- with all the scales to choose from you'll never hit a wrong note. The high quality instrument samples will make you sound like you just skipped years of music lessons.\n\nFor the performing musician, this app is awesome for soloing on an instrument you didn't bring along.  Play in any key, any style -- go from a string ensemble to a wailing guitar. ThumbJam was developed and tested by musicians to feel and sound like a real instrument. You'll be surprised at how expressive it can be, make sure to check out the videos and audio at thumbjam.com.\n\nThumbJam makes use of tilt and shake to add vibrato, tremolo, note bends, and volume swells for more realistic and expressive results. It supports up to five (eleven on iPad) simultaneous touches and up to 32 voice polyphony, for each of up to 8 loaded instruments!  Delay and stereo reverb add depth to the sound, and a resonant lowpass filter gives you more tone shaping power. Put on your headphones or plug in to your home stereo to experience some of the highest quality instruments in the App Store, even  after all these years!\n\nBuild your own loops from the ground up or import your favorites and jam from there. Layer as many loops as you want, with different instruments for each. Export your loops as audio files via WiFi.  Copy and paste audio from other apps using AudioCopy/Paste as well the general pasteboard, via email, AudioShare, iTunes Document Sharing, Files, or open directly in another application. Supports Audiobus and InterApp Audio for streaming sound to/from other apps in real-time, including state save/restore with Audiobus 3.\n\nExtensive MIDI input and output support over WiFi or Bluetooth, with any CoreMidi compatible device, or other apps on the same iOS device with virtual MIDI. Now also supports Ableton Link for tight sync between apps on the same network.

      "label": "You wish you could play any video file on your iPhone/iPad, no matter its format?  that's why we made GPlayer.\n\n@ZDNET: GPlayer fills the iOS void left by VLC!\n\n* Follow our Twitter @GinkgoTech to get the free code when new version released.\n \n* GPlayer was honored as \"app of the Week\" in the Appcast.\n\n* Supported File Format Extension \n\n- AVI(without packet-b frame), WMV, RMVB, ASF, H264, MKV, TS, M2TS... most of all movie file formats.\n- MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG, FLAC... most of all audio file formats.\n- SMI, ASS, SUB, SRT, TXT... most of all subtitle file formats. [build in subtitle is also supported]\n\n* Extra Features\n\n- USB Sync: Use itunes to fast sync movies to GPlayer.\n- WIFI Upload: Upload movie even you don't have the cable.\n- File Management: Support New/Rename/Cut/Paste/Delete.\n- Movie Thumbnail: Easy to find the movie you want to view.\n- Different Play Mode: Support Loop off/Loop One/Loop all.\n- Screen Lock: View your movie even on the bed.\n- Dynamically Menu: Dynamically choose audio/subtitle channel and encoding method.\n- Gesture support: Easier way to do seek while playing the movie.\n- Resume Function: Don't worry about closing your application suddenly.\n- TV Out: Both cable TV out and AirPlay are supported.\n- iTunes Backup: By default, we will not backup media data when you do iTunes sync or iCloud backup, and you can't see the files in iTunes, you can enable it in the settings page to backup your media data.\n\n* FAQ\n\n- How do I put files into GPlayer? \nTo add files to your GPlayer app, you have to go to iTunes, and select the “Apps” tab. At the bottom of this page, there’s a “File sharing” section – just select GPlayer in the list, and add files from there. Note that you don’t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the “File sharing” tab, and they’ll be uploaded immediately. You can even use a friend’s iTunes to add videos to your own iPhone. Also, adding files over WiFi is supported. Indeed, WiFi is significantly slower than USB, and ruins the battery life.\n\n- What kind of streams does GPlayer play? \nGPlayer is able to play RTSP and MMS streams. For now those can’t be added to the media library, but you can click an RTSP or MMS url in Safari or Mail for example.\nIf you want to use GPlayer to open HTTP/FTP streaming, add \"gplayer:\" prefix in the URL.\n\n- I want to explicitely open an attachment with GPlayer? \nIf you want to watch an attachment in GPlayer(from Mail for example), just do a long press on the attachment. A menu will pop-up that will let you pick GPlayer as a player.\n\n- iTunes won’t let me install GPlayer on my iPhone or iPod Touch? \nUnfortunately, we had to drop support for older iOS devices such as the iPhone 3G or the first two versions of iPods. Indeed, after some testing, we realized those weren’t fast enough to provide a pleasant experience.\n\n- Why HD MKV movies don’t play smoothly? \nCurrently, only iPad 2 supports 720p MKV file, that’s to be expected. The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n- The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable \"Skip Frame\" in the settings page.\n\n- Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, supports iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.\n\n* Contact us\n\nMail: gplayersupport@hotmail.com\nWebsite: gplayersupport.wordpress.com\n\n* If you want to help to translate GPlayer to your mother language, just drop a mail to gplayersupport@hotmail.com, that will help people in your country enjoy this software, and we will put your name in thanks page!"

You can play and modulate the sound by moving your hand through the air - just like the legendary Theremin instrument.\n\nGyroSynth makes use of the gyroscope to measure true roll, pitch, and yaw and translates them to sound parameters like pitch, volume, modulation or filter cutoff. Thanks to phenomenal accuracy (2000 degrees), you can play melodies perfectly in tune.\n\nMinimum requirements: iPhone 4 or iPod Touch 4th generation\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Synthesizers: vocal (formant synthesizer), sine wave , square (PWM modulation), saw, granular sample player with recording function and R2D2 - experimental FM modulation\n- Effects: delay and boost\n- Several control modes\n- Included musical scales allow you to effortlessly play in several styles\n- Built-in recorder and player with overdub function\n\n\"There isn’t too much more to say about GyroSynth other than wow!\" AppSafari\n\nEnjoy the new experience!"

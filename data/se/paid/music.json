Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

      "label": "\"LO‑FI‑AF is a very capable lo‑fi toolkit capable of surgically targeted destruction and it could easily find applications in just about any musical genre\" -SoundOnSound\n\nUnfiltered Audio's lo-fi-af is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nlo-fi-af takes your sound on a journey of artifacts and noise throughout recorded history, from tape warbles and vinyl noise to MP3 chirps and cell phone speaker chatter. lo-fi-af's many sections and versatile algorithms can place your sound in a different decade, or give it a thoroughly modern spin through compound processing.\n\nThe first section is a convolution reverb preloaded with impulse responses from broken microphones, toy speakers, cell phones, and more. With this section alone, you can place your sound into an entirely different space.\n\nThe Spectral section then splits your sound into thousands of frequencies before reconstructing it with a twist. Here you can reproduce the sound of a pirated MP3 or pitch shift your signal with clean perfection.\n\nYour signal then takes a trip through the digital section. All sorts of hazards are present here, from a skipping CD stutter effect to a multimode bitcrusher.\n\nFinally, the rich, colorful analog section adds that vibe that you crave. A maximizer, a tape saturator, a noise generator, an analog-style filter, a pitch warbler, and a radio demodulator all work together in harmony to toss your sound into the past.\n\nBut wait! That's only one possible signal chain. The Convolution, Spectral, Digital, and Analog sections can be completely rearranged in any order. Dozens of presets will get your started on your sound warping adventure.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, lo-fi-af has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, lo-fi-af can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with lo-fi-af will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

      "label": "The Moog Model 15 App is the first Moog modular synthesizer and synthesis educational tool created exclusively for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch.\n\nEach facet of the Moog Model 15 modular synthesizer has been meticulously recreated in this application to ensure the power and transcendent sound quality of each module remains intact. The character, harmonic complexity and mystique of the Moog Model 15’s modules, from the legendary Moog 921–series oscillators and 904A Low Pass Filter, to the coveted 907 Fixed Filter Bank have been painstakingly preserved. \n\nIn order to develop the most immersive and expressive modular interface possible, the Model 15 App has been designed utilizing Apple’s new Metal advanced graphics engine. This ensures that all zooming, panning and modular patching throughout the application feels completely natural, something that would have been impossible otherwise.\n \nThe Model 15 App features both monophonic and 4-voice polyphonic operation is easily commanded via 4 seamlessly integrated controllers. Simple swipes and taps provide instant access to a traditional Moog keyboard, 1150 ribbon controller, 8-step sequencing arpeggiator and the award-winning Animoog keyboard with 22 built-in scales and polyphonic modulation capabilities.\n \nAlso included are extended features which expand the capabilities of the app beyond the traditional offerings of the hardware Moog Model 15. These include total MIDI integration, assignment for external control, use as a MIDI controller, dedicated Audio Bridge and MIDI Bridge modules, looping recorder module with overdubbing, a master ping-pong delay module and a new extension cabinet that includes additional amplifiers and voltage-controlled reversible attenuators that can be used for effects like ring-modulation.\n \nBecause the Model 15 App utilizes Apple’s Metal technology, only 64-bit devices are supported. Compatible devices include iPhone 5s or newer, iPod touch 6 or newer, iPad Air or newer, and the iPad Pro.\n\nThe Model 15 App requires iOS version 12.4 or later to work.\n \n\nAdditional Features\n• Ships with over 160 unique presets\n• Recreates the sound of a hardware Moog Model 15 modular synthesizer\n• Easily share presets and recordings with anyone\n• Tutorial patches to assist all experience levels\n• Intuitive patching and cable coloring\n• Support for landscape and portrait modes\n• Voltage-controlled stereo ping-pong delay\n• Expressive sequencing arpeggiator\n• Moog 1150 Ribbon controller\n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing\n• Up to two controllers on-screen (iPad only)\n• Optional left-handed UI operation\n \nSupports\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions\n• 3D Touch and Apple Pencil integration for after pressure\n• Note-per-channel MIDI controllers  \n• Ableton Link\n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• MIDI Bridge and Audio Bridge\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI\n• MIDI Program Change\n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers\n• Typing keyboards for shortcuts and musical typing\n• AudioCopy, AudioPaste and AudioShare"

Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

It also ensures that the staccatos and releases that make up for half of the realism sound perfect, not like a fadeout, not too loud, just perfect.\n\nThe second concentric knobs control Treble and Bass, just like on a real suitcase Rhodes. We measured this carefully and made sure the ranges and frequencies matched the original.\nThe vibrato has two controls, the depth and the speed. We carefully measured the output of the preamp and copied the real output of each channel. We also added a tempo link as it can be very useful. We also extended the original range as this is a common mod on real Rhodes.\nWe measured the output of the preamp of a Rhodes© suitcase and created an exact replica of the stereo panning of the Vibrato. We just added the possibility to sync it to your tempo and also extended the speed range just like some real mods do.\nThere are two very common FX accessible on the front panel: reverb and drive. You can also engage the AMP simulation from the front panel.\n\nThe VTines combines samples and modeling techniques to accurately reproduce the sound of the original instrument. This allows the VTines to weight only 90Mb, to really sound like a Fender Rhodes with all of its imperfections and to have a fully continuous response.\n\nThe « Live » version of our instruments has been especially thought for Live performance usage. CPU and RAM footprints have been optimized, so that our model can run on IOS devices. We paid a particular attention to making it easy to connect and use with external MIDI keyboards, and/or within you favorite AUv3 host\n\n- Sampling and modeling hybrid of a Mark1 Fender Rhodes©\n- Full continuous velocity\n- Perfect staccatos and release samples\n- 7 high quality presets\n- Bass and treble EQ adjusted to the frequencies and ranges of the original preamp\n- Precise modeling of the original Vibrato effect (can be synched to the host tempo)\n- Very detailed Rhodes© AMP simulation\n- Reverberation and Drive FX\n- Adjustable pedal volume, release volume and bell amount\n- Adjustable MIDI response, input sources and channels\n- Adjustable MIDI CCs to control knobs and switches\n- Standalone app and AUv3 plug-in\n- Low download and installation size (less than 90 Mb)\n- Reasonably low RAM and CPU footprint"

      "label": "MagicDelay is a professional, studio grade, spectral delay effect. Spectral because it allows the effect amount to be controlled per-frequency as if you had thousands of delays combined into one. Something not possible in the analogue world. Controlling thousands of delay times sounds complicated, but we made this process really simple. At the heart of MagicDelay is the Curve Editor where you can draw up to 4 separate curves and fluently morph between them using the adjacent XY pad. The final morphed curve can be inverted, shifted, and skewed for further creative control. The delay features two feedback types, control of the amount of feedback, and high and low pass filters.\n\nSync your delay times to your DAW when used in AUv3 supporting apps such as GarageBand is quick and easy. In just a few seconds you can have, for example, a regular eighth delay for the low-mids and a dotted eighth delay for the highs, or any other combination you can think of!\n\nA great delay needs a great modulation system. In the modulation panel tap on an empty modulation slot and get going. Tap the mapping button to enter mapping mode and choose which controls above should be modulated.\n\nRead our in-depth guides on our website for detailed descriptions of everything MagicDelay has to offer."

      "label": "\"Super powerful plugin... Highly recommended.\" - The REAPER Blog\nhttps://reaperblog.net/2022/01/bass-mint/\n\nUnfiltered Audio's Bass Mint is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nBass Mint is a simple-to-use but immensely powerful bass and sub enhancement utility. You can use it to add extra bass to your kick drums, or to make podcast voices more full-bodied.\n\nWith five different modes, Bass Mint can either accentuate and clean up existing bass in your input signal, or it can synthesize new bass from scratch! The SYNTHESIZE and RESONATE modes can be tuned to specific frequencies, allowing you to make any percussive hits sound more in tune with the rest of your song (For extremely quick tuning, dozens of presets are included with correct frequencies for all note values).\n\nBass Mint includes multiple methods of making your bass sit better in the mix. The ANTI-RUMBLE filter removes all inaudible bass from your track, clearing up some headroom to make the audible frequencies louder. MID ONLY affects only center-channel bass, while MONO BASS places all bass below the cutoff directly into the center of the stereo field. The CLARITY knob acts as a quick de-mud control to scoop out some of the mids.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Bass Mint has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Bass Mint can be used on tablets and phones with ease."

If Bootsy Collins, Roger Troutman and Daft Punk would have met up in Studio 54 to create a soft-synth, for sure something like Unique would have come out of it…” Sound & Recording Mag\n\nUnique was made for fun and vibes: Analogue sound, intense modulation and a killer set of features, delivering an amazing sonic spectrum that’s full of character: Classy sounds, powerful, warm… sometimes gritty.\n\nEach of the 2 oscillators offers a selection of 5 waveforms: sawtooth and pulse waves are here, along with noise, triple saw and triple FM waves. There's also an additional sub-oscillator strapped into the master section for added oomph.\n\nThe internal controllers will bring in the dynamics: an LFO and an envelope, there's a recordable XY field & a sequencer. Use these to modulate any knob – a simple long tap will do.\n\nThe sound springs to life when it hits the filter section. Needless to say, analogue high-pass, low-pass and band-pass varieties are in place, along with a comb filter.\n\nStandards aside, the actual intention behind this project, the Vowel Filter, also became its outstanding feature: string together two or four vowel formants and play them back in a multitude of ways.\n\nOnce you’ve built your sound, there’s tons of sound polish in two chained multi-effect units.\n\nFeatures\n\n•\tSawtooth, Triple Saw, Pulse, Triple FM, Noise with tonal Filter, Sub Sine\n•\t5 Filters with 5 Modulators each\n•\tDuophone Arpeggiator\n•\tVowel Filter\n•\tTwo Effect Sections\n•      Audio Unit v3\n•\tAbleton Link Kit\n•\tMIDI Learn & Host Automation\n•\t300 groovy presets by various artists"

      "label": "Been saving up for that Hang, but don't have quite enough yet? You can get busy on our version of the infamous steel instrument. Start it up, bang away, even record your own loop to play along with.  So authentic, your friends will think yours has already arrived. Fill them in on the secret, and they too can download and record their own creations.  Do I hear a \"Hang out\"???\n\nFeatures include:\n* Audiobus 2 support including state saving\n* 45 tunings including microtonal tunings \n* Sounds sampled from actual instrument\n* Loop recording and playback\n\nLittle bit of information about the Hang ... The Hang is a steel percussion instrument that is typically played using the hands and fingers while it rests in the musician's lap.  It was developed in Switzerland in 2000 by  Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer.  There are currently 5 generation models.\n\nOurs is a first generation Hang that defaults to the Aeolian tuning with a D3 central note and a A3 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 A4 tone loop. The eight notes are arranged in a 'Tone Circle' that zig-zag from low to high and are harmonically tuned around the low 'Ding' note in the center.  Select from 45 tunings including microtonal tunings.  These various tunings can be mixed into loops that are being constructed.\n\nMany thanks and kudos to Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer for creating such a unique, elegant, and fun instrument.  For more information about the origin of the Hang, to hear some sound samples, or just to see someone kickin' it, visit one of the following:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(instrument)\nhttp://www.hangdrum.info\n\nThe loop recording in all of the OddTunes apps is roughly modelled after the Gibson / Oberheim Echoplex Digital Pro.  While there are only a few buttons, there is much more functionality there than meets the eye. For more information on the operation of the looper, please visit our Web site at the following address:\n\nhttp://www.avacata.com/iphone/oddtunes/hang/\n\nOddTunes:Hang is one of the many fine instruments coming your way from the Avacata iPhone development team.  Stay tuned for new upcoming OddTunes releases and additions to the loop recording capabilities.\n\nFrom one musician to another ... it's Hang time. Ding, Ding, Ding.\n\n========================\n\nComing soon: \n\n- Save your loops.  Share your loops.  Amaze your friends.\n\n- New tuning packs (we've kept track of all of your requests and have a few of our own)\n\n- MIDI support (in and out)\n\n========================\n\nAlso, check out Avacata's game: Bishook. On the app store now!"

It’s the successor to the original NanoStudio, an app held in high regard by musicians for many years for its usability, quality and productivity.  \n\nNanoStudio 2 builds upon the same design principles as its predecessor and introduces a huge range of extra features.  An all-new audio engine delivers truly professional sound quality, highly optimized to handle complex projects with large numbers of instruments and effects.\n\nNanoStudio 2 hosts external Audio Unit (AUv3) instruments and audio/MIDI effects.  A library of all your AU instruments and presets is maintained so they’re tagged, searchable and just as accessible as NanoStudio’s own internal instruments.\n\nObsidian is NanoStudio’s built-in synth.  It has 3 oscillators with 32 note polyphony and 7 different synthesis methods including analogue, wavetable, FM, multi-saw and phase distortion.  It also supports samples and multisamples which may be split by note or velocity. Obsidian has 18 different filter types, including resonant analogue, super clean digital, formant, comb and waveshaping.

      "label": "Unfiltered Audio's Needlepoint is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nUnfiltered Audio raises the bar (and lowers the tonearm) with Needlepoint: a revolution in vinyl simulation. Continuing the retro themes of their smashed-up hit lo-fi-af, Needlepoint presents a full platter of advanced physical modeling to dive deep into the warm, fuzzy sound of turntable noises and artifacts beloved by many. Of course, since this is an Unfiltered Audio plugin, you can push the needle far past realism and dive into some seriously warped sounds.\n\nWhile many vinyl plugins are content to use looping samples of noise, Needlepoint uses physical modeling to achieve its incredible sound. Needlepoint synthesizes all sorts and sizes of detritus and distress on a record: hair, dust mites, scratches, warping, etc. These are not randomly modeled, but rather accurately distributed onto a rotating, algorithmic platter. Changing the speed of the record can greatly change the nature of Needlepoint's impact on your sound. While you may be used to vinyl RPMs like 33 1/3, 45, and 78, have you ever wondered what it would sound like to tempo sync a turntable to your DAW? Now you can!\n\nBeyond noise, ambience, and tone, Needlepoint includes other effects to fully etch out your vibe. A single knob compressor (inspired by lo-fi-af's PRESS knob with six additional algorithms) can be added before or after the signal chain. This compressor can emulate algorithms from famous hardware samplers associated with vinyl, or even mimic the sound of analog distortion introduced by the vinyl pressing process. A BROKEN mode emulates a broken record a broken record a broken record a broken... Where were we? Oh right, a BROKEN mode acts as an unpredictable looper by jumping the grooves on your recent audio. You can automate the mode's toggle to create all sorts of cut-up and glitchy phrases.\n\nNo vinyl plugin would be complete without a SPINDOWN button that creates that classic vinyl stop (and start!) sound. Here you can control the rate of the spindown to better fit the effect into your mixes. Finally, at the end of the processing chain, Needlepoint features a granular pitch shifter to help you achieve that chopped up vibe without needing to manually change the speed of your tracks.\n\nDespite all of these features, Needlepoint is incredibly easy to use. With a beautiful interface and an extensive set of presets, Needlepoint will help you itch that nostalgic scratch that your tracks need.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Needlepoint has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Needlepoint can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with Needlepoint will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

Maybe adjust the pitch to match your vocals and ready for your jam session\n\nDUO | If you play in a DUO and your team is incomplete, you can record your songs in Left/Right split and then turn off your own part to play along with your records. With playlists you could play through your entire session songs\n\nFor this to work, our BlueJamPlayer has a lot of features to offer:\n#  The player is controlled via Bluetooth by PagerTurner foot pedals\n#  Pitch can be adjusted without changing the speed\n#  Also, the speed is adjustable without changing the pitch\n#  Free configurable effects (reverb, delay, flanger, equalizer, filter)\n#  All songs in your iTunes library can be used\n#  Songs are analyzed to the key, so you know the key when playing solos\n#  The BPM are also analyzed and delay and flanger automatically adjusted to BPM\n#  The playlist management will help to sort your session songs\n#  There are 4 Play Modes with different usage of your foot pedal\n#  The A->B play mode is made to play parts of a song in a loop\n\nWe packed all of that into our small, compact BlueJamPlayer. If you like to know which Bluetooth PageTurner pedals will work, there are suggestions in the Bluetooth setup"

It provides all functions for creating electronic music from scratch.\n\n- Easy to use sequencer, suitable for rhythm and melody\n- Automatisation of all parameters\n- 8 channels, each can be synth or sampler\n- 8 patterns per channel\n- Sample via microphone\n- Re-sample\n- Polyphonic FM-, PWM- and noise synth\n- Song editor with loop function\n- Send and receive projects via e-mail\n- WAV export\n- Sharing projects and audio in file sharing apps like Dropbox is possible when these apps are installed.\n- MIDI sync with other devices\n\n\nThe Synth\n\nNanoloop's FM synth offers a maximum of flexibility within a small set of parameters. It comes with a stereo modulator detune effect and covers the typical clean bells and Rhodes-like sounds, spheric pads, thick beats and basses.\n\n\nThe Sequencer\n\nThe stepsequencer visualises the rhythmic structure in a compact 4x4 square matrix, making it very easy to lay out patterns.\n\n\nThe Sampler\n\nBesides A/D envelope, loop function, start offset, tune and fine tune, the puristic sampler comes without effects. You can record up to 6 seconds via microphone or copy samples via iTunes.\n\n\nShare\n\nWith nanoloop for iPhone, you can send your saved projects to other nanoloop users and your own PC via e-mail. If nanoloop is installed on the recipient's iPhone / iPod, she/he can simply tap on the file name in the received e-mail to start nanoloop and import the attached file so that it is available for editing. This makes collaboration very easy, multiple users around the world can work on the same project by simply e-mailing the file.\n\n\nExport\n\nSongs can be exported to a WAV file that is accessible via iTunes (simply drag & drop files in finder). The exported file is also copied to the clipboard so that it can be pasted in other apps that support pasting audio. If a file sharing app like Dropbox is installed, you can upload the file there.\n\nMore information can be found at the nanoloop website: www.nanoloop.com"

Thus it is possible to launch the app anywhere and at any time.\n\nJEAN-MICHEL JARRE ABOUT EōN:\n  \"-Eon- the name of an ancient Greek God associated with unlimited time and eternity.\n\nI named this project EōN as it symbolizes exactly what it is: an infinite musical and visual creation, which offers to everyone a unique experience, which will never happen again: on each device and each activation of the application EōN, you will hear and see an ever-evolving orchestration of music and visuals. EōN is an endless organic work, never repetitive, that will live and grow indefinitely at your fingertip.\n\nLike in life, every moment lived in EōN will never happen again.\n\nPersonally, I truly feel that EōN is probably one of my most exciting creative projects since Oxygene. I always wanted to create a specific music for each listener, able to evolve constantly in terms of rhythms, tones, tempo, melodies and textures. Here it is. EōN is conceived and composed as a different journey for everyone, with no end determined.\n\nI had a clear idea of the organic, living visuals I wanted to accompany my music, and I was very lucky to spend some time in Tokyo at Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL), where I discovered Alexis André and his singular visual world. Sony CSL with Alexis have conceived and developed an algorithm generating an endless flow of ever-evolving graphics, which, like the music, are infinite and never repeatitive.\n\nThe algorithm and audio engine that orchestrates the music of the EōN app have been engineered by Alexis Zbik & Vianney Apreleff from BLEASS after defining the rules of the system together. \"\n\n\nCREDITS\nConceived and composed by Jean-Michel Jarre\nDigital Graphics by Alexis André of Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc.

      "label": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis"

Discover new ways to create and construct unusual and exciting sounds from any environmental audio recordings or samples recorded from other apps through Inter-App audio or Audiobus.\n\nThe main advantage is that you can record and modify samples along the way within the single app. You can record sounds and noises, delete unwanted parts and then use presets to give a whole new sounding or create spectacular soundscapes and textures to use them as loops in this app. And even use FieldScaper as effect in real time with other apps or external input.\n\nThe FieldScaper consists of two main parts. The first part is the field recorder with special options for different ways of record environmental sound from microphone or record other sound sources. With the sample editor you can cut or split the source sample for more convenient use. The second part is the scaper sound engine that with using dynamic presets can easily transform the most ordinary sounds into something absolutely different. These parts connect with each other into one whole but you can use recorder or scaper independently.\n\nThe FieldScaper supports complete MIDI control for all faders, knobs and many buttons. You can change the parameters of oscillators, filters, delays and mixer by using any external MIDI controller or MIDI apps like sequencers.

      "label": "Note reading made fun! Note Rush is a game for practising note reading on the music staff to help you learn to play the piano, keyboard, flute, saxophone, violin... you name it! Note Rush shows you one note at a time in random order then uses the microphone to listen as you play through them like you would with note reading flash cards, only these flash cards check that you're playing the right note! \n\nPlay with a bunch of fun themes and race to earn stars and beat your best time! Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting. I'm thankful he can do this on his own and it keeps track of his high scores which is highly motivating for him.\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"A blockbuster hit with teachers and students... I especially like using it at group lessons.\" - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me \n\n\"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching.\" - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!\" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club.\" - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com\n\n*** Having trouble? See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student, with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students improve their note recognition across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

You can sequence those little clips in a user-friendly tracker-like interface to shape your song.\nThis is one of the fastest sample based tracker for mobile, you’ll be creating a complete song in no-time! Very useful for beatbox music or song drafts. \n\nHow to make a song in a few simple steps (later explained in the in-app tutorial):\n1) Open the instrument editor and press the big red button to record a new sample.\n2) Polish your sample by adding loop points and removing any silent part it can have.\n3) Use the main tracker-like interface to place notes. Minimic auto detects the pitch of your sample so any musical sound you have recorded will be automatically in tune!\n4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 as much as you like!\n5) By opening the pattern list menu you can add more and more patterns sections to increase and set the order of your song blocks!\n6) Save your song into .mic (project) or export .wav audio files!\n7) Enjoy!\n\nPlot twist! Think inside the box: You can have only a max of 6 sounds playing back at the same time and your clips could be of a max of 1 second (but you can make them loop in ping-pong (start to end and back)).\n\nShow us what you can do with Minimic!\n\nFeedback is appreciated at: staff@minimic.app"

      "label": "DigiStix 2 is an AUv3 compatible drum machine and sampler plugin for your favourite DAW.\n\nThis new version of DigiStix brings some distinct advantages over its predecessor, most notably the ability to host up to 64 samples per drumkit with 5 layers per pad. The interface has been drastically redesigned for iPad to make better use of full screen mode, allowing a popular MPC style 4x4 pad layout with 4 banks of samples. Digistix 2 also allows greater control over the multi-sample layers, with the ability to individually control the volume levels and pitch of layers as well as global pitch and tune settings all from the new sample window.\n\nPreviously, each pad had effect sends for the internal reverb and delay effects, but this can now be routed to external busses 9 and 10 for processing using external effects. \n\nThe controller editing is now build into the main display and can be edited in place without the need to scroll the interface. It also now supports extra effect controllers. A new context aware control window allows you to quickly change pad settings without the need for popup windows. \n\nDigiStix 2 now supports GM and original DS drum kit layouts, and includes a sophisticated multi-layer Auto Sampler, capable of recording new GM compatible drumkits automatically from your hardware. It is 100% backward compatible with the original app, and can be used as a drop-in replacement.\n\nDrag and drop support now allows you to directly drop samples on specific layers, as well as preview and edit them directly. You can create new kits by simply combining banks from existing kits into one mega kit, or use our non destructive referencing to include sounds from other kits.\n\nThe randomize feature has been enhanced so you can randomize individual instruments or within specific banks. The new continuous MIDI learn mode makes custom mapping a breeze.\n\nPatterns can also be exported as MIDI stems for use in other packages including a direct import to Helium clips. You can also export patterns as audio in the latest version.\n\nThe auto sample feature allows automated recording of GM compatible kits directly from hardware drum machines. The slice editor can also be used for MPC style slicing of audio clips.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• 64 Assignable Pads (4 banks of 16 pads).\n• Advanced Randomize Pattern feature.\n• Internal & external effect routing.\n• Mix and match different kits with drum references.\n• Up to 64 beats per pattern.\n• Songs up to 255 patterns in length.\n• Reverse Mode, Triplets and Accents.\n• Supports Mute Groups.\n• Multi-layer and Round Robin modes.\n• DS and GM MIDI Mapping.\n• 64 channel Mixer.\n• 8 band EQ.\n• Randomize Feature.\n• Sophisticated Auto Sampler\n• Export loops to audio and MIDI formats.\n• Looping Mode with Time Stretching.\n• Build in Delay, Reverb, Overdrive, Bit Crunch and LP/HP Filters.\n• Paramter Automation from your DAW.\n• Local and Remove MIDI Sync.\n• Built in Sampler.\n• Multi-bus/outputs when using AUM\n• Multiple Import options.\n• Melodic Remapping.\n• MIDI Mapping.\n• Real time and Step pattern recording. \n• iTunes and Filer importing of samples.\n• Files App Drag & Drop Support\n• Sample Slicer"

    "summary": {
      "label": "SENODE is an innovative music app based on the idea of finite state machines. It works like a polyphonic modular step sequencer with probabilistic steps. This app is perfect for generative music and complex sequencing setups. Senode syncronizes its clock to Ableton Link or integrates as AUv3 plugin. All actions are MIDI bindable, so the steps can be triggered in real time from drum pads, sensors or other apps – a real live-performance instrument!\n\n\"Senode is something quite different when it comes to sequencing\" - Create Digital Music\n\n\"I highly recommend Senode to everyone who is interested in generative music. It's such a fun app to work with!\" - haQ attaQ\n\n\"A Killer App!\" - A4iRebirth\n\n\nCREATE COMPLEX SEQUENCES WITH RANDOMIZATION\n\nThe core of Senode is a graph of nodes connected by edges. You decide if Senode acts like a simple vending machine or a complex pinball game. Each node triggers a sound when activated, while edges determine the direction of travel. Instruments are controlled by emitters which send their tokens onto the graph and generate MIDI signals. That means, you can compose a generative music piece for a whole orchestra using the graph notation and a couple of emitters! It gets more interesting if you add random directions or emit multiple tokens at different time positions.\n\n\nGRAPHICAL MULTI-TOUCH INTERFACE\n\nCompose and perform your music live using the intuitive multi-touch interface. Create, drag and connect nodes with multiple fingers. The on-screen keyboard helps you to visualize and edit notes easily.\n\n\nINTEGRATED SYNTHESIZER \n\nThe standalone app contains a simple but powerful subtractive synthesizer with main OSC (sine, saw, square, noise), sub OSC (sine), 1-pole lowpass filter, stereo reverb and ADSR envelope. Try the demo patches to get inspired!\n\n\nMIDI CONTROL AND STEP RECORDING\n\nUse the step record function to create new nodes on the fly, from single notes or using the chord detection. Use a drum kit, wearable sensors or any other MIDI device to control the steps of Senode. Enjoy the unique experience of being your own clock!\n\n\nCONTROL MUSIC APPS AND EXTERNAL DEVICES\n\nSenode is the perfect sequencer for all MIDI-capable apps. Play in sync with other apps using Ableton Link. Integrate with your favourite DAW using the AUv3 plugin (in-app purchase required). If you connect a MIDI interface, you can even control your hardware synths with the app.\n\n\nREALTIME CONTROL\n\nSenode is made for live music performance. There are no default \"beats\" or \"bars\" and all actions are performed in real time. Tokens can be quantized to a clock (16th resolution) and support catch-up, which means you can hit all functions like a drummer \"on the spot\" and stay in sync, even if you're too early or a little late. By the way, the really cool stuff will happen if you break free from 4/4 bar schemes, start your sequences on off-beat timings or create crazy polyrhythmic cycles...\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n- innovative non-linear graphical sequencer with draggable multi-touch interface\n- standalone app and AUv3 MIDI plugin (in-app purchase required) for iPad and iPhone\n- unlimited notes or chords per step with velocity, legato or fixed-length notes\n- unlimited number of steps and directions: cycles, randomized, one-shot\n- multi-timbral patches with polyphonic emitters\n- live arpeggiator mode with hold and monophonic option\n- integrated polysynth with sine, square, saw and noise OSC, ADSR, filter, reverb\n- real-time sequencer control with clock sync and catch-up quantization\n- MIDI device input and output\n- velocity-sensitive binding support for all sequencer operations like step, emit, tick, trigger or clear\n- tempo and start/stop synchronization using Ableton Link\n- step recording with chord detection\n- copy and paste functionality\n- transpose and clock divide functions\n- comes with tutorial and example patches that you can instantly play\n\nSee senode.org for more details."

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever. For more information about Audiobus, visit http://audiob.us/"

SynthStation transforms your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad into a portable music production studio for mobile music creation. SynthStation gives you three powerful synthesizers for creating and modifying sonic textures used for melodies, chords, and bass lines. Built around Akai Professional’s history in synthesis and drawing on the newest MINIAK synth, SynthStation sounds great and offers wide-ranging sonic flexibility with its virtual analog synthesis.\n\nFrom the moment you start SynthStation, you'll know your way around. It is jam-packed with tools to help you create music with the convenience of your touch screen and each section works the way you work. With SynthStation, you can create and save sequences and complete songs. The app contains three different three-oscillator synths and a range of drum kits you can sequence and mix right in the SynthStation. For creating melodic and accompaniment parts, the SynthStation contains an arpeggiator with preset patterns, built-in effects and filters, and an XY touch control interface for expressive control of key parameters.\n\nPERFORM\nPlay with keys, XY and arpeggiator controls. This is perfect place to make magic happen because it gives you access to all the common controls you’ll need in a performance or creation setting.\n\nSYNTH\nComplete synthesis controls from oscillators to LFOs, envelopes, and more. You can control a wide range of filters to dial in exactly the sound you need. Choose from Sine, Triangle, Square or Sawtooth on your VCO and start creating your own signature sounds from scratch. Filter Cutoff and Resonance are just two taps away.\n\nDRUMS\nIn addition to SynthStation's three synthesizers, we've included drum kits and a visual representation of the most iconic beat making tool in the world - MPC pads.

You can recall your Songs and work on them later, and even export them for further editing in your desktop audio applications.\n\nCONTROL\nXY – two axes of control for hands-on, real-time control. Just like a joystick, the XY controller can snap back to the zero point.\n\nTempo – control tempo and even tap in the tempo you want.\n\nMIXER\nThe Mixer in SynthStation includes touch-controlled faders for each of the three synthesizers and the drum section as well as FX send for each. \n\nMixer – mix all the levels of the parts and effects. Just like a hardware mixer, there are faders, mutes, and effect routing.\n\nEffects – select and control FX type and parameters.\n\nSynthStation Studio enables you to create and produce music anywhere on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad."

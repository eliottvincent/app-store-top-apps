      "label": "Watch any web-video, online movie, livestream or live tv show on your LG Smart TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen with the no#1 web video streamer.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast for LG Smart TV you can browse the web and stream any web video, online movie, livestream or live tv show you want on your LG Smart TV. Mp4, m3u8, hls livestreams and also video-over-https are supported.\n \nThere is no time limit at all! You can watch videos of 2 minutes or 2 hours or even more. Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for link detection and send the video with a single tap to your LG Smart TV. The discovered link will be shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the LG App Store (LG Smart World / LG Content Store) on your TV, search for 'TV Cast' and install the companion app.\n\n* Please enter the ip-address of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your TV Remote or scroll wheel on your Magic Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* Please use the hardware remote of your LG for controlling the TV app and video playback.\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all LG Smart TVs. \n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with LG Electronics or any other trademark mentioned here."

For compatible devices, you can also shoot in the Apple ProRAW format. \r\n\r\n--- Slow Shutter Mode --- \r\n\r\nReeflex offers the best long exposure tools on the App Store. Enjoy the flexibility of manual controls and watch the picture forming on the screen. Select either motion blur or light trails to make people disappear, give moving water a smooth silky appearance, or capture the movement of the night sky for stunning star trails. It has never been easier, the only limit is your creativity. \r\n\r\nOnly a few days after its launch, Reeflex was listed as “Must Have APPS - You Never Heard About!” by the highly popular iReviews YouTube channel. Check out the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M2PjNFbIjM\r\n\r\n--- MAIN FEATURES ---\n\r\n• Motion blur\r\n• Light trails\r\n• Wide range of selectable exposure duration, from 0.5 s to 2 hours.\r\n• Bulb mode for custom exposure duration\r\n• Full manual controls over ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance\r\n• Focus and exposure reticles \r\n• Luma and RGB zebra stripes\r\n• Live RGB and luma histograms \r\n• Advanced focus peaking \r\n• Support for multiple cameras\r\n• Apple’s ProRAW* and RAW** support\r\n• JPEG, HEIF, or TIFF as processed formats\r\n• GPS location in photos’ metadata\r\n• Gyroscopic tiltmeter\r\n\r\n--- ADDITIONAL FEATURES --- \r\n\r\n• Extended digital zoom up to 10x. \r\n• Integrated camera roll.\r\n• Customization of focus peaking color\r\n• Tutorials, tips, and detailed explanations in the settings section.\r\n\r\n--- WHAT'S COMING NEXT --- \r\n\r\nWe are working hard to include more advanced features such as:\r\n• RAW long exposures\r\n• Hand-held long exposures\r\n• Time-lapse, intervalometer, and bracketing\r\n\r\n--- REMARKS ---\r\n\r\n*ProRAW is only supported on iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 pro max. On other devices, when RAW mode is selected, photos will be saved in the Bayer RAW format. RAW mode requires an iPhone 6s or later.\r\n**On devices older than the iPhone 12, the RAW format is not supported on the ultrawide camera.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for new updates!\r\nWe'd love to hear from you and get your feedback.

The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time.

From 4 minutes to 1/8000 sec., aperture from 1.0 to 512 and iso from 3 to 6400.\n\n• Automatic priority for aperture or speed. (Automatic Av and Tv modes).\n\n• Automatic ISO or locked ISO options.\n\n• Point metering in camera view.\n\n• Maximum aperture limited by the selected lens.\n\n• Calculate the average of any number of measurements you want.\n\n• Read the exposure data of any photo from the gallery.\n\n• Calculate hyperfocal distance for 5 memorized lenses. Which also blocks maximum aperture.\n\n• Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.\n\n• Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light. (IR button)\n\n• Exposure value EV on an analog scale or right up front.\n\n• Two LED indicators show whether the measurement is unreliable due to lack of light in the scene, or if we have under 30% battery left.\n\n• On 3.5 \" displays preset lens buttons tilting the device or tapping at the bottom.\n\n• Be advised that accurate incident light reading needs a diffuser attached to the front camera. Without the diffuser still can be used but think about it, it will be a reflected reading taken with the front camera.\n\nI'm an independent photographer/designer/developer and am very grateful for your support. Trying to do the best lightmeter app ever, a lot more to come. You can ask for any improvement and I'll be happy to help. This app is constantly reviewed and improved because it is my tool, if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me by email at davidquiles@me.com\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid Quiles"

      "label": "Obscura 3 is a camera app packed full of features to help you take incredible photos. Obscura pairs a stunning design with intuitive controls that make taking photos a delight.\n—\n\nObscura 2 has been featured numerous times by Apple around the world, including as Editor’s Choice and App of the Day. And Obscura 3 is even better.\n—\n\nDesign\n\nObscura squeezes a bunch of powerful features into simple controls anyone can master. The interface balances aesthetics, ergonomics, and intuitiveness. You won’t want to use anything else. All the camera controls can be reached with one thumb, and gestures and haptics combine to create a tactile experience that lets you stay focused on your subject.\n—\n\nAppearance\nThemes, manual light and dark modes, custom app icons. All gorgeous. \n—\n\n\nCamera Features\n—\n\nModes\nObscura 3 has been designed around 5 distinct camera modes: \nPhoto - simple, fast performance\nPro Photo - maximum control \nDepth - portraits & depth data\nLive Photo - for.. Live Photos\nVideo - video capture with pro controls\n\nExposure\nTo adjust exposure, just touch your thumb to the Exposure Button and move it in a circle, like turning a dial. Couldn’t be simpler and it feels great. And you can just tap the button to instantly reset the exposure bias.\n\nFocus\nJust like exposure, drag your thumb around the Focus Button to focus manually. And you’ll get both a focus loupe and focus peaking to help you get your subject perfectly crisp. ^1\n\nISO & Shutter Speed\nTK\n\nWhite Balance\nAWB, White Point, Scene Presets, and manual Temp + Tint.\n\nPhoto Formats\nProRAW ^2, RAW, HEIC, and JPEG photos, Live Photos and Depth Data ^3. \n\nVideo Formats\n1080p or 4K at 24,30 or 60fps ^4\n\nFilters\nLots of new filters, some old favorites. You can now disable filters and set favorites for quick access. All included.\n\nAspect Ratio\nCapture photos in 4:3, 1:1, 16:9, and 2:1 aspect ratios.\n\nHistogram\nSmall or large, luminance or color.\n\nGrid\nLines, crosshairs, or none.\n\nSpirit Level\nFor perfectly level horizons that would make Wes Anderson proud.\n\nFlash\nYep.\n\nTimer\nI hear tick tock is really popular with the youths.\n\nPresets\nCustomise Obscura to your heart’s content, and save those customisations into presets to quickly access at any time.\n—\n \nLibrary\n\nNot only has the camera interface been redesigned, but the library has been reconsidered from the ground up to give you quick access to your most important photos, without sacrificing performance.\n—\n\nView Options\nObscura lets you configure exactly what’s displayed in the library views, so you can hide screenshots and memes to help you focus on your photos.\n\nYou can also adjust the size of thumbnails to suit your preference. And keep hidden photos hidden. Naturally.\n—\n\nImage View & Editing\nBrowse, share, fav, rate, edit. Whether you want to dig into metadata, triage through your vacation photos, or apply some cool filters, you’ll find it here.\n—\n\n\nSettings & More\nObscura’s Settings has a bunch of options, allowing you to manage filters, tweak camera behaviours, change the theme, read the walkthrough and more.\n—\n\nApple Watch Support\nUse your Apple Watch as a camera remote. You can change capture mode, set exposure and more!\n—\n\nGame Controller Support (Beta)\nIt’s a little rough, but yes, you can use a game controller to control your camera.\n———\n\n\n1. Manual Focus only available in single camera modes, not while using a Virtual Dual or Triple camera. Yes, this sucks but the virtual cameras are weird and full of quirks\n2. ProRAW only available on iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro\n3. Depth Data only available on Dual, Triple, or TrueDepth Camera systems\n4. Video formats vary by device\n\nThanks for checking out Obscura. If you decide to buy, we hope you’ll consider rating it, or sharing with someone you think might like it. \n\nAll the best,\nBen & Adam"

      "label": "DoubleTake by Filmic transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll."

All you need to do is drag, grow or shrink the body parts you want to distort. Find out how you would look like with a different nose, chin, buttock, less weight... \n\nOur app, downloaded 10 million times on all platforms worldwide stands out because of 2 particular features:\n\n1) The distortion algorithm we are using produce very smooth image distortions, such as the ones you find in 100x more expensive professional liquify apps. \n\n 2) Our dual display mode, which clones your image into the other half of the screen when you rotate your device, allows you to modify your image without the encumbrance of your finger hiding the area you are working on. This is ideal for small touch devices such as your phone !!\n\n- New Feature: You can now save morphing animations as videos! \n\n************************ \nWHAT CAN THE APP DO? \n************************ \n\nWith this photo distortion app you can transform any face and body part:\n\n• Nose reshaping\n• Lips augmentation \n• Chin and face contouring \n• Weight loss \n• Muscle augmentation \n• anything you can reshape or shrink! \n\nFor fun or simply because you are curious about how you would look with a differently shaped body part, this app will help you.\n\n\n************************ \nHOW TO USE THE APP? \n************************ \n\nUsing the app is very easy, even on small screens: \n\n• Import a head-shot or full body picture from your camera or device image library. Preferably the subject should be photographed on a unified color background and well lit, so the contours are clearly visible. \n\n• Use your finger to drag or shrink the body parts that you want distorted. For example you can crush this bump on your nose, or even make you slimmer. \n\n• Undo latest changes if you are not satisfied with latest modifications. \n\n• By rotating your device, switch from single to dual view, to easily compare the before / after images on the same screen. \n\n• Zoom in, and use the dual view to see your changes on a real time workspace mirror without your finger in the way. This is a great solution to perform precise distortions on small screens!! \n\n• Launch a morphing animation between the original photo and the modified one to see the old you transforming into the new you! \n\nDownload our app now. Then see how those changes you’ve been wanting to see might look."

Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  \n\nOK!  Now what??\n\nDo you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do! Enable manual mode; set the focus to infinity; change the temperature to a certain number; change the ISO between certain values; change the shutter speed to something else....wait what...?\n\nDon't worry, this app does all of that for you so all you have to do is find those lights.  ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!\n\nWorth a shot !

You can watch the stream on any other iDevice, Mac, Web browser or AppleTV - even on multiple screens simultaneously.\n\nUse your iDevices as luxury babyphones, for serious surveillance, to keep an eye on your pets, a FPV cam in your remote controlled toys…there are hundreds of useful and not so useful things you can do with it. Even if you have just a single device AirBeam is an awesome tool for motion controlled video recording.\n\nAirBeams features in detail:\n* High Quality Realtime: Watch video and hear audio on your remote device in amazing quality with resolution up to Full-HD 1080p, 30 frames per second and CD quality audio. Watch and hear in realtime thanks to AirBeam's low latency encoding and transmission technology.\n\n* Zero Configuration: No need to manually configure device addresses. AirBeam automatically discovers all AirBeam cams on your network and you can instantly watch them.\n\n* Multi Camera, Multi Monitor: Launch as many camera devices as you want and monitor them simultaneously. Or follow a single camera on multiple screens at the same time. On an iPad you can watch up to four cameras at a time.\n\n* Recording: Seeing or hearing something on AirBeam you want to remember? Just press the record button and the video and audio will be recorded. You can also capture still images.\n\n* Motion and audio detection: Trigger alarms or recordings when something happens in front of the camera to create a single track of events that happened during a day.\n\n* Dropbox integration (requires iOS>=9): Uploads recordings directly to your Dropbox account.\n\n* Web interface: Use a browser to watch (no audio in a browser) the live video, download your recordings or adjust the camera settings.\n\n* Two-way audio: Audio streaming works both ways so that you can also talk through the camera device.\n\n* Full remote control: Adjust all camera settings and access to your photo and video library remotely from the monitor device.\n\n* Virtual reality mode: Render the video stream in stereo for watching with a virtual reality headset such as the FreeFlyVR orCardboard.\n\n* Motrr Galileo supported: Remotely pan and tilt your iPhone camera when mounted in a Galileo robotic motion platform.\n\n* AND COMPLETELY FOR FREE: AirBeam viewer app for Mac and AppleTV available in the Mac and AppleTV AppStore.\n\nImportant notes\n=============\n* Best video quality is achieved when AirBeam is used within a local WiFi network. With port forwarding configured in your WiFi router it is also possible to monitor AirBeam cameras on your WiFi at home from anywhere in the Internet. Do do this you need to configure a port forwarding for port 8123 in your WiFi router - see the FAQ pages on our homepage for more details. And check your data plan, live video over cellular consumes quite some bandwidth...\n* Please consider regulations for video surveillance in your country."

To get more reliable values, there is a very simple way to calibrate the camera.\nTherefore, by using this app and then measuring luminance values of each pixel, minimum, maximum, mean, and average values of any area in the scene, or by creating falsecolor images with different scales and color palettes we can evaluate quantity or even quality of light conditions in a realistic space.\nMoreover with the help of the GPS navigation unit and motion sensor, this app can create a sun-path diagram and measure total sunlight hours, and estimate Daylight Autonomy, Continuous Daylight Autonomy and also Daylight Factor for each specific camera point and view direction in the space.\nIt can also create a yearly temporal daylight illuminance diagram of the camera point in the space.\n\nConsidering the Architects needs, all daylight availability estimations, and Sun-Path diagrams, that are mentioned in the above, can be useful for all architects especially when evaluating the existing condition of any spaces.\n\nFor photographers, by creating HDR images that are possible to be saved in the computers, this app can help them to do some image post processing on the HDR images by other computer software.\n\nAnd finally for the real state occupations and those that are planing to buy a new house or apartment, this app can help them to understand the natural light condition and sunlight hours access of each space in the building before deciding to buy them."

If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast.

Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here.

Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots."

Includes support for NDI Discovery server (see app settings), resolution control, video flip for autocue and control of NDI network Protocol for reliability.\n\nNotes: A very stable WIFI connection, or a wired ethernet connection are required for smooth playback of NDI Streams. Using a directional WIFI antenna and using the sweet spot of your wifi can help. If you experience glitching of audio or dropped video frames, the problem is very likely a wifi connection which is insufficiently stable to support smooth NDI video to iOS - in this case please try a wired ethernet to lightning adaptor.\n\nYou should not expect perfect performance when selecting Hi Resolution NDI - which is offered as an experimental mode for users with very fast devices, on very fast, clean network connections.  In some cases you may see great results in hi res.\n\nThere are preferences in the System Settings app for NDI Monitor to setup application options. You can also use the app NDI Scanner as a stream selector -  it will open NDI Monitor when you click on a selected stream.\n \nNB.

      "label": "Finally on iOS™!\nThis app is the official iOS™ version of the classic app White Balance Color Temp Meter that has sold more than 25 000 copies around the world. This new app is much improved with calibration, real-time measurements and more.\n\nHave you ever experienced that the colors of your photos does not correspond to the colors of the scenes in front of you? Let this app help you to get more realistic and better looking photos!\n\nThis app measures the color temperature of the lighting so that you can set the appropriate white balance setting on your camera. You can also use it to measure the Kelvin temperature on LED lamps and other light sources. The app also supports basic green / magenta tint measurement (also known as Duv measurement).\n\nWhat is Color Temperature?\nColor temperature is a characteristic of visible light that measures the hue of light from a light source. Color temperatures are usually measured in Kelvin (K). Low color temperatures (below 3000 K) are called warm colors (red and yellowish white) while high color temperatures (above 5000 K) are called cool colors (blueish white). Technically the color temperature is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of comparable hue to that of the light source.\n\nWhen is Color Temperature Important?\nColor temperatures are of special interest in all kinds of color photography. The human eye easily compensates for the color temperature of different light sources. Most cameras today have a feature called Automatic White Balance, AWB, which tries to do the same. In some conditions this works OK, in other conditions the results are poor. Many photographers therefore prefer to manually set the white balance value on the camera to match the color temperature of the current scene. With this application you can measure the color temperature before doing the white balance setting on you camera to get a more accurate setting.\n\nYou can also use this app to learn about the color temperatures in your environment. With this knowledge you can develop a better understanding of how the color temperatures varies which helps you when you are trying to master the light and colors in your photography.\n\nHow Accurate are the Measurements?\nTo measure the color temperature accurately is more complex than it might appear. On a phone or tablet this is complicated further by the fact that all devices are different from each other. Uncalibrated values from the app can be seen as fairly good approximations. But with the use of calibration supported in this app and a proper white surface evenly lit by the light source you are measuring, you can usually get good accuracy.\n\nGot Feedback on the App?\nPlease send any feedback, ideas or improvement suggestions on the app to apps@contechity.com."

Even if you’ve got a wide angle lens, it’s hard to squeeze everything into the frame and do the scene justice.\n\nTo pack more into the picture, photographers traditionally use the \ntrick of shooting several frames, shifting the camera’s position to capture different parts of the scene. These shots are combined to create one extra-large image. However it’s a fiddly manual process \nthat demands skill and patience to stitch frames together without obvious joins.\n\nNow there’s a fun, easy way to create seamless, ultra-wide pictures with a huge field of view of up to 360 degrees, that’s equivalent to a wide angle lens wie in one frame.

      "label": "Kontakt Film Camera combines the process of analogue photography with the power of your iPhone, to allow you to take better and more considered photographs. Print your photographs in the darkroom to save to your gallery, share on social media, or order physical copies.\n\nCHOOSE FILM - Choose which of our six in built films to insert into the camera, depending on the tone curve characteristics you wish to use. Our Kontakt films are modelled on your favourite Ilford, Kodak, and Fuji films, and apply the correct colour and contrast corrections to the iPhone camera.\n\nSELECT LENS - There are three lenses built into Kontakt Film Camera, a 28mm wide angle lens, a 35mm lens, and a standard 50mm lens. Once these lenses are fitted the rangefinder frame lines will change accordingly.\n\nCOMPOSE - Compose your photos on a traditional rangefinder, that allows you to compose images while seeing what's coming in and out of the frame (which can be especially useful for street photography).\n\nCONSIDER - You can browse all your photos in the darkroom. Your photos are stored in individual films which hang in your darkroom. Scroll up and down to go through different films, and zoom in and out to inspect frames.\n\nDARKROOM - Use genuine darkroom controls to get the most out of your photographs. You can fine tweak the paper grade, and exposure duration to get full contrast control over shadow and highlight details.\n\nPRINT - Once you have created a print in the darkroom, it will be saved to your 'Prints' gallery, where you can order physical copies of your prints as posters, framed prints, or non framed prints.\n\nSHARE - Share your prints to your social networks.\n\nKontakt was inspired by the many great photographers who committed to the process of traditional analogue photography!\n\n“We must avoid however, snapping away, shooting quickly and without thought, overloading ourselves with unnecessary images that clutter our memory and diminish the clarity of the whole.” – Henri Cartier-Bresson"

      "label": "-- NEW External Controllers --\nConnect Tilta Nucleus Nano & Nucleus-M to control Focus, Iris and Zoom, as well as Start & Stop Recording.\nZoom and Focus control supported on Pocket 4K only.\n\nThis is part of the new Pro feature set, which also includes Multi-Cam mode.\n\n\n-- MULTI-CAM MODE --\n\nMulti-Cam Mode is now part of the Pro feature set, and includes these fantastic features:\n• Control up to 12 Blackmagic cameras at once\n• Create up to 3 distinct Control Groups, to give you fine-grain control over different settings for different cameras\n• You can choose to have changes made on one camera automatically update all the other cameras in its Control Group, or control everything straight from Bluetooth+\n• Give your cameras Nicknames to quick, easy control \n\nMulti-Cam gives you control over the following features synced across an entire Group:\n• Start/Stop Recording\n• White Balance + Tint\n• Project frame rate (off-speed frame rates not supported)\n• Shutter Angle/Speed\n• ISO\n• Overlays\n• Slate\n• Trigger Auto-focus\n\nYou can still control all other settings on a camera-by-camera basis, including:\n• Trigger stills capture\n• Iris control \n• Focus + Zoom (on supported lenses)\n• Codec + Resolution\n• Playback control\n• You can also set ISO specifically, rather than by camera group\n\n\nAnd of course, everyone has access to all of these amazing features:\n• Follow Focus (limited support for EF Mount cameras). See below for more info\n• Zoom Control on supported lenses\n• Trigger Stills capture\n• Record Start/Stop\n• White Balance + Tint, including 5 helpful presets and Auto White Balance\n• Audio Controls\n• Trigger Autofocus (for supported electronic lenses with autofocus enabled on lens)\n• Off-speed frame rates\n• Aperture (for supported electronic lenses)\n• Shutter Angle\n• ISO\n• Auto-Exposure Control\n• Active Card\n• Power On/Off\n• Monitor Overlays\n• Codec & Resolution\n• Enter metadata in the Digital Slate (including location data from your iPhone or iPad if you give permission)\n• Control Lock - locks critical controls while recording, preventing accidental settings changes during takes\n\n\n-- Follow Focus --\nYou can now pull focus wirelessly right from your iPhone or iPad. There are some limitations outlined below.\n• Currently only fully supports Pocket 4K, but as of v1.4 we now have limited support for EF mount cameras - Pocket 6K, Ursa Mini Pro G1 & G2\n• The camera does not supply the app with any information on the lenses current focus distance, so the app will not update in real time if you pull focus manually on the lens\n• Due to the nature of bluetooth, focus pulls may not be 100% smooth. It works well for nice slow pulls, but fast pulls my not feel entirely natural and organic. Unfortunately this is a limitation of the available technology.\n• On EF mount cameras, we can only offset focus from its current position, with no broader knowledge of where the lens is in its focus range. This means that focus marks are not possible. In addition, focus pulls on EF mount cameras can be quite jerky depending on the lens in use.\n\n\n-- Playback Control --\nWith Bluetooth+ you can control the playback of clips right from your iOS device. There are some notable limitations at this point. Currently you can:\n• Start playing a clip, either forwards or backwards\n• Navigate between clips, either forwards or backwards\n\nFor now, you will not be able to:\n• Pause a clip that is already playing\n• Change the speed of a clip that is already playing\n• Control clip looping\n\n\n-- Zoom Control --\nControl the zoom level on supported lenses. For the most part, this will only work on MFT lenses with electronic zoom. We are currently unaware of EF lenses that support this feature\n\n\n-- Slate-Only Mode --\nAs the name suggests, this feature locks the app into Slate-Only mode, without the ability to change critical camera settings or start/stop recording. This means you can let an assistant keep metadata up to date without the fear of interfering with important camera settings."

Email them, or save them to your Dropbox.\n- Save multiple sessions to resume your work later.\n- Undo any number of accidental brush strokes.\n- An alternative view mode highlights the regions that will remain in color with a red tint.

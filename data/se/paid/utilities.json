      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

      "label": "NOTE! You phone/tablet MUST have a built in Magnetometer and Accelerometer sensor for the app to work. More info: https://www.laxton.se/ghost-tracker-emf-evp-recorder-app/faq/#info\n\n3-in-1 ghost hunting app developed by Sweden's most popular paranormal investigation team \"LaxTon Ghost Sweden\". More than 30.000 satisfied users have given the app 4.5 out of 5 in average rating.\n\nLaxTon Ghost Sweden has +30 years of combined experience in the paranormal area and more than 100.000 subscribers on their YouTube channel. When developing this application they wanted to select the 3 most useful basic functions used in a ghost hunt.\n\nThe app contains a EMF-scanner, a Motion Detector and a EVP / Voice recorder that will help you to easily detect EMF (Electromagnetic Fields), Motion and EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). With this tool you will have a much greater chance to succeed with your ghost hunts - a ghost tracker app based on scientific sensors in your smartphone / tablet!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEMF METER -  ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD DETECTOR / SCANNER\n\nNOTE! The EMF function requires a Magnetometer sensor.\n\nWe are all surrounded by various electrical devices that create natural electromagnetic fields that are affecting us to varying degrees. Some EMF fields, however, lack natural source and these are extra interesting for ghost hunters. Until the day the researchers succeed in presenting scientific evidence for these EMF fields, the phenomenon is paranormal.\n\nThere is a theory within the paranormal society that you can measure EMF that doesn’t have a natural power source and this can be paranormal activity. This EMF meter allows you to measure and view your EMF value and communicate with the help of the light that shows how strong EMF value the tool is capturing. \n\nEasy to use, click the button and scan the area around you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMOTION DETECTOR / VIBRATION INDICATOR \n\nNOTE! The motion detector requires an Accelerometer sensor.\n\nSometimes you can feel small bangs and vibrations in the floors, stairs, chairs and tables. Within the paranormal society we try to capture these vibrations. With this motion detector you can easily register all vibrations and collect the data for later use. \n\nEasy to use, just place the device where you want to capture motion and then click the button to start collecting motion data.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEVP Recorder - Electronic Voice Phenomenon\n\nElectronic voice phenomena - test record voices from the dead. With this tool you can run EVP sessions, save the data and evaluate / listen at a later time. Within the paranormal society, EVP recorders are used to capture voices considered to come from the other side, ghosts, lost souls, spirits, scary demons, or whatever you choose to call the phenomenon.\n\nEasy to use voice recorder - click the button to record and ask questions, then listen through if you managed to capture voices from the other side.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER\n\nMeasurements performed by this app are based 100% on data from sensors in your phone / tablet. There are no false indications or sound effects. The results are completely dependent on the quality of your phone / tablet sensors.\n\nWe do not recommend replacing dedicated (and much more expensive) equipment with this app (because that type of equipment has stronger sensors).\n\nBecause the results are not scientifically reviewed, we MUST write this; The app should only be used for entertainment."

      "label": "This tool shows you the ultimate precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the time from an atomic time server.\n\nWe are proud to offer version 5 of the Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock. The program is one of the classic applications since the early days of the Apple App Store and has been continually improved based on user feedback.\n\nThe Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock shows the precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the ultimate precise time from cesium atomic clocks available on the internet, or any other time server you like.\n\nThe graphical display mimics the clock display of the legendary Gorgy Timing clocks, which are used in professional radio and television studios, and we spent much effort to bring the original feeling of these wickedly expensive clocks to your iPhone. This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. \n\nVersion 5 contains the following functions:\n\n* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all of the latest iPads and iPads Pro)\n* Optimized for iOS 13 and watchOS 6, full 64 bit support\n* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays\n* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)\n* Local time / UTC time mode\n* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background\n* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds\n* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments\n* Customizable time server sources\n* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, dark green, violet, pink, orange, turquoise and hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments\n* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)\n* 12/24 hours display\n* Optional second tick sound\n* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)\n* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out\n* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)\n* Disabled screen auto-lock\n* Options \"sync at startup\", \"hourly\", \"daily\", or a sync button for manual syncing\n* The last known time delta is used when started without sync\n* \"Night mode\", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery\n* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes\n* VoiceOver support\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\n* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.\n* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), and do not lock your device. Be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, connect it to your charger, or use the app's Night mode, which is much more energy-saving."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Pair your watch as a proper vehicle key, just like your phone! Works under all conditions, including in underground parking garages or in the middle of a desert!\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are never stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is required to supply a refresh token. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers, unless the OPTIONAL cloud processing is enabled, in which case an in-flight encrypted ACCESS token with a lifespan of 8 hours will be transmitted and stored ONLY WHILE COMMAND IS EXECUTING. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

Easily integrate the Prowl API into your applications.\n\nA list of supported apps/services: http://prowlapp.com/apps.php\n\nThe only limit of what the service can do is your imagination.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nTo receive notifications from your computer, you need the latest:\n• Growl on your Mac @ growl.info, or\n• Growl for Windows @ growlforwindows.com, or\n• Snarl on Windows @ fullphat.net, or\n• Any program or web service using the public API.\n\nTHE CRITICS\n\"I was extremely impressed with Prowl and the elegance with which I was able to view Growl notifications on my iPhone.”\n—Aron Trimble, TUAW\n\n\"[A] powerful tool to connect your Mac with your iPhone, seamlessly over the air.\n—Federico Viticci, MacStories\n\n\"Great idea. This opens up iPhone push notifications for anything you can think of.”\n—John Gruber, Daring Fireball\n\n\"Probably the best $3 I’ve ever spent in the App Store.”\n—Darrell Etherington, The Apple Blog\n\nFEATURES\n• Push Notifications—When a Growl notification pops up on your computer, it's sent to Prowl and displayed on your iOS device within seconds.\n\n• Sweet application support—Prowl has support from a bunch of cool applications and services. Check out the full list at http://prowlapp.com/apps.php\n\n• Redirections—Launch a different application when you open a push notification. For example, a notification from your desktop Twitter client can relaunch into your favorite mobile client. You can even pick custom URLs to launch, so you can go anywhere!\n\n• Email to push—Use your Prowl email address (from the Prowl homepage's \"API keys\" tab) to get email delivery right on your device. Generate as many email addresses as you need!\n\n• An amazing API—Use the Prowl API with a multitude of libraries in various programming languages. You can send notifications from anything that can talk to the internet, and do some fun things along with it.\n\n• Quiet Hours—During the hours you specify, only the badge numbers are updated. No matter the source. Instead of getting a noisy alert, messages are quietly delivered. You can allow emergency-priority items to break quiet hours.\n\n• Do Not Disturb—Keep the application quiet whenever you're busy, or when you need a break from a constant alert. Controllable from within the application.\n\n• Control—Open the edit view to get a quick glance at your notifications, and do away with pesky ones. Quickly copy, email or SMS a notification directly from Prowl (depending on device and iOS version).\n\n• Browse quickly—Use Prowl's internal browser to quickly open links from a notification without having to open Safari.\n\n• History—Up to 10 days of notifications are kept on the server. You can delete notifications that you don't want to see any more, or remove all of your history.\n\n• Customized notifications—Only events you want are sent to Prowl. You can specify all kinds of conditions from the Prowl plugin for Growl.\n\n• Send any message to your device—From the Prowl website, you can send any text to your device: links and phone numbers are automatically linked, so you can easily navigate around without having to worry about typos. From the website or API, you can also automatically redirect to the attached URL.\n\nSETUP\nProwl is built into Growl 2.0. For earlier versions: http://prowlapp.com/installation.php — for Mac.\nhttp://growlforwindows.com — for Windows.\n\nSUPPORT\n@prowlapp on Twitter\nhttp://prowlapp.com/support.php"

      "label": "Amplitude Pro includes all of the fun features of Amplitude and now the ability to record and share your audio with your friends!\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro enhances aural experiences by allowing you to hear distant and/or quiet sounds as if you were standing nearby. Amplitude Pro uses the high quality hardware of the iPhone and iPod Touch* to detect and amplify the faintest of sounds. \r\n\r\n***Note: To get the best experience possible, you must use ear buds that do not have a built-in microphone.***\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro lets you adjust the sensitivity of the iPhone microphone to amplify sounds from across a room. You’ll hear things you never would have been able to hear otherwise. \r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro also lets you record and save the amplified sounds to your device and share them with your friends. To do this, all you have to do is press the red button at the bottom of the screen. To stop it, you simply press the button again. Now you can detect and have proof of that “ghost” that you always hear that everyone made fun of you for and prove them wrong!\r\n\r\nUsing Amplitude Pro is easy: simply launch the app, point your device in the direction of the sound you want to amplify, and starting hearing the world in a new way through your headphones. Individual controls enable you to adjust the microphone sensitivity or mute the sound amplifying feature altogether.\r\n\r\nUse Amplitude Pro to explore your world. Experience all the sounds of your environment that you would otherwise have missed.\r\n\r\nExperience Nature and Wildlife More Intimately. Record and share the sounds with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperimenting Around Your World\r\n\r\n- Diagnose the source of that annoying squeak in your new car and send it to your local mechanic.\r\n\r\n- Attach a cup or small plastic bowl to the end of your iPhone to focus the incoming sound and expand your range\r\n\r\n- Place microphone against an office wall to hear sounds from all over the building and listen to what everyone is talking about!\r\n\r\nAmplitude Pro Benefits:\r\n\r\n- Turns your iPhone or iPod Touch* into a sound amplifier\r\n\r\n- Hear sounds through thin walls or doors\r\n\r\n- Adjustable microphone sensitivity / boost\r\n\r\n- Adjustable volume and mute controls\r\n\r\n- Independently control the iPhone volume and the microphone sensitivity\r\n\r\n- View sound waves on the oscilloscope\r\n\r\n- Record and share each and every sound you encounter!\r\n\r\n***Ear buds are required for use with all devices. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation iPod Touches require ear buds with a microphone whereas the 4th generation iPod Touch can use ear buds without a microphone.***\r\n\r\nTips on Using Amplitude Pro:\r\n\r\n- For best audio reception, point the microphone in the direction of the sound you want to pick up. \r\n\r\n- Amplitude Pro controls are oriented upside down from other apps so that the microphone can be pointed toward target sounds.\r\n\r\n- To protect against accidental ear damage, Amplitude Pro starts in Muted mode. You can change the default in the settings screen.\r\n\r\n- For optimal performance, we recommend keeping device volume between 50-75%.\r\n\r\n- Experiment with microphone sensitivity. Some situations will require more, some less.\r\n\r\n- To preserve battery life, launch the application and press the device sleep button to darken the screen.\r\n\r\n- You can maximize your reception by using your hands or a plastic cup to focus the incoming sound. This is the best method to use when listening through solid objects like doors or walls.\r\n\r\n- Like any exposed microphone, the iPhone microphone is sensitive to wind noise. For best results we recommend using Amplitude Pro in non-windy situations. \r\n\r\n- Experiment with different attachments and microphone settings and let us know what works best for you.\r\n\r\nSend us your stories or YouTube videos to Amplitude@GripWire.com.

      "label": "TslaMirror for iOS \nTslaMirror is an App that will help your iPhone App mirroring to Tesla vehicle! Also, it can support App screencast to a Chrome browser.\n\nFor Tesla vehicle built-in browser\n1 Make sure the car is PARKED (0mph/0kph)! \n2 The Tesla vehicle network must be connected to the iOS device Personal Hotspot (cellular data needed) first. Tesla MCU2 hardware is needed. MCU2 is available on the Tesla Model \n3 Model Y, Model X (late than March 2018), Model S (late than March 2018), or the Tesla vehicles that are upgraded to MCU2 from MCU1.3 Start the TslaMirror App. Confirm \"Tesla Proxy\" switch is on in the TslaMirror App\n4 Click the \"Start\" button, then click \"Start Broadcast\" to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n5 Access the link http://240.3.3.3 via Tesla vehicle in-car browser\n6 Pinch the Tesla vehicle built-in browser screen to zoom in/out the picture\n7 There is no audio support for the moment. Only the App screen will be mirrored to the browser. You can use the Bluetooth audio link to the Tesla vehicle play the audio of the iOS device simultaneously during the App mirroring.\n8 Do not lock the screen. The Screen Broadcast API limitation needs the screen to keep unlocked. Once the screen is locked, Screen Broadcast needs to be restarted.\n\nFor normal desktop browser\n1 Devices are on the same Wi-Fi network\n2 Start the TslaMirror App.\n3 Click the \"Start\" button to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n4 Access the link below the \"Stop\" button via a normal desktop browser (Safari or Chrome)\n\nKey Features\n1 No extra internet traffic for the screencast, the App mirroring traffic is only locally on iOS device Personal Hotspot. However, please note that during the screenshot, the Tesla vehicle will use the hotspot traffic for its internet access when the hotspot is connected\n2 No extra hardware needed\n3 Private, the screencast is only available to the devices connected to the iOS Personal Hotspot Wi-Fi network\n4 Fast network\n5 5GHz Personal Hotspot(iPhone 12 series supports it) Wi-Fi is highly recommended. Do not enable the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting for iPhone 12 series. By default, iPhone 12 series come with a 5GHz Wi-Fi Personal Hotspot. Once the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting enabled, it will go back to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nFAQ\n1 This is not CarPlay\n2 iOS Apps that use the AVPlayer framework cannot be supported, such as the Apple Music App and Netflix App. For the Apple Music App, although the screen can be streamed to the browser, the audio part will be muted during the Screen Broadcast.\n3 Netflix App not supported\n\nPrivacy/Security notice: This App does not collect any statistics, personal information, or analytics from our users.This Application does use Location service to access Wi-Fi access point network name on iOS 13 or later.

Change it too!\n\nNightstand X is excellent when traveling, because it's darker than many hotel room clocks, and the time is always correct. It's even got a rainbow of color options!\n\nThe alarm feature is brand new and designed from the ground up. Many different sounds are available to choose from, whether you want the classic Alarm sound for that jolt of adrenaline, or a soothing melody to gently pull you from your slumber.\n\nWhile Nightstand X supports many different versions of iPhone, when paired with an OLED phone (iPhone X, XS, XS Max, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max), Nightstand X is the darkest bedside clock available!"

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "The knitting calculator computes how to increase and decrease stitches evenly. The app is responsive, simple and intuitive, and also contains a list of abbreviations and a counter.\n\nTip # 1:\nUse the app to figure out where to make buttonholes by entering the number of stitches and the number of buttonholes to the decrease module of the calculator. Create the buttonhole when asked to \"k2tog\".\n\nTip # 2:\nUse the app to figure out how to pick up stitches to make the placket even by counting the number of stitches per inch, subtract the number of stitches the pattern says it should be every inch, using the decrease module of the calculator to find where to skip a stitch when stitches are picked up \"k2tog\".\n\nExperience issues, need help or have a recommendation?

      "label": "Calculators have changed very little since the 1970s - while phones from that era look ancient. Why should calculators cling to a 40 year old design with a wall of buttons and one row for results in the age of retina displays? We deserve something better. Tydlig brings the calculator to the next level for iPhone & iPad with innovations like freeform canvas, responsive results and linked numbers. \n\nTydlig is perfect for calculating everyday things like tips and discounts, showing the entire history and allowing you to change any number with instant updates. For deeper calculations real-time graphing is an excellent way to explore and visualize things like bank interest rates and trigonometric functions.\n\nFeatures: \n\n* Responsive results: Edit any number on the canvas and see all results update automatically. Let your calculator work for you, not the other way around. \n\n* Linked numbers: With a result selected, press any operation to create a linked number below. Responsive results will cascade down these links. \n\n* All history is stored on an infinite scrolling canvas. Drag numbers around and reuse them as you wish.\n\n* Annotate any number with an attached text label, like a freestyle spreadsheet.\n\n* Real-time graphing: Link numbers to a graph and any change to the expression will instantly update the graph. Perfect when trying to explore how functions work and behave.\n\n* Use the Slider to tweak any number and see results and graphs update in real-time. Combined with the graph it is an excellent way to visualize and teach math. Tap the slider to toggle between discrete and continuous modes.\n\n* Share the entire canvas by printing, or exporting as a high quality PDF. You can also copy calculations as text, or save the visible area as an image which can be used in other applications like Pages or Word.\n\n* Undo support.\n\n* Supports external Bluetooth keyboards for really quick digit and basic operations entry (+, -, *, /).\n\n* Tydlig works completely offline, no need to be connected to the internet. \n\n* Lots of power under the hood with a lightning fast calculation engine, over 20 mathematical functions  and scientific notation formatting options."

You can measure everything in a simple way: from \"face to face\", or ”center to center”, and quickly get the solution in the App. Standard pipe sizes and long radius elbows (including ANSI and DIN) can be selected from the list of up to 40 inches.\nThe entire process consists of three steps: \n1) determining the purpose of calculation (question mark symbol)\n2) entering the data \n3) displaying the result of a calculation.\n\nThe result: we have all the necessary information which are needed to create and fold your pipe. Drawings clearly show you the way of what you are looking for and what you need to do. It speeds up the process of work of pipe fitters. \nThe application is being updated all the time and oriented to develop and extend, basing on suggestions of other pipe fitters."

      "label": "Twixt Time helps track the longterm accuracy of watches and clocks, by collecting & analyzing precisely timed snapshots of their dials. \n\nUse Twixt Time to take a picture of the dial of an analog clock or watch. Each picture captures the exact time displayed on the dial. Twixt also notes the precise instant that the each snapshot was taken, by communicating with highly accurate NTP timeservers on the Internet. \n\nA new snapshot of each timepiece can be added everyday. Using the information from 2 or more snapshots of the same timepiece, Twixt will calculate and show you how precisely the watch or clock is keeping time. \n\nTwixt tracks the most recent rate, overall average rate, and cumulative gain or loss for each timepiece.\n\nSupported dial configurations:\n\n* Hour & minute hands with a central seconds hand\n* Hour & minute hands with seconds displayed in a subdial\n* Hour & minute hands only\n\n\nDoes Twixt Time work with GMT watches?\n\nYes. Twixt Time does not need to track the 24 hour hand of GMT watches to measure their precision. It is only necessary to track the hour, minute, and second hands. For GMT watches with central seconds, select the \"central seconds\" layout. For GMT watches with an offset or subdial seconds hand, select the \"subdial seconds\" layout. Twixt Time automatically monitors timezone changes based on the timezone setting of the iPhone or iPod touch.\n\n\nDoes Twixt Time work with chronograph watches?\n\nYes. The chronograph functions of a watch do not need to be measured to track the precision of the watch. Twixt Time tracks the precision of chronographs, as well as watches with other complications, in the exact same way that it tracks the precision of a normal, time-only watch. If the central seconds hand can be stopped and reset with the chronograph function, select the \"subdial seconds\" layout to track the small seconds hand with Twixt Time. If the central seconds hand continues to move when the chronograph is stopped, but the small seconds hand stops, select the \"central seconds\" layout to track the central seconds hand with Twixt Time. Most chronographs will use a subdial seconds layout.\n\n\nDoes Twixt Time work with watches that have an offset seconds hand?\n\nYes. For watches with a second hand that is not concentric with the hour and minute hands, select the \"subdial seconds\" layout.\n\n\nDoes Twixt Time work with quartz watches and clocks? Or other watches and clocks that are powered by batteries?\n\nYes. Twixt Time works with battery powered watches and clocks that display the time with an hour, minute, and/or second hand. It does not work with watches or clocks that only display the time digitally.\n\n----------\n\nTwixt Time is not affiliated with or endorsed by any watch or clock brand. The timepieces shown are for demonstration purposes only."

I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

Measurements are displayed on top of a target curve, making it easy to see where adjustment is needed.  Multiple measurements can be averaged to fully capture how the system sounds in the listening area.  With small changes and repeat measurements, you can manually tune your system to the target curve.  If your audio system has a parametric equalizer or convolution engine, HouseCurve can automatically generate filter settings to match the target curve.\n\nHouseCurve can help with home and car audio system tuning, from system equalization and room correction to subwoofer time alignment and speaker placement.  Visit housecurve.com for more information on how HouseCurve works and how to use it.\n\nFree trial - visit housecurve.com and give the HouseCurve app clip a try.\n\nHouseCurve will produce acceptable results with the built in iPhone/iPad microphone. Using calibrated external microphones will provide higher accuracy."

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

Any ambient noises can affect result accuracy. Complete silence is the best.\n\nRecommended way to record the ticks is to touch the crown of the watch with the headset microphone. You will get the best results using original Apple EarPods.\n\nThis is a simple version of Watch Tuner application. Not everyone needs detailed information about a watch movement, sometimes only accuracy is important. Watch Tuner Lite uses very similar algorithm like Watch Tuner does but displays only seconds-per-day deviation.\n\nIf you want to know how much your watch is fast or slow, this application is for you.\nIf you prefer to measure also beat error and amplitude, try Watch Tuner - a bigger brother of this app.\nIf you need frequency diagram look at Watch Tuner Timegrapher - the most sophisticated app of Watch Tuner series."

      "label": "Anyone can make their own tunes in Forza. It comes down to doing the right math, taking a test drive and knowing when to make a few adjustments. Nothing magic. ForzaTune Pro does the complex math for you, and makes it easy to adjust the car to your driving style and skill.\n\nTell ForzaTune you're driving a Supra on the streets of Mexico, and it creates a tune to match. If you prefer a more aggressive or more stable feel, then open up the tune customizer to set oversteer or understeer in each part of a turn. ForzaTune works out the new values for you automatically.\n\nThere's nothing better than driving a car dialed in how you want it. And a car that feels planted lets you drive faster.\n\nThis Pro version includes many extra tuning types like rally, drag and drift plus gearing options, the ability to save tunes, and finer control over your tune balance.\n\nHere are the complete specs if you'd like to learn more:\n\nONE APP TO TUNE THEM ALL\nForzaTune Pro has support for Forza Horizon 5, Forza Horizon 4, Forza Motorsport 7 and also includes most vehicles in Forza Horizon 3 and Forza Motorsport 6.\n\nMAKE STREET, DRIFT, RALLY TUNES AND MORE\nNo matter what kind of driving you like, this tuning app has you covered. Create standard (street/track), drift, drag, rain, rally/snow, and off-road tunes with ease.\n\nLEARN HOW TO QUICKLY FINE-TUNE\nAdjust the overall balance, turn entry balance, turn exit balance, ride stiffness, roll stiffness in seconds.\n\nRETUNE GEARS WITH EASE\nIncludes a gearing calculator option that lets you match race transmission values to engine swaps or major power upgrades. \n\nTUNES ARE TAILORED TO EACH CAR\n1140+ vehicles covering Forza Horizon 5 back through Forza Motorsport 6. Tuning for some special editions (F&F, Team Forza, FE) is done with the base car unless noted otherwise. ForzaTune does not include oval racing vehicles or tuning.\n\nACCURATE FORMULAS\nForzaTune Pro combines your input with its vehicle and track databases to create original, balanced tunes. Formulas are based on real race engineering. They are also tested extensively with a gamepad and steering wheel/pedal set.\n\nSAVE AND MANAGE YOUR TUNES\nSave, edit, search and backup all of your tunes. Export and import options let you transfer your tunes to new devices or friends easily without logins or accounts.\n\n-----\nFAQs\n-----\nQ: Is this for beginners or experienced tuners?\nA: Both. Experienced tuners use it to save time. Newer tuners use it to learn how to tune.\n\nQ: How do I use the app?\nA: Copy several car details from the game into ForzaTune, hit \"Next\" and copy the results into the tuning menu in Forza Horizon 5 or an earlier Forza title. There is also a series of video tutorials on YouTube to get you started.\n\nQ: What settings and upgrades do I need?\nA: You will need racing upgrades like suspension, braking, anti-roll bars, and differential to change the values in the tuning menu. You can also use drift, rally and adjustable stock suspensions when available (like off-road buggies and some trucks in Horizon). You will also have the best results if you disable stability management (STM) and traction control (TCS) for lower class cars. Normal or simulation steering is fine, but simulation steering is recommended in FH5 especially when fine-tuning.\n\nQ: Why is tuning your cars important?\nA: When doing upgrades many of the default tune settings will not match the new build. ForzaTune brings it back to a balanced setup. Also, tuning doesn't affect your PI or race restrictions—so this is how you can gain an advantage over other racers.\n\n---\nMake better tunes faster with ForzaTune Pro."

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n• 2-finger click to open a link in a new tab\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Font replacement. Substitute one font for another on web pages, such as Helvetica for Arial and Courier for Courier New.\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

Reverberation time is a measure of how long a sound persists in a room after the sound is turned off, i e a measure of the room echo.\n\nThe techniques and algorithms in this app follow the international measurement standard ISO 3382-2 and measures reverberation times in the octave bands between 125 Hz and 4 kHz, which are the most common frequency bands used for most rooms. The algorithms are validated against the laboratory standard ISO 354 for best accuracy. Any impulsive sound can be used as source, e g a handclap, a dropped book. For best results use the specially designed impulsive source provided by Acoustic Facts (see our website http://acousticfacts.com).\n\nThe measured values can be used as input in the room acoustics web tool that can be found at http://acousticfacts.com. At the site there are ample products that are validated and that can be used to modify the reverberation time."

Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality. \n\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\n\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n- Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n- Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser...): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n- Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater... \n- For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n- Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n- Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note: \n- you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n- the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n- no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n- The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n- The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n- you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation."

      "label": "NOTE! You phone/tablet MUST have a built in Magnetometer and Accelerometer sensor for the app to work. More info: https://www.laxton.se/ghost-tracker-emf-evp-recorder-app/faq/#info\n\n3-in-1 ghost hunting app developed by Sweden's most popular paranormal investigation team \"LaxTon Ghost Sweden\". More than 30.000 satisfied users have given the app 4.5 out of 5 in average rating.\n\nLaxTon Ghost Sweden has +30 years of combined experience in the paranormal area and more than 100.000 subscribers on their YouTube channel. When developing this application they wanted to select the 3 most useful basic functions used in a ghost hunt.\n\nThe app contains a EMF-scanner, a Motion Detector and a EVP / Voice recorder that will help you to easily detect EMF (Electromagnetic Fields), Motion and EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). With this tool you will have a much greater chance to succeed with your ghost hunts - a ghost tracker app based on scientific sensors in your smartphone / tablet!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEMF METER -  ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD DETECTOR / SCANNER\n\nNOTE! The EMF function requires a Magnetometer sensor.\n\nWe are all surrounded by various electrical devices that create natural electromagnetic fields that are affecting us to varying degrees. Some EMF fields, however, lack natural source and these are extra interesting for ghost hunters. Until the day the researchers succeed in presenting scientific evidence for these EMF fields, the phenomenon is paranormal.\n\nThere is a theory within the paranormal society that you can measure EMF that doesn’t have a natural power source and this can be paranormal activity. This EMF meter allows you to measure and view your EMF value and communicate with the help of the light that shows how strong EMF value the tool is capturing. \n\nEasy to use, click the button and scan the area around you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMOTION DETECTOR / VIBRATION INDICATOR \n\nNOTE! The motion detector requires an Accelerometer sensor.\n\nSometimes you can feel small bangs and vibrations in the floors, stairs, chairs and tables. Within the paranormal society we try to capture these vibrations. With this motion detector you can easily register all vibrations and collect the data for later use. \n\nEasy to use, just place the device where you want to capture motion and then click the button to start collecting motion data.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEVP Recorder - Electronic Voice Phenomenon\n\nElectronic voice phenomena - test record voices from the dead. With this tool you can run EVP sessions, save the data and evaluate / listen at a later time. Within the paranormal society, EVP recorders are used to capture voices considered to come from the other side, ghosts, lost souls, spirits, scary demons, or whatever you choose to call the phenomenon.\n\nEasy to use voice recorder - click the button to record and ask questions, then listen through if you managed to capture voices from the other side.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER\n\nMeasurements performed by this app are based 100% on data from sensors in your phone / tablet. There are no false indications or sound effects. The results are completely dependent on the quality of your phone / tablet sensors.\n\nWe do not recommend replacing dedicated (and much more expensive) equipment with this app (because that type of equipment has stronger sensors).\n\nBecause the results are not scientifically reviewed, we MUST write this; The app should only be used for entertainment."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Pair your watch as a proper vehicle key, just like your phone! Works under all conditions, including in underground parking garages or in the middle of a desert!\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are never stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is required to supply a refresh token. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers, unless the OPTIONAL cloud processing is enabled, in which case an in-flight encrypted ACCESS token with a lifespan of 8 hours will be transmitted and stored ONLY WHILE COMMAND IS EXECUTING. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

Is uses the build-in or headset microphone to record audible ticks of the clock and calculates seconds-per-day deviation. It works with almost every 'ticking' clock.\n\nUse in a quiet environment. Any ambient noises can affect result accuracy. Complete silence is the best.\n\nRecommended way to record the ticks is to touch the crown of the watch with the headset microphone. You will get the best results using original Apple EarPods.\n\nThis is a simple version of Watch Tuner application. Not everyone needs detailed information about a watch movement, sometimes only accuracy is important. Watch Tuner Lite uses very similar algorithm like Watch Tuner does but displays only seconds-per-day deviation.\n\nIf you want to know how much your watch is fast or slow, this application is for you.\nIf you prefer to measure also beat error and amplitude, try Watch Tuner - a bigger brother of this app.\nIf you need frequency diagram look at Watch Tuner Timegrapher - the most sophisticated app of Watch Tuner series."

Why should calculators cling to a 40 year old design with a wall of buttons and one row for results in the age of retina displays? We deserve something better. Tydlig brings the calculator to the next level for iPhone & iPad with innovations like freeform canvas, responsive results and linked numbers. \n\nTydlig is perfect for calculating everyday things like tips and discounts, showing the entire history and allowing you to change any number with instant updates. For deeper calculations real-time graphing is an excellent way to explore and visualize things like bank interest rates and trigonometric functions.\n\nFeatures: \n\n* Responsive results: Edit any number on the canvas and see all results update automatically. Let your calculator work for you, not the other way around. \n\n* Linked numbers: With a result selected, press any operation to create a linked number below. Responsive results will cascade down these links. \n\n* All history is stored on an infinite scrolling canvas. Drag numbers around and reuse them as you wish.\n\n* Annotate any number with an attached text label, like a freestyle spreadsheet.\n\n* Real-time graphing: Link numbers to a graph and any change to the expression will instantly update the graph. Perfect when trying to explore how functions work and behave.\n\n* Use the Slider to tweak any number and see results and graphs update in real-time. Combined with the graph it is an excellent way to visualize and teach math. Tap the slider to toggle between discrete and continuous modes.\n\n* Share the entire canvas by printing, or exporting as a high quality PDF. You can also copy calculations as text, or save the visible area as an image which can be used in other applications like Pages or Word.\n\n* Undo support.\n\n* Supports external Bluetooth keyboards for really quick digit and basic operations entry (+, -, *, /).\n\n* Tydlig works completely offline, no need to be connected to the internet. \n\n* Lots of power under the hood with a lightning fast calculation engine, over 20 mathematical functions  and scientific notation formatting options."

      "label": "Vibration is a true vibration spectrum analyzer using the built in accelerometers and gyroscope inside the iPod Touch and the iPhone and starting with version 3.x it can sample the built in microphone and the Digiducer professional quality external USB accelerometer.  It acquires and displays time series data, optionally removes DC bias, applies a Hamming window and performs an FFT on each channel to produce frequency spectra.  The 3-channel accelerometer has a sensitivity of approximately 0.02g and a range of ±2g making the iPhone and iPod Touch sensitive enough to analyze the vibration of most moving machinery. \n\nIn many applications Vibration can be an excellent portable alternative to a commercial spectrum analyzer.  In predictive maintenance applications Vibration can help identify bearing defects, shaft misalignment, imbalance, and structural resonant frequencies.  Vibration is also useful for monitoring the acceleration of part and material handling equipment.  \n\nThe software is flexible and easy to use.  It was written to emulate the familiar oscilloscope based spectrum analyzer.  Sample rate and sample delay are easily adjustable and the user can select the length of the data acquisition and the vertical scale used for the display.  Once the settings are configured simply press the sample button on the device or on your Apple Watch.  When a test is complete the resulting data can be emailed to your desktop computer for documentation purposes.\n\nFeatures:\n\n•  Sample the built in accelerometer or gyroscope, the internal Microphone or the professional Digiducer USB products including the 333D01, 333D04, 633A01 and 435B39. Additional Digiducer accelerometer features can be enabled via in-app purchase.\n•  Adjustable sample rate from 10Hz to 100Hz for the internal sensors and 1 kHz to 48 kHz for the internal microphone and the Digiducer accelerometer (with in-app purchase)\n•  Trigger sampling and review settings using the Apple Watch companion app.\n•  Auto repeat and auto save allow data to be taken over extremely long periods of time.\n•  Selectable data length from 256 to 4096 samples\n•  Variable start delay from 0 to 20 seconds\n•  Adjustable vertical scale for time series  data\n•  DC Remove option to get rid of the gravity vector\n•  Switchable Hamming window for frequency analysis \n•  Frequency data plotted as Linear-Linear, Log-Log, Log-Linear and Linear-Log\n•  Computes rms and peak levels for each channel and for all three channels combined\n•  Document your results by taking screen snapshots and syncing them to your computer or sending a CSV formatted email with the time and frequency data to your computer or saving data locally and downloading the data with iTunes\n•  Turn on and off individual frequency plots\n•  Calibrate the internal accelerometers and examine and edit the calibration data\n•  Optional sounds to mark the start and stop of data acquisition \n•  Data inspectors and zoom\n•  Triggering off one or more accelerometer channels or microphone input.\n•  Frequency data averaging and peak hold.\n\nFurther development and additional features are planned.  Please use the email links in the program to request new features and report any problems."

With that said, continued use of the flash may dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nThis app is primarily financed through the use of Apple's iAd feature.

      "label": "SSH Tunnel is the best and most convenient way to manage SSH tunnels on a mobile device running iOS. \n\nThe application allows you to configure a local socks5 proxy with a private tunnel to your own server.\n\nMain functions and features of the application:\n\n- Local Port Forwarding (works similar to: \"ssh -L 80:intra.example.com:80 gw.example.com\")\n- Dynamic Port Forwarding (SOCKS5 proxy)\n- Password, Private Key, 2FA (OTP) authentication\n- Supported SSH Keys: ECDSA, ed25519, RSA, PuTTY keys.\n- Host Key Fingerprint checking feature\n- Connection data transfer statistics\n- Connection Export & Import (iCloud Drive and other services)\n- Passcode & Face ID protection\n- Provides a local URL for a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file (for WiFi proxy autoconfiguration)\n- Idle disconnect timer\n- Advanced logging for a debug purpose\n- Add free app\n\nYou need to have an SSH server configured to use this application.\n\nThe advantage of the SSH Tunnel is the ability to fully control traffic redirection. The application allows manual configuration of the PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) file using special rules. For example, redirection depending on the Wi-Fi network to which the phone is connected (home/work), time of day or the address of the requested resource itself.\n\nSSH Tunnel support email: support@mobibean.zendesk.com"

It works if they know your password and even if no password is set for the lock-screen.\niAmNotified is the solution to definitively secure your device! \nIt acts as a watchdog that lets you know if someone accessed your iPhone or iPad while you were not looking. It can also alert people that you are monitoring the device, discouraging any malicious access.  \n\nNo one can access your device without the password. But...\n\nWhat happens if your sneaky colleague or friend peeks while you type it in? \nWhat if your partner or parents simply demand it? (\"Why don't you give me your password, are you hiding something?\".... does this sound familiar?). \nWhat if someone uses your fingerprint to unlock your device while you sleep? (yeah, it has happened, check the press).\n\nThey would have access to your entire life: pictures, videos, contacts, whatsapp conversations, facebook chats, emails (which mean access to any of your online accounts via password reset), etc.\nThey might even install malware to spy on you remotely!\n\nTHE WORST PART IS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE. \nThat you need to change your password. That a tracking virus is running on your device. That you have to alert your bank. That your competitor has stolen your confidential data.  That your partner knows about \"those\" pictures and conversations and you'd better prepare a good excuse....\nThat people you trust don't respect your privacy!\n\n\n+++ HOW IT WORKS +++\n! THE SIMPLEST APP EVER !\n1. open the App\n2. lock the screen\n\nThat's it! Your device is Secured!\n\nYou will immediately receive a notification on the lock-screen. The notification will remain there until the screen stays locked. If anyone unlocks the screen while you are away, the notification will not be there when you return, alerting you that someone had access to your device.\nThe notification changes every single time for extra security.\n\nThe History Log keeps track of the last notifications shown, so by-passing the system is virtually impossible. \n\n+++FEATURES +++\nDouble Function: use the app with STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS to catch anyone who is spying on you, or with DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS to let everybody know that you are monitoring any access to the device.\n\nYou choose what appears on the notification: \n\n+ STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS (simulate a useful notification, to disguise the true nature of iAmNotified)\n- Lucky Lottery Numbers - [Who doesn't play the lottery?  I mean... free money, right?!]\n- Famous Citations - [Because everyone needs some inspirational quotes every now and then]\n- Definition of a Complex Word - [Education is important! Anyone would want to expand his vocabulary]\n- Fake Stock Exchange Alert - [These are total random companies symbols and values. Not real data to be sued in the stock market!]\n\n+ DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS (showing that you are monitoring the device, will discourage people from accessing it)\n- Custom Message - [You choose what appears on the notification]\n- \"Device locked at: #current date and time#\" - [Shows the time of the last screen lock]\n- \"Access to this device is monitored. Unique notification ID: #securityID#\" \n\n*** PRO OPTIONS ***\nImprove your stealthiness with these advanced options\n\n- Secret Lock -> Launch iAmNotified without anyone near you noticing. When the option is activated, a black dimmed screen is shown when the app is opened, simulating the lock screen. Now you can secretly press the lock button to lock the screen, or wait for it to lock automatically. To access the app with the option activated, simply tap anywhere on the black screen.\n\n- Random Notification Time -> The notification appears at a random time within 2 minutes from the screen lock, instead of immediately after\n\nStart to feel in control of your device!"

      "label": "Anyone can make their own tunes in Forza. It comes down to doing the right math, taking a test drive and knowing when to make a few adjustments. Nothing magic. ForzaTune Pro does the complex math for you, and makes it easy to adjust the car to your driving style and skill.\n\nTell ForzaTune you're driving a Supra on the streets of Mexico, and it creates a tune to match. If you prefer a more aggressive or more stable feel, then open up the tune customizer to set oversteer or understeer in each part of a turn. ForzaTune works out the new values for you automatically.\n\nThere's nothing better than driving a car dialed in how you want it. And a car that feels planted lets you drive faster.\n\nThis Pro version includes many extra tuning types like rally, drag and drift plus gearing options, the ability to save tunes, and finer control over your tune balance.\n\nHere are the complete specs if you'd like to learn more:\n\nONE APP TO TUNE THEM ALL\nForzaTune Pro has support for Forza Horizon 5, Forza Horizon 4, Forza Motorsport 7 and also includes most vehicles in Forza Horizon 3 and Forza Motorsport 6.\n\nMAKE STREET, DRIFT, RALLY TUNES AND MORE\nNo matter what kind of driving you like, this tuning app has you covered. Create standard (street/track), drift, drag, rain, rally/snow, and off-road tunes with ease.\n\nLEARN HOW TO QUICKLY FINE-TUNE\nAdjust the overall balance, turn entry balance, turn exit balance, ride stiffness, roll stiffness in seconds.\n\nRETUNE GEARS WITH EASE\nIncludes a gearing calculator option that lets you match race transmission values to engine swaps or major power upgrades. \n\nTUNES ARE TAILORED TO EACH CAR\n1140+ vehicles covering Forza Horizon 5 back through Forza Motorsport 6. Tuning for some special editions (F&F, Team Forza, FE) is done with the base car unless noted otherwise. ForzaTune does not include oval racing vehicles or tuning.\n\nACCURATE FORMULAS\nForzaTune Pro combines your input with its vehicle and track databases to create original, balanced tunes. Formulas are based on real race engineering. They are also tested extensively with a gamepad and steering wheel/pedal set.\n\nSAVE AND MANAGE YOUR TUNES\nSave, edit, search and backup all of your tunes. Export and import options let you transfer your tunes to new devices or friends easily without logins or accounts.\n\n-----\nFAQs\n-----\nQ: Is this for beginners or experienced tuners?\nA: Both. Experienced tuners use it to save time. Newer tuners use it to learn how to tune.\n\nQ: How do I use the app?\nA: Copy several car details from the game into ForzaTune, hit \"Next\" and copy the results into the tuning menu in Forza Horizon 5 or an earlier Forza title. There is also a series of video tutorials on YouTube to get you started.\n\nQ: What settings and upgrades do I need?\nA: You will need racing upgrades like suspension, braking, anti-roll bars, and differential to change the values in the tuning menu. You can also use drift, rally and adjustable stock suspensions when available (like off-road buggies and some trucks in Horizon). You will also have the best results if you disable stability management (STM) and traction control (TCS) for lower class cars. Normal or simulation steering is fine, but simulation steering is recommended in FH5 especially when fine-tuning.\n\nQ: Why is tuning your cars important?\nA: When doing upgrades many of the default tune settings will not match the new build. ForzaTune brings it back to a balanced setup. Also, tuning doesn't affect your PI or race restrictions—so this is how you can gain an advantage over other racers.\n\n---\nMake better tunes faster with ForzaTune Pro."

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

It displays a frequency diagram of the watch and measures rate, beat error, amplitude and beats per hour.\n\n The application uses the build-in or headset's microphone to record audible ticks of the watch.  \n\nUse this application in a quiet environment. Any ambient noise can affect result accuracy. Complete silence is the best however noise cancelling algorithm can help to eliminate not very loud sounds.The recommended way to record the ticks is to touch the crown of the watch with the headset (earplugs) microphone.\n\nIf you don't need the frequency diagram, look at Watch Tuner app.\nIf you want to test only the rate accuracy, try Watch Tuner Lite.\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or any troubles using this app - don't hesitate to write me."

To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the time from an atomic time server.\n\nWe are proud to offer version 5 of the Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock. The program is one of the classic applications since the early days of the Apple App Store and has been continually improved based on user feedback.\n\nThe Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock shows the precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the ultimate precise time from cesium atomic clocks available on the internet, or any other time server you like.\n\nThe graphical display mimics the clock display of the legendary Gorgy Timing clocks, which are used in professional radio and television studios, and we spent much effort to bring the original feeling of these wickedly expensive clocks to your iPhone. This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. \n\nVersion 5 contains the following functions:\n\n* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all of the latest iPads and iPads Pro)\n* Optimized for iOS 13 and watchOS 6, full 64 bit support\n* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays\n* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)\n* Local time / UTC time mode\n* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background\n* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds\n* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments\n* Customizable time server sources\n* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, dark green, violet, pink, orange, turquoise and hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments\n* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)\n* 12/24 hours display\n* Optional second tick sound\n* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)\n* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out\n* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)\n* Disabled screen auto-lock\n* Options \"sync at startup\", \"hourly\", \"daily\", or a sync button for manual syncing\n* The last known time delta is used when started without sync\n* \"Night mode\", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery\n* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes\n* VoiceOver support\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\n* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.\n* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), and do not lock your device. Be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, connect it to your charger, or use the app's Night mode, which is much more energy-saving."

Turning your iPhone or iPad into a multi functional measuring device with: metronome, stopwatch, timer, seismometer, ruler, surface level and many more.\n\nCurrently, there are 13 measuring tools + Flashlight in the tool box:\n\n- BAROMETER\nIt gives you a nice and clear local atmospheric pressure, obtained from the barometric sensor in your device\n\n- ALTIMETER\nThis tool takes advantage of the built in GPS to give you the precise elevation above the sea level.\n\n- COMPASS\nA pretty and well-made compass for navigation, traveling and direction reference purposes.\n\n- TESLAMETER\nIt takes advantage of the built-in magnetometer in your iPhone/iPod touch, allows you to monitor the strength of magnetic field all around. There are a range of real-life applications for this useful item, such as: metal detector, AC magnetic fields, or finding low-magnetic places for sleeping\n\n- METRONOME\nIt is the most precise and stable metronome on the app store. Whether you are a musician, a music teacher, a beginner at playing music or even a golfer, this tool provides you a set of powerful features that can satisfy all your needs. \n\n- STOPWATCH\nWhenever you need a precise and professional stopwatch for sport activities like: sprints, jogging, this tool is a must have. Among its features are: intuitive interface, lap and split modes support, or send log results to your email\n\n- TIMER\nThere are unlimited applications of using timer in daily life, such as: egg timer, tea timer, cooking, alarm clock, etc. The timer tool satisfies all of those needs by many of its features: up to 5 timers running simultaneously, count down and count up support, intuitive and convenient duration setup using preset and gestures\n\n- SEISMOMETER\nTaking advantage of the built-in accelerometer in your iPhone, this tool detects and visualizes any vibrations and moves of the iPhone. So, why not using this excellent feature to help your iPhone self-protected like a car when combined with an alarm? Or another great application is to test how smooth the car is on a test drive\n\n- PLUMB BOB\nThis is an instrument to check if an object is perfectly vertical/plumb and has been used since the time of the ancient Egyptians. It suits any types of your needs, such as: hanging objects, carpenter work, brick layer or building construction\n\n- SURFACE LEVEL\nThis tool facilitates the measurement of the slope of whatever surface you want to check. Most importantly, its accuracy is ensured at the maximum level by the support to different sensitivities that allow you to detect subtle slopes (floor leveling, furniture arrangement,..)\n\n- SPIRIT/BUBBLE LEVEL\nIt is a simple but extremely useful tool in the set to check if an object is balanced. Its applications range from entertained purposes such as checking pool billiard tables in the bar to serious usages like constructions, carpenter, etc\n\n- RULER\nThe ruler helps you precisely know the lengths of objects all around you, such as pens, tables, pictures. We built it to become even more than just a normal ruler: longest distance measuring capability, and up to 6 units support\n\n- PROTRACTOR\nHave you ever forgotten your protractor at school or when you urgently look for a protractor to measure any kind of angles in real life?"

      "label": "Sunnytrack transforms your device into a professional tool for planning sunlight, the sun’s position, path and shadows for every place in the world (and at every time) accurately, on the map or in AR. Whether for photography, real estate, your new flat or house, gardening, photovoltaics or all outdoor activities: sunlight, sun position and shadows play a major role. See sun’s elevation, its direction, exact sun movement over day and year, objects’ shadows, shadow lengths, shadow differences between seasons, and more.\n\nRECOMMENDED BY PROFESSIONALS:\n\n„This app is awesome! It has helped me to align the PV modules (solar panels) optimally.“ – Jürgen\n\n„For me as a photographer Sunnytrack is an extremely practical tool. Always knowing the sun’s position in real time brings enormous relief. Planning photo shootings becomes significantly easier.“ – Aki from Akigrafie Live\n\n„I am absolutely thrilled. I work in the real estate industry and can now use AR to check with my clients when the sun is shining on the balcony. Amazed customers guaranteed.“ – Toni K.\n\n„It's very useful and professional. It helps me coordinate my trips.“ – Dino\n\nPHILOSOPHY: No ads. No user tracking. Sunnytrack tracks the sun, but only the sun, not the user! For sure. This app is a professional product. It can be bought for a one-time price to get all the high quality features it offers at once, without distracting ads or the need for further in app purchases.\n\n• CREATORS (in photography/filming) all over the world love Sunnytrack not only for its easy usage but also for the extensive functionality it offers. With it you're guaranteed to not miss a perfect scene and optimal light – during the day, Golden Hour or Blue Hour, for instance. Precise, location-dependent planning of the sun’s position and natural lighting of your subjects are extremely relevant in photography – whether capturing landscapes, objects or humans.\n\n• You would like to know the effective AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT a flat or house/property offers? During Winter, when days are shorter? Get a general picture in advance on Maps or impress at site visits and property tours with showing the sun’s path at the kitchen window for the whole year, live in 3D in your camera image using Augmented Reality (AR)! It’s an insiders’ tip for real estate agents, house builders or interested individuals in general.\n\n• PHOTOVOLTAICS: Sunnytrack provides professional support in placing, adjusting and optimizing your solar modules. Where does sun rise, where does it set? See the differences between the seasons at your location.\n\n• We love green! We love GARDENS. Plan your garden with Sunnytrack. Simulate the exact shadows of multiple objects in Shadow Simulation mode, by adding them on the map defining their heights. For example, you can see the length and impact of shadows casted by objects like houses or a trees when the sun follows its path.\n\n• SAVE all planned scenes, sun paths, shadow simulations and your places for later use.\n\n• As you can see in the screenshots, DAY VIEW provides precise, location-dependent information on the sun like day length, solar noon, sunrise, sunset and twilight times (like Blue Hour, Golden Hour, Astronomical Twilight, …)\n\n• For all OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES Sunnytrack wants to be your faithful companion as a sun tracker and planner. Whether in cities, in the mountains or when touring through valleys, meadows and fields, the app develops its full potential: on Maps, live in AR or even in advance when planning.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nIdeas and feedback are very welcome. Please use the provided feedback function in the app.\n\nAR 3D functionality: Sunnytrack shows the sun’s position and path based on the orientation of your device with high precision. For identifying its orientation, your devices’ internal sensors are used. In order to achieve exact results, a calibration can be required by moving your device in a figure-eight-pattern and keeping it away of metallic objects."

      "label": "Rowmote lets you seamlessly control audio, video, and presentation applications on your Mac from your iOS device.\n\nYou love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.\n\nOr, your Mac didn’t come with a remote control or doesn’t even have an infrared port. Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality. \n\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\n\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n- Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n- Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser...): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n- Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater... \n- For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n- Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n- Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note: \n- you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n- the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n- no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n- The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n- The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n- you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation."

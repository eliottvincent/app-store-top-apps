Parents will also be able to use this app to stay updated on school’s programme and activities. \n\nThe mobile app is currently only available for mainstream MOE Kindergartens, Primary schools, Secondary schools and Junior Colleges/Centralised Institute.\n\nWe appreciate if you can share with us your feedback to help MOE enhance and improve the experience, benefiting more parents in future.\n\n[Note]\n- If you choose to log out of Parents Gateway, you will stop receiving notifications for new announcements and consent forms until your next log-in.\n\n- The Parents Gateway app uses Singpass to identify parents of students in MOE schools. Singpass is only used to identify and authenticate the parent. The Singpass ID and the password will not be stored in the app. Upon successful authentication, the connection to Singpass will be terminated and the login will henceforth be managed by the Parents Gateway app. There is no risk of Singpass credentials being stolen if a user stays logged in."

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go.

They'll enter their spaceship and travel through space to explore the Moon and planets. As they gather every discovery from their mission into story reports, the secrets of the planets will be revealed!\r\n\r\nAugmented Reality with the Family\r\nUse the 3D scan to bring Santa and his friends to life in AR! When your children speak, their characters will repeat their words with different voices while being surrounded by AR environments. They can also virtually feed their animal characters and guess which foods they like the most.\r\nAn extended AR mask collection offers more frames and stickers for this winter including some with Christmas decorations such as twinkling lights or snowflakes so your kids can embody their heroes and create magic AR stories to share with the family!\r\n\r\nKid Games and Activities\r\nApplaydu stimulates the creativity of children and enhances different areas of development by covering various topics that are appropriate for kids, such as numbers, colors, vocabulary, geography, and the planets. There are many gameplay types, such as racing, drawing with Santa, going on animal adventures with Natoons, and even multiplayer mini-games that provide the perfect challenge for kids aged 4 to 9!\r\nSeason 3 brings an extra set of activities! Let your children discover over 30 English vocabulary words with the vocabulary game Word Explorer, and go on a mission to travel to six countries with the Travel Around the World experience.\r\n\r\nParental Controls for a 100% Kid-Friendly Experience\r\nSupervise your child’s experience through a dedicated parental section accessible from the kid’s bedroom that keeps track of their progress.

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

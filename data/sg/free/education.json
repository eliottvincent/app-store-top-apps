Singpass is only used to identify and authenticate the parent. The Singpass ID and the password will not be stored in the app. Upon successful authentication, the connection to Singpass will be terminated and the login will henceforth be managed by the Parents Gateway app. There is no risk of Singpass credentials being stolen if a user stays logged in."

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

      "label": "◉ Let Mirinae be your AI Korean Teacher!\nYou enter a Korean sentence and Mirinae will translate the sentence, show you all the individual parts of speech, find and explain any grammar patterns present, explain the particles and honorifics and verb conjugations, identify & explain any idioms or neologisms used, and draw out a parse-tree showing all the individual phrases & clauses in the sentence.\n\nClick on anything in the explanation for more details, alternate word definitions, example uses, related patterns, cross-references to learning sites and major textbooks, and much more..\n\nAll this allows the learner to explore Korean wherever they encounter it, perhaps an example sentence in a dictionary or lesson text, some song lyrics or drama dialog, etc., and interactively discover its meaning, syntax, grammar patterns and any idioms used, and then to explore and continue learning, finding other examples of the patterns and words used.\n\n◉ Learn while watching Kdrama or browsing the web\nThere is also a Chrome Extension version that lets you explore and learn from Korean text you encounter on any website, including Kdrama subtitles on streaming sites like Viki.com, Netflix and Youtube.\n\nWhen enabled, the Mirinae extension will detect Korean on any web-page, so you can explore and get a deep understanding of any Korean directly within the page so that it can be very easily used to augment existing Korean teaching, reference and translation sites and video streaming sites. Visit the Chrome Store and search for “Mirinae”.\n\n◉ Built-in Dictionary, Searchable Grammar & Idiom Reference and Grammar-term Glossary\nMirinae has a built-in dictionary & searchable grammar reference and can also be used as a deep, interactive Korean reference that is driven by examples of the things you want to search for.    The library has a large and growing number of idiom patterns and neologisms (newly-coined words), essential for understanding modern spoken Korean, Kpop lyrics and Kdrama dialog.\n\n◉ High tech!!\nMirinae uses advanced machine learning, natural language processing and a non-deterministic phrase-structure parser, coupled with a proprietary regular-expression grammar-pattern, idiom and neologism library to build a lexical and grammatical analysis of the text, showing a breakdown of the text into its component words and particles and suffixes and other parts-of-speech along with a display of its structure in terms of phrases and predicates and clauses.\n\nIt also uses an advanced, bi-language embedding-vector meaning disambiguator to provide likely meanings for individual words in the sentence, which is not easily determined from a full sentence-translation, as you might get from a standard translation site.\n\n◉ User quotes:\n• “WHERE HAS THIS BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE\nAs someone who prefers to Korean deconstruct a sentence in order to learn how to put it together this is PERFECT!”\n\n• “I’ve been searching for something like this for a while now so this is amazing. Korean grammar is my weakest subject so this is beyond helpful. Thank you so, so much!”\n\n◉ FAQ\n•How to use Mirinae?\nVisit https://mirinae.io/#/support \n\n◉ NOTE\n• If you have any questions or suggestions please contact us:\n  - helpdesk: team@mirinae.io\n  - website: https://mirinae.io\n  - privacy policy: https://company.mirinae.io/privacy-policy/\n  - terms of use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n  - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mirinae.io/\n  - twitter: https://twitter.com/mirinae_io\n  - youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/mirinae_io"

Fast forward to year 1959, the school was renamed as Montfort School and then segregated to form Montfort Secondary School and Montfort Junior School in 1974.\r\n\nIn 2016, the esteemed school celebrated its 100th anniversary and launched its coffee table book for the auspicious occasion. It is thus apt that Montfort Secondary School would now wish to further promote the continuity of interest in its rich heritage by developing a special mobile in-app trail called, Montfort Schools .\n\nThis app captures the history of Montfort Secondary School and the neighborhood it is located in. It serves:\n\n- To cultivate the interest in the understanding of Hougang and Punggol’s heritage and society.\n- To develop a better understanding of Singapore’s history and challenges in the globalizing world.\n- To provide a recreational and educational experience for the students and residents of the area.\n- To instil in our students, a better understanding and appreciation of the School’s heritage.\n- Create a sense of identity among our students to school and the neighborhood."

Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

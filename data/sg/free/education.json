      "label": "◉ Let Mirinae be your AI Korean Teacher!\nYou enter a Korean sentence and Mirinae will translate the sentence, show you all the individual parts of speech, find and explain any grammar patterns present, explain the particles and honorifics and verb conjugations, identify & explain any idioms or neologisms used, and draw out a parse-tree showing all the individual phrases & clauses in the sentence.\n\nClick on anything in the explanation for more details, alternate word definitions, example uses, related patterns, cross-references to learning sites and major textbooks, and much more..\n\nAll this allows the learner to explore Korean wherever they encounter it, perhaps an example sentence in a dictionary or lesson text, some song lyrics or drama dialog, etc., and interactively discover its meaning, syntax, grammar patterns and any idioms used, and then to explore and continue learning, finding other examples of the patterns and words used.\n\n◉ Learn while watching Kdrama or browsing the web\nThere is also a Chrome Extension version that lets you explore and learn from Korean text you encounter on any website, including Kdrama subtitles on streaming sites like Viki.com, Netflix and Youtube.\n\nWhen enabled, the Mirinae extension will detect Korean on any web-page, so you can explore and get a deep understanding of any Korean directly within the page so that it can be very easily used to augment existing Korean teaching, reference and translation sites and video streaming sites. Visit the Chrome Store and search for “Mirinae”.\n\n◉ Built-in Dictionary, Searchable Grammar & Idiom Reference and Grammar-term Glossary\nMirinae has a built-in dictionary & searchable grammar reference and can also be used as a deep, interactive Korean reference that is driven by examples of the things you want to search for.    The library has a large and growing number of idiom patterns and neologisms (newly-coined words), essential for understanding modern spoken Korean, Kpop lyrics and Kdrama dialog.\n\n◉ High tech!!\nMirinae uses advanced machine learning, natural language processing and a non-deterministic phrase-structure parser, coupled with a proprietary regular-expression grammar-pattern, idiom and neologism library to build a lexical and grammatical analysis of the text, showing a breakdown of the text into its component words and particles and suffixes and other parts-of-speech along with a display of its structure in terms of phrases and predicates and clauses.\n\nIt also uses an advanced, bi-language embedding-vector meaning disambiguator to provide likely meanings for individual words in the sentence, which is not easily determined from a full sentence-translation, as you might get from a standard translation site.\n\n◉ User quotes:\n• “WHERE HAS THIS BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE\nAs someone who prefers to Korean deconstruct a sentence in order to learn how to put it together this is PERFECT!”\n\n• “I’ve been searching for something like this for a while now so this is amazing. Korean grammar is my weakest subject so this is beyond helpful. Thank you so, so much!”\n\n◉ FAQ\n•How to use Mirinae?\nVisit https://mirinae.io/#/support \n\n◉ NOTE\n• If you have any questions or suggestions please contact us:\n  - helpdesk: team@mirinae.io\n  - website: https://mirinae.io\n  - privacy policy: https://company.mirinae.io/privacy-policy/\n  - terms of use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n  - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mirinae.io/\n  - twitter: https://twitter.com/mirinae_io\n  - youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/mirinae_io"

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

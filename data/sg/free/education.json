Singpass is only used to identify and authenticate the parent. The Singpass ID and the password will not be stored in the app. Upon successful authentication, the connection to Singpass will be terminated and the login will henceforth be managed by the Parents Gateway app. There is no risk of Singpass credentials being stolen if a user stays logged in."

It has been designed to offer parents a quick and easy channel for keeping up-to-date with their son or daughter’s performance and any relevant school information, including last minute calendar notifications or event invites. It is aimed at enhancing the information flow from your school/teachers to parents ensuring greater engagement between all parties.\n\nThe iParent app offers parents a useful and configurable dashboard where they are able to view information and activities about all children at the school. Quick links are provided for:\n\nThe timetable of each child\nInformation about any sanctions and rewards\nSchool news and bulletins\nThe school calendar\nThe photo galleries\n\nMore detailed information can then be located about the following:\n\nTeaching groups\nThe school timetable\nInternal exam details (entries, timetables, results)\nExternal exam details (entries, timetables, arrangements, candidate details, results)\nSchool reports and assessments\nAttendance\nActivities\nDetentions\nReward and conduct details\n\nParents can use the app to view and subscribe to your school communications including emails, SMS messages and push notifications to the app. Push notifications will advise parents about any timely updates for each child, including information such as recently released reports or exam results, any rewards or detentions and pastoral records.\n\nThey can also view the contacts linked with their child and request changes to any contact details, thereby ensuring the data is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nAs with the iStudent app, there is full access to all school news and bulletins (both current and archived news), the school calendar and the school directory.\n\nThe data used by the iSAMS Parent app is encrypted to ensure that confidential information cannot be accessed by unauthorised personnel. Your school also controls the level of visibility of information and communication subscriptions offered to parents.\n\nPlease note: The iSAMS Parent app must be installed by your school in order for it to be accessible to parents. It will only work as part of the iSAMS management information system and Parent Portal."

You will be able to schedule home care visits with your doctor and his/her trusted providers. Soon you will also be able to buy products that your doctor has curated and screened for you. The key is trust.\n\nAppointment bookings are secure and in real time. Your trusted doctor’s available time slots can be viewed from the app and you can choose the date, time and location to suit your convenience. Booking can be done 24/7 anytime, anywhere. You will receive reminders of your upcoming appointments and can view previous appointments. Reschedule or cancel your appointments through the app (within specified time limits). \n\nChat with your trusted doctor. Maybe you have a quick question that doesn’t need a trip down to the doctor. Your trusted doctor knows you and your medical history. He or she will be the best person to give you advice. With MaNaDr, you can quickly open a chat or a video consult with your trusted doctor. At the end of the chat, get a summary report from your doctor.\n\nNeed a home visit? Not just a doctor’s visit, but perhaps for nursing care, physiotherapy or other home care services? Look for your trusted doctor’s home care provider and book an appointment directly.\n\nChildren and the elderly without mobile devices are not left out. Add them as your family or friends and book appointments on their behalf.\n\nMaNaDr aims to be the one app for you and your family’s healthcare needs, from infancy to the golden years. For now, we connect you to your trusted healthcare provider but there will be much more to come. Stay tuned!\n\nYour healthcare data is secure.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more!

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

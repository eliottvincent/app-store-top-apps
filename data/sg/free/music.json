Tuner T1 also comes with a handy Tone Generator that plays any musical note as a ​reference for tuning. A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning)."

      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

It is so accurate that it will be your best friend for guitar intonation!\n\nBecause Pro Guitar Tuner is chromatic you can tune most types of stringed instruments. \n\nHigh-quality samples of real instruments are also accessible (i.e. tune by ear if preferred!). A massive library of different tunings for guitar, bass, balalaika, violin, ukulele and more makes it easy to find more qualities and characteristics from your instrument. \n\nThe interface:\nTo make it more intuitive, we give you information about the current pitch in many different ways:\n\n*Cents for the current pitch\n*A red/green light indicating the closest pitch\n*A note wheel corresponding to the chromatic scale\n*A fretboard with the current tuning setting displayed\n\nStandard guitar is set as default but the guitar tuner can be used to tune many different instruments, such as: \n*Guitars - Standard, 4-string, 5-string, 7-string, 8-string\n, 9-string, 10-string, 11-string, 12-string, and 13-string guitar\n*Bass guitars - Standard, 5-string bass and 6-string bass\n*Ukuleles - std (Soprano), Pocket, Concert, Tenor, Baritone, Bass, and Contrabass\n*Banjo - 4-string, 5-string, 6-string\n*Mandolin family - Mandolin (Soprano), Piccolo, Mandola (alto), Octave Mandolin (tenor), Mandocello (Baritone), Mandobass, Irish Bouzouki, Cittern, and Greek Bouzouki\n*Violin family - Violin, Viola, Cello (violoncello), Double bass and 5-string Double bass\n*Balalaika family - Prima, Piccolo, Secunda, Alto, Tenor, Bass and Contrabass\n\nAfter you have selected an instrument you choose a specific tuning. The app provides you with over 200 custom tunings.\n\nThe tuning options are divided into groups to make them easier to find. For guitar, the categories are:\n*General tunings\n*Raised tunings\n*Lowered tunings\n*Dropped tunings\n*Double dropped tunings\n*Major open tunings\n*Minor open tunings (cross-note)\n*Modal tunings\n*Miscellaneous tunings\n\nIf you have certain tunings that you often use, you can save them as favorites. This gives you easy access to them under favorite tunings.\n\nIn the app, you can choose to subscribe to Pro Guitar Tuner Premium. It´s  a monthly subscription that gives you the following features: \n\n*No Ads\n*All Tunings\n*All Instruments\n*Extra Settings\n\nIf you choose to purchase a monthly subscription, after your confirmation, the subscription will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period.

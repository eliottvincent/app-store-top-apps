Tuner T1 also comes with a handy Tone Generator that plays any musical note as a ​reference for tuning. A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning)."

It is so accurate that it will be your best friend for guitar intonation!\n\nBecause Pro Guitar Tuner is chromatic you can tune most types of stringed instruments. \n\nHigh-quality samples of real instruments are also accessible (i.e. tune by ear if preferred!). A massive library of different tunings for guitar, bass, balalaika, violin, ukulele and more makes it easy to find more qualities and characteristics from your instrument. \n\nThe interface:\nTo make it more intuitive, we give you information about the current pitch in many different ways:\n\n*Cents for the current pitch\n*A red/green light indicating the closest pitch\n*A note wheel corresponding to the chromatic scale\n*A fretboard with the current tuning setting displayed\n\nStandard guitar is set as default but the guitar tuner can be used to tune many different instruments, such as: \n*Guitars - Standard, 4-string, 5-string, 7-string, 8-string\n, 9-string, 10-string, 11-string, 12-string, and 13-string guitar\n*Bass guitars - Standard, 5-string bass and 6-string bass\n*Ukuleles - std (Soprano), Pocket, Concert, Tenor, Baritone, Bass, and Contrabass\n*Banjo - 4-string, 5-string, 6-string\n*Mandolin family - Mandolin (Soprano), Piccolo, Mandola (alto), Octave Mandolin (tenor), Mandocello (Baritone), Mandobass, Irish Bouzouki, Cittern, and Greek Bouzouki\n*Violin family - Violin, Viola, Cello (violoncello), Double bass and 5-string Double bass\n*Balalaika family - Prima, Piccolo, Secunda, Alto, Tenor, Bass and Contrabass\n\nAfter you have selected an instrument you choose a specific tuning. The app provides you with over 200 custom tunings.\n\nThe tuning options are divided into groups to make them easier to find. For guitar, the categories are:\n*General tunings\n*Raised tunings\n*Lowered tunings\n*Dropped tunings\n*Double dropped tunings\n*Major open tunings\n*Minor open tunings (cross-note)\n*Modal tunings\n*Miscellaneous tunings\n\nIf you have certain tunings that you often use, you can save them as favorites. This gives you easy access to them under favorite tunings.\n\nIn the app, you can choose to subscribe to Pro Guitar Tuner Premium. It´s  a monthly subscription that gives you the following features: \n\n*No Ads\n*All Tunings\n*All Instruments\n*Extra Settings\n\nIf you choose to purchase a monthly subscription, after your confirmation, the subscription will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

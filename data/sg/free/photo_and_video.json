Don't spend $7 at a photo booth or 7 hours with your digital camera and photo editing tools — just use this app to take a perfectly cropped picture that you can submit online to ICA. \n\nIf you need printed copies, you can order them from within the app! No need to leave the house — we'll send them to you in a few days. (Singapore only!)\n\nFEATURES\n• Works on iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch with camera\n• It's super easy! Just line yourself up with the guides to make sure you’re framed correctly\n• Take your own picture (for devices with front-facing cameras), or have someone else take it for you\n• A countdown timer to help you prepare for the shot. You can disable this countdown timer to take photos of fast-moving objects like children, pets, and the cost of living in Singapore.\n• If you send a photo of your pet to ICA, please don't say we suggested it.\n• Take as many pictures as you want, to get that perfect shot for your NRIC/passport\n• Your photo is automatically cropped and resized for ICA's specifications for NRIC/passport photos (400 x 514px)\n• Email it to yourself, or save it to your Camera Roll, so you can finish your online application later\n• Free!\n• OR you can ask us to print it for you. That's not free.\n• With the guides, you won’t get a letter from ICA that telling you to \"show more shoulder\" in your photo. We’re not kidding, this actually happened to one of us\n• Share your ID photo to Twitter or Facebook after saving or emailing it! We don't know why you'd want to do this, but you can.\n• Did we mention it’s free?\n• Why are you still reading this, we’ve run out of features\n\nPRINTED PHOTOS\n• Order printed IC photos, mailed to you in a few days. \n• Cheaper and more convenient than photo booths, because you don't even need to leave the house. Unless you stay in a photo booth, in which case, umm, sure, you win.\n• Perfect for attaching to job application forms, and as gifts. Really, really terrible gifts. \n• Pay by PayPal or credit card.\n\nIf you get an error that says \"Saving failed with error: data unavailable\", you have to allow IC Photo access to the Camera Roll. Do this:\n• Go to the iPhone or iPad's Settings\n• Tap on Privacy, then Photos. \n• Look for IC Photo, and make sure the toggle is \"On\"\n• We need access to your Camera Roll to save to it. Don't worry, we don't do anything with your photos.\n\nIf you have questions or suggestions, please email icphoto@tinkertanker.com. Thanks!"

As well as passport photos, this app is ideal for printing photos for job applications. More than ten popular formats for job application photos have also been predefined.\n\nThis app can store, print, share or email multiple passport photos on photo paper. The resulting images can be printed directly, or ordered later (not from the app) from the photo lab of your choice on the Internet.\n\nTo produce the passport photos, a photo can be taken from the camera or loaded from the album. The next step is to adjust the picture by multi-touch gestures with your fingers (position, zoom and rotation).\n\nPhoto paper (cm): 9x13, 10x13, 10x15, 11x15, 13x18, single image (selected size)\n\nPhoto paper (inch): 3½x5¼, 4x5¼, 4x6, 4½x6, 5x7, single image (selected size)\n\nThis app supports printing on an AirPrint-compatible printer. The print size can be adjusted in the app if needed. The passport photo will be automatically printed slightly larger in order to facilitate cutting it out.\n\nThe app already provides passport photo templates for the following countries:\nAlbania, Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam\n\nWe do not accept any liability for the correctness, accuracy, or up-to-dateness of the passport photo templates.

In particular, make sure that the shot you take is correct and meets the current regulations."

      "label": "Watch any web video and your personal photos, videos & music on your Chromecast or Google Cast powered TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen. \n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> UPGRADE FEATURES (available as in-app purchases)\n\n* Premium Edition: Unlocks all of the features listed here. Also future features are included, so you do not have to pay for them when they are released in an updated app version. \n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker: Blocks ads & popups on most websites and removes the sponsoring ads from the app. You can update and enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!! And you designed it work easily and quickly\"\nRyan, England\n\n“I looooove your app. It has taken my Chromecast to a whole new level.”\nRosalind Romero, USA\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here.

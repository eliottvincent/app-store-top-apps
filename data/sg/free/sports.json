More referrals, more credits!\n\nHandicap index:\n- Deemples currently uses the USGA handicap formula and is not recognised or an official handicap of any golf club.\n- Golfers use the Deemples handicap because the scores used to calculate the handicap cannot be submitted by them.\n- This requires 2 other golfers in the Deemples game to submit the same adjusted gross score, course rating, and slope rating for the golfer in order for it to count for handicapping purposes.\n- This submission method makes it the most trusted and non-manipulable golf handicap.\n- The Deemples handicap will be moving to the World Handicap System in due time.\n\nWhat if I'm new to golf：\n- Join any 1-1 or group beginner lessons on the app.\n- There are lots of beginner-friendly golf games for you to join if you want to get on the golf course.\n\nMarkets supported:\nDeemples is currently available in Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Australia and Malaysia.

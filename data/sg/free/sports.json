No problem! With the SailGP app you can compare two teams together at the same time. You’ll be able to monitor the data, speed and performance of both boats, side by side, all on one screen.\n\nNO SPOILER MODE\nAs SailGP operates across multiple time zones, you have the option to turn off spoilers and hide all results until you have watched the race.\n\nAWARD WINNING SAILING APP\nSailGP has won multiple awards for it’s impressive technology and groundbreaking movements within the sporting and technology communities.

      "label": "Play badminton more effectively with a perfectly strung badminton racket! The stringster app measures the tension level of your strings by their sound. This helps you:\n\n - to check your stringer’s performance\n - to monitor the loss of tension over the course of time\n - to identify the appropriate point of time for new strings\n\nWhy is this so important? When the strings wear out, the precision and the touch of the racket get lost – just as a racing car’s wheels start spinning when its tires are worn out.\n\nPlaying your badminton racket with fresh strings has many advantages:\n\n - higher repulsion power for longer clears and faster smashes\n - better feel for the ball and more controled hits\n - better shock-damping performance for joint-protection at arm and shoulder"

Do you like to walk, run, cycle, and have fun as a team? And are you good at using your brain and taking quizzes?\nWhether you’re a beginner or an expert on CSR issues, whether you like to exercise or interact with your environment, GO Safran is for you! This app has only one goal: to have fun and learn new things while acting responsibly, together. \n\nWHAT IS CSR?\nAt Safran, there are four CSR pillars: \n-        Working towards carbon-free aviation \n-        Being an exemplary employer\n-        Being a role model for responsible industry\n-        Demonstrating our civic commitment \nThis CSR policy is a shared commitment, because we are all affected by social, societal, and environmental issues: at work, as citizens, or simply as human beings. \nAnd with GO Safran, you can discover these commitments and help make them a reality every day!\n\n\nEXERCISE, TAKE CHALLENGES, AND ANSWER QUIZZES \nGO Safran is an app that lets you and your team take care of yourselves, your colleagues, and the planet! \nLog in with your work email to create or join a team of Safran colleagues, anywhere in the world. \nWhether you’re a great athlete, a quiz expert, or always ready to try something new, you can earn points at any time! Every kilometer traveled by your team members, every correct answer on the quizzes, and every completed photo challenge is converted into points and counts toward the final victory. But that’s not all! You can also encourage your teammates in the app’s built-in chat and boost their performance with daily points!\n\nBUILD YOUR TEAM SPIRIT AND MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP!\nThroughout the contest, the best teams are rewarded with medals. Their rankings will change over the course of the event, which is divided into four seasons. 1 season = 1 Group CSR commitment. At the end of each season, the Group’s three best teams and three other teams drawn at random will be rewarded! \n\nBENEFITS\nWith its user-friendly features, the GO Safran application is easy to pick up.\nThe “decarbonizer” mode calculates the CO2 emissions you save when you switch to a new mode of transport for your commute. Quizzes and challenges are easily accessible from the home page, and a blog will tell you more about the Group’s CSR commitments... as well as lots of tips and tricks that can easily be applied to your everyday life. \nYou can also exchange private or team messages with your colleagues to motivate each other, and can view statistics for all your activities.\nFinally, an overall ranking is given to show you the position of your team.\n\nSO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? DOWNLOAD THE APP NOW! \n\nSafran is an international high-technology group operating in the aviation (propulsion, equipment and interiors), defense and space markets.

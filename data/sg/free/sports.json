      "label": "Deemples is an all-in-one golf app that allows you to book your games (games/competitions/lessons), meet new golfers, pay in advance, and find the best rates online.\n\nEasy golf booking & find golf buddies:\n- Join any of the games available in your area in the app.\n- If nothing fits, you can create your own golf game and invite other players to play.\n- Why play alone/with the same few friends, when you can expand your network with Deemples?\n\nOnline payment & cheaper golf rates:\n- Golf courses and game hosts can accept online payments and secure your golf bookings.\n- Rates are usually cheaper than paying at the counter. (Currently only available in Malaysia)\n\nEarn Deemples credits for your next game:\n- Get instant cashback when you book and pay for your game.\n- Refer a friend and you'll get RM20 when they book and pay for their first game. More referrals, more credits!\n\nHandicap index:\n- Deemples currently uses the USGA handicap formula and is not recognised or an official handicap of any golf club.\n- Golfers use the Deemples handicap because the scores used to calculate the handicap cannot be submitted by them.\n- This requires 2 other golfers in the Deemples game to submit the same adjusted gross score, course rating, and slope rating for the golfer in order for it to count for handicapping purposes.\n- This submission method makes it the most trusted and non-manipulable golf handicap.\n- The Deemples handicap will be moving to the World Handicap System in due time.\n\nWhat if I'm new to golf：\n- Join any 1-1 or group beginner lessons on the app.\n- There are lots of beginner-friendly golf games for you to join if you want to get on the golf course.\n\nMarkets supported:\nDeemples is currently available in Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Australia and Malaysia. More countries coming soon.\n\nThe team:\nWe're a small and passionate team with the goal of helping golfers golf more anytime, anywhere.

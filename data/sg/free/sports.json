It’s the personal basketball trainer that’s always with you, capturing your performance, your stats, and your progress—guiding you to the next level. With HomeCourt, every rep counts. \n\nTRAIN SMARTER\nHomeCourt captures your moves and your stats as you train—so you can see your true skill level. HomeCourt uses the camera on your device to track your performance in real-time, everything from your jump shot to your crossover. In-depth data and analytics help you break down every session.

You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad. No special basketballs, uncomfortable sensors, or expensive equipment is required. Just set up your phone with a clear view of the court and starting training and competing through HomeCourt.\n\nPRICING\n• Free: Access the full library of 100+ drills and activities. Get unlimited shot tracking.\n• HomeCourt Plus: Access your full workout history, get complete skill ratings, join the members-only training club, request feedback from HomeCourt pro trainers, participate in HomeCourt Global Camp, and create up to 4 user profiles.\n\nHomeCourt Plus is available for subscription as either monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions. Payment will be charged to your App Store account upon the expiration of the free trial period. Subscription automatically renews unless the subscription is canceled or auto-renew turned off at least 24 hours before the expiration of the free trial period or the current subscription period. Subscription may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to App Store account settings after purchase.

      "label": "MTBs and E-MTBs are equipped with parts, some of which have quite complex settings.\nMost riders have not adjusted their forks, shocks, or tires optimally, but these settings can be crucial for a safe and pleasurable ride.\nTune, document, and compare your mountain bike settings with SAGLY.\n\nA better suspension setup on your mountain bike means not only more comfort and more safety but also more fun and also faster riding.\n\nMTB Suspension App to manage all your setups.\n\nMountain bike setups can be managed, edited, copied and much more. Your MTB setups are shown in a nice and clear way. A notes field helps you to keep track of additional info, like what in what weather conditions you created the setup, and so on. Adjustments for wet conditions are calculated automatically.\n\nAnother feature the MTB Suspension App supports the rider with suggested solutions for problems with the suspension settings. This helps the rider to continuously improve the setup, while riding.\n\n\nBALANCE FEATURE\n\nThe balance feature checks if your MTB setup is balanced between the rear and the front part of your mountain bike and also gives hints how to improve and balance your suspension setup.\n\n\nKNOW-HOW\n\nIn addition, the you receive general tips & tricks as well as an explanation of terms for optimizing and maintaining the your bike settings.\n\nAnother function supports you with suggested solutions for problems with the mountain bike settings. In this way you can tune your mtb setup.\n\nThe EASY SETUP GUIDE is part of the MTB suspension app SAGLY and guides you through a base setup by using the SAG. The user inputs the suspension part’s travel and the used travel when standing on the bike. This SAG calculator calculates the SAG based on your inputs and gives hints based on the result.\n\nThe EASY SETUP GUIDE of SAGLY helps you to find an appropriate base setup by giving you recommendations for your tire pressure based on your weight and the riding terrain.\n\n\nEXPLORE SETUPS\n\nExplore setups from other riders in the MTB suspension app SAGLY. Filter and Search by frame, fork, shock or tire-models. Sort by number of high-fives (likes), number of comments, and recently created. The setups of other riders are displayed with all information about the rider and the bikes the setup is created for.\n\nYou can high-five (like) those setups, create comments or even try those setups out and copy them to your setups.\n\n\nOFFLINE SUPPORT\n\nIt does not really matter where you are or how remote the trail is, you can make changes anytime on your setup and SAGLY synchronizes the changes as soon as you have internet again.\n\n\nFEEDBACK LOOP\n\nMoreover SAGLY will keep in dialogue with you and ask you for feedback on how you feel on your latest changes, so that new recommendations can be given. A cycle of continuous improvement for your setups.\n\n\nHISTORY FEATURE\n\nHave a history of changes to track your progress on your setup. This feature is based on the “Bracketing” method. This method helps you find the perfect chassis settings and is used also in Downhill World Cup Racing.\n\nWhy SAGLY?\n\nMountain biking is not only a sport, hobby or lifestyle in our opinion. We associate mountain biking with much more. \n\nWhen you ride your mountain bike, you experience the nature, improve your physical and mental health, you get to meet other people, you encounter pleasure and enjoyment, you strengthen your will and sometimes you learn how to get up again. \n\nThose are just a view reasons, why we think it is worth working on an innovative mobile app like SAGLY. SAGLY’S technology helps you not only to document, tune and compare your mountain bike settings, but also to enjoy a really great activity, mountain biking.\n\n\nOTHER REASON WHY A GOOD MTB SETUP MATTERS\n\nImproved handling and control. Proper bike settings allows you to adjust the amount of support and damping that your bike provide. This can help you to maintain better control when riding over rough terrain."

(Currently only available in Malaysia)\n\nEarn Deemples credits for your next game:\n- Get instant cashback when you book and pay for your game.\n- Refer a friend and you'll get RM20 when they book and pay for their first game. More referrals, more credits!\n\nHandicap index:\n- Deemples currently uses the USGA handicap formula and is not recognised or an official handicap of any golf club.\n- Golfers use the Deemples handicap because the scores used to calculate the handicap cannot be submitted by them.\n- This requires 2 other golfers in the Deemples game to submit the same adjusted gross score, course rating, and slope rating for the golfer in order for it to count for handicapping purposes.\n- This submission method makes it the most trusted and non-manipulable golf handicap.\n- The Deemples handicap will be moving to the World Handicap System in due time.\n\nWhat if I'm new to golf：\n- Join any 1-1 or group beginner lessons on the app.\n- There are lots of beginner-friendly golf games for you to join if you want to get on the golf course.\n\nMarkets supported:\nDeemples is currently available in Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Australia and Malaysia.

      "label": "Measure and train your golf tempo with Apple Watch by TrackMyGolf!\n\nBack in June 2015 at Apple's developer conference, Apple announced the Ping tempo app which uses the watch's accelerometer to measure tempo. Like many golfers, we have been waiting for this app for a long time. We are finally fed up with waiting and decide to develop it ourselves. \n\nThis app uses your Apple Watch's accelerometer/gyroscope to measure your tempo. You can compete with others on the longest streak of golf swings with a perfect tempo. The app also offer statistics on percentage of slow, fast, or perfect tempo swings, so you know what to work on. An ideal tempo has 3:1 ratio, meaning your back swing should be 3 times as long as your down swing. \n\nIf you want to measure your swing tempos (and more) in real games, you can also use our golf GPS + Scorecard app which tracks your swing on the golf course, in addition to telling you GPS distances to 35,000+ golf courses and track your shots automatically.\n\nThis is designed for Watch OS3, with a much more robust swing detection algorithm. No more limitations on swing detection like in version 1.x. \n\nNote: If no swing is detected for any reason, right after the swing, you may be prompted to log the trace. Click log, then email us support@vimo.co with the time of logging, and we will take a look.\n\n** Watch OS3 is required for this app. If it is not showing on your watch, go to Apple Watch app on Phone, choose \"General->Software Update\" and follow instructions. **\n\nThis app integrates with Apple HealthKit. It records your golf practice session as a golf workout."

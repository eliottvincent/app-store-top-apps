It’s the personal basketball trainer that’s always with you, capturing your performance, your stats, and your progress—guiding you to the next level. With HomeCourt, every rep counts. \n\nTRAIN SMARTER\nHomeCourt captures your moves and your stats as you train—so you can see your true skill level. HomeCourt uses the camera on your device to track your performance in real-time, everything from your jump shot to your crossover. In-depth data and analytics help you break down every session.

You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad.

Get unlimited shot tracking.\n• HomeCourt Plus: Access your full workout history, get complete skill ratings, join the members-only training club, request feedback from HomeCourt pro trainers, participate in HomeCourt Global Camp, and create up to 4 user profiles.\n\nHomeCourt Plus is available for subscription as either monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions.

The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

This helps you:\n\n - to check your stringer’s performance\n - to monitor the loss of tension over the course of time\n - to identify the appropriate point of time for new strings\n\nWhy is this so important? When the strings wear out, the precision and the touch of the racket get lost – just as a racing car’s wheels start spinning when its tires are worn out.\n\nPlaying your badminton racket with fresh strings has many advantages:\n\n - higher repulsion power for longer clears and faster smashes\n - better feel for the ball and more controled hits\n - better shock-damping performance for joint-protection at arm and shoulder"

During every sailing race you’ll get to see the action up close, as each of the F50 catamarans have multiple cameras on board for real time video streaming. \n\nAs well as getting a virtual on board experience, you’ll also enjoy birds-eye views of the whole race, augmented with key information such as where the finish line is, how fast each boat is travelling and how far they have left to go. The SailGP app is your ultimate race companion, here to make sure you never miss a second of the action!\n\nPACKED WITH REAL TIME DATA\nSailGP is a world-first sailing competition based around innovation and technology. Each boat is fitted with 1,200 data points, tracking every second of the race and syncing with your SailGP app in real time. As the teams battle it out to reach the finish line first, you’ll be able to customise the app, to view the data and stats that interest you the most. From Wind Speed and Velocity Made Good, to Time To Mark and Leg Number, just tap any stat in the app to learn more.\n\nSWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT TEAMS   \nSailGP includes teams from Australia, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the United States and you can support your nation by following them through the race. Should you wish, you can switch teams mid-race, to compare how the other boats are getting on.\n\nCHANGE VIEWS AND CAMERA ANGLES   \nChoose how you view the race by tailoring the stats that you see on your screen. Depending on what interests you the most, you can select one of two views. Default mode includes a larger video with less stats or you can opt for Advanced mode which makes the video smaller and shows you lots more data.\n\nCOMPARE BOATS RACING HEAD TO HEAD  \nWant to see how your team is doing against another? No problem! With the SailGP app you can compare two teams together at the same time.

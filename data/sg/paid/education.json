If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!! \n\nBut first let me tell you a story…. \n****************************************** \nOnce upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. \n\nThe legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. \n\nAll that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure! \n****************************************** \n\nBut, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! \n\nAnd now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me? \n\nThank you for your purchase!"

The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

      "label": "\"Kids learn about Animals\" is an educational game for children aged 1 - 4 years from the series “Little One Learns Words”!\n\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of different animals, all while learning their names and listen to the animals’ unique sounds!\n\nThese carefully selected photographs allow your child to not only learn the names of the various animals, but also glimpse into the animal’s beautiful world and everything it offers! \n\nAfter your child looks over and experiences the flashcards, there is a fun game waiting for them, which tests how much they’ve understood. Regardless of the number of correct answers, the player earns stars and young talent is rewarded with thunderous applause and balloons!\n\nA significant feature of this app is that there are no unrealistic drawings. Instead, full-length beautiful pictures are used that resemble actual animals (as they look in real life), which helps the child easily remember their names and features. \n\nDo you have older children in primary school? If so, this educational game will also come in handy for them because in addition to Spanish, the app supports English, German, French and other languages. Playing these types of games with flashcards has been proven to aid students in quickly learning a foreign language.  They can discover new words and are able to easily impress their teachers and classmates!\n\nYour child doesn’t even need to know how to read with this app! Its simple interface and voice prompts allow even the youngest kid to play and learn by themselves! After playing the game, be sure to visit the zoo or pet store with your child – you’ll be happy and impressed as they present their newly acquired knowledge of all the animals they see!\n\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Click the upper right icon to get your brain training history records.\n2. A 2008 study published in the PNAS scientific journal shows that a memory task called dual n-back may improve working memory (short term memory) and fluid intelligence.\n3. The dual n-back task involves remembering a sequence of spoken letters and a sequence of positions of a square at the same time, and identifying when a letter or position matches the one that appeared earlier.\n4. The App implements this dual n-back task, and allows you to attempt to improve your own working memory and fluid intelligence.\n5. Not only dual n-back, but triple n-back and quad n-back are also implemented in the App.  By selecting \"Position\" and \"Sound\", you can work on dual n-back. By adding \"Color\", you can work on triple n-back. Moreover, adding \"Shape\", you can work on quad n-back.\n6. N-back can be selected from 1 to 16. The default is 2, that is dual 2-back. N controls the one that appeared earlier.\n7. All modes are 20 trials per session and 2.5 seconds per trial. 2.5 seconds per trial is the default, the option is from 0.5 seconds to 2.5 seconds.\n8. The symbol display time is 0.5 seconds as the default. However, it can be selected from 0.5 seconds to 2.5 seconds depends on your situation.\n9. Repetition ratio can be selected from 20% to 50%.  The default is 25%.  It controls the frequency of your available identifyings.\n10. When a trial is over, the score will be shown and recorded to the history data by date and time."

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

      "label": "* Finalist for the BestAppEver Award: Toddler Apps *\n \nThe best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.\n\nNow with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.\n\nFirst Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:\n\n** Animals **\n** Vehicles **\n** Colors **\n** Shapes **\n** Words from around the house **\n\n(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs.

Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen.

Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training.

Thank\nyou” - Chattity\n\nSound Touch is the #1 app for entertaining and engaging young children -- complete with\nanimal sounds and music.\n\nStimulate children's brains and teach them all at the same time.\n\nListen to the sounds that farm animals, pets and other wildlife make in nature by touching\nwhimsical cartoons. Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound.

Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

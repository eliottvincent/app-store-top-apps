This application simplifies the process of plotting out the four pillar chart using the birth date of any person. \n\nThe professional version also calculates advance information like the 12 stages of life, hidden stem information and symbolic stars etc. This information is useful to allow advance analysis on the chart and thus develop a more comprehensive strategy."

Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time.

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

Put the Bible into your daily life. Every time you look at your device! \n\nFEATURES: \n\n- Over 1,100 custom Bible-based iPhone & iPod Touch Lock Screens \n- iOS 9 Support & Design\n- Thumbnail view!\n- Categories (New, Popular, Love, Relationships, Encouragement, Prayer, etc.)\n- 15-second Video Devotionals (from our Instagram page)\n- Universal App optimized for iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch! \n- iPad-specific images, perfect for Landscape & Portrait modes\n- Tap and hold to save to your Camera Roll on your device \n- Many more Bible Lock Screens™ (not available online) \n- Suggest a Verse (suggest verses for new Bible Lock Screens™) \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\niPhone users look at their lock screen many times a day, to use their phone, to check the time, or to use one of the millions of apps available on the iOS platform. \n\nThe lock screen appears for about eight seconds and is the first thing you see when you use your iPhone. Eight seconds is a lot of time to be looking at something random. Why not use a background with Scripture on it! \n\nMy heart is that these Bible Lock Screen backgrounds would help remind you of what the Word of God says and help you walk it out. \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\nAPP STORE REVIEWS: \n\n\"This app is a GREAT buy! By far the best Christian wallpaper app in the AppStore. Such a great way to be encouraged daily by God's word in beautiful art form for your iPhone!\" - Kim S. (iTunes User) \n\n\"This has been so awesome! The variety of lock/home screens available is practically endless. I also love the new update. Flows great! What a great way to profess your faith in the 21st century. Get it!!\" - Lando25 (iTunes User) \n\n\"What a blessing it is to have this app! I'm able to encourage other people by sending them a pic. And when I look at my phone I get to be reminded of my sweet Savior the Lord Jesus Christ! Thanks a million times over! - Torch A. (iTunes User) \n\n\"This app is the best for getting to know Bible verses and if you are having a bad day then you will always have something to look at when you turn on your social networking device.\" - R110545 (iTunes User) \n\n\"I love this app! It has definitely replaced regular lock screen pictures I usually use and is also a great conversation starter when others use my phone!

      "label": "NEWS:\nFamily Tracker was used to locate a missing child - see news report on: http://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-app-missing-idUSBRE8460GZ20120507\n\n***SUPPORT NOTICE**** \nWe do help everyone who contacts us via our iphone@logsat.com email address, but unfortunately most users give bad ratings without ever contacting us for support. Please do contact us if you have any issues, we're always there to help! \n*************** \n\nFamily Tracker allows you to track your wife, husband, children and fiancée. You can now find out where they are, at anytime, as long as they have their phones with them. Family Tracker is available for other platforms as well, so you can track (and be tracked by) other devices as well - check our website for more details. \n\nPlease note that starting with the new iOS4 and supported hardware, Family Tracker runs in the background at all times, and, unlike previous versions of Family Tracker, user intervention is **NOT** needed for you to track them. Family Tracker runs at all times, continuously updating the GPS location of the device. Even if the iPhone is rebooted, Family Tracker will automatically resume tracking and updating its position! \n\nSo how does this work? \n\nSimple. Install Family Tracker on the iPhone/iPad you want to track. From then on, you can use either a web browser or via the Family Tracker app itself installed on your own iPhone/iPad to locate your family member. \n\nIf the device you wish to track does not support multitasking (for example, older iPhones 3G, iPads), you can still use Family Tracker to locate the family member. Using the web or your own iPhone, you will be able to \"ping\" the other iPhone. This is done by sending the other iPhone a (free) “Apple Push Notification” which will cause an alert to sound on your family member’s iPhone, even if the phone in is stand-by, just as would happen if the iPhone receives an SMS. As soon as this alert is acknowledged, their GPS position will be recorded, and their location will be updated on a map. If you are using an iPhone yourself to track them, you will be sent a Push Notification to inform you that the family member has accepted your \"ping\". These notifications will be automatically re-sent every 60 seconds until they are acknowledged. If the recipient is trying to ignore them or does not hear them, this repetition will help acknowledging them. \n\nFamily Tracker does not need to know your iPhone cell number to function, as it does not send SMS messages for notifications. Your email address is instead used to send free Apple Push Notifications to the iPhones being tracked. These notifications are free, specific to our Family Tracker application, and work anywhere in the world as long as the iPhone and/or iTouch being tracked has internet access via the cellular network or WiFi. \n\nNotice: ***Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.*** For this reason, we strongly recommend users to configure Family Tracker to use the \"Driving Only\" accuracy in the GPS setting. This special mode updates the GPS location only when a significant location change occurs, which results in a tremendous gain in battery life.\n\nAdditional pro features, such as the ability to see the past locations for the previous 2 weeks, and the ability to set geofences so you are alerted when users that you track enter or leave certain areas are available via an optional iTunes subscription.\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions are available for either $1.99/month, or $5.99/3 months, or $9.99/6 months or $19.99/year. Privacy policy & terms of use: http://logsat.com/family-tracker-privacy.asp"

Five Element analysis is then used to help you optimize the energy of your home or office.\n\nFeatures\n\nCreate Profiles for you and your family, friends or clients. The Profile calculates which compass sectors influence your success, health, romance and personal growth.  There are also compass sectors which bring bad luck, obstacles, illness and total loss.\n\nYour Profile is also associated with one of the Five  Elements - Earth, Fire, Metal, Water and Wood. Learn which other Elements are compatible with your Element, and which are incompatible.  Learn how to use the colors, patterns and shapes associated with these Elements to decorate your home in a way to enhance the compatible Element energies or calm the incompatible Element energies.\n\nCreate Locations for your home or office.  Double-tap in the chart area of the Location Detail screen to bring up your Photo Album and select a floor-plan for each of your floors.  To get a floor-plan into your Photo Album, you may either take a photo of the floor-plan using the iPhone's camera, or by downloading it from a website if it is available online.\n\nOnce you have selected a floor-plan image, rotate it by swiping your finger up or down, so that the north side of the floor-plan is pointing towards the bottom of the screen.  In Chinese Feng Shui, north is always positioned at the bottom of the compass rose. Swipe Left or Right to scroll between the various floors belonging to the Location.\n\nNow, you may select various Profiles to see how the chart of their beneficial and problematic compass sectors line up with the floor-plan.\n\nYou may also select the Flying Star Chart to create a  Nine Star Ki 'Natal' chart for your home or office.  Or, select a different year to see the 'Annual Stars' along with the natal stars.\n\nThe analysis and charts found on each screen may be e-mailed to your friends, family or clients so that they may share in the knowledge too!\n\nNote: One crash has been reported under OS 3.1, Will be testing to remedy this shortly.  OS 2.2 or OS 3.0 have reported no issues."

      "label": "What’s your personality? How do you and your loved ones, friends, and co-workers compare? Imagine having quick access to the right keywords to get your point across!\n\nWhether you’re in a boring meeting, on the phone with a challenging client, or dealing with a flustered family member — this application is for you. The essential themes of each personality Type are just a tap away. You can also explore each personality in depth: learn a person’s core needs and values, cognitive processes, interaction style, team behavior, pitfalls, growth points, and much more.\n\nYou will quickly learn about Type Theory and how to positively influence others using the “Compare” feature. This feature relies on sophisticated algorithms to show you the likely commonalities, differences, and synergies between two people. The algorithms compare communication, problem solving, learning and adaptation, love relationships, growth and change, and more.\n\nIN DEPTH:\nPersonality is far more than just superficial traits. Personality reveals motivation and cognition — why (and how) people act. In short, this application helps you discover what makes people “tick”. When you know why someone needs something, or how they prefer to go about doing a task or interaction, then you have leverage to improve the situation. \n\nFor almost six decades, thousands of successful professionals — counselors, teachers, managers, coaches, salespeople, and others — have used the insights of Type Theory. Type Theory is supported by decades of published statistical analysis of over six million people.\n\nThe famous and highly respected Dr. Carl Jung first described eight cognitive processes people use. The eight processes combine to match the sixteen personality Types. Thus, when you learn about Type Theory, you learn what occurs on the inside; in a person’s head and heart — and how they relate back-and-forth with others. No other personality theory can give you this picture.\n\nThis application is ideal for serious students of psychology. Learning about ourselves and others is not done by simply “taking a test” that “tells” us who we are. Although we include multiple personality assessments, genuine learning for adults involves continual exploration and reflection. This application gives you tools; you the one who brings the curiosity and patience for discovery.\n\nEXPERTISE:\nThis application is the work of renowned Type Theorist and UCLA lecturer Dario Nardi, PhD, author of numerous books on personality psychology, cognition, neuroscience, and self-leadership. Dr. Nardi has worked with many other experts, including practicing organizational development consultants and psychologists. What you get is the product of many minds and personalities, not just one.\n\nFEATURES:\n•   Save Multiple Personality Assessments and Profiles For Reference\n•   Includes Three Personality Assessments: “Short Form”, “Long Form”, and “Standard-Form”\n•   Essential Details of the Well-Known 16 Personality Types (“ESTJ”, “INFP”, etc) by Isabel Briggs-Myers\n•   Keywords to Apply Subtle Influence on Others\n•   A Super “Compare” Feature to Pinpoint and Manage Commonalities and Differences Between Any Two Personality Types\n•   An Explanation of Type Theory with Links to Handy Online Resources"

An alarm that irritates me enough to wake up\n √ Exceptional App!! This app is super super annoying... It really gets me out of bed\n √ Love it. It's the best alarm ever\n √ Great Alarm! Been having trouble getting up. No more!\n √ This app is so easy to use, and has all the perfect functions! I'll never be late again!\n\nFEATURED IN THE MEDIA\n √ Definitely one of the more “annoying” alarms to help you get up and out of bed in the morning. – AppAdvice.com\n √ If you are the kind of person who has a difficult time waking up after you’ve turned off your alarm, this app may help keep you from being late for work. - iDownloadBlog\n\nAlso in MacWorld NL, AppsRumors, AppChronicles, etc.\n\nHOW IT WORKS \n\nAs the name \"Step Out!\" implied, the only way you can turn off this alarm clock is STEPPING out of your bed (you still can snooze - in a limited duration). It uses advanced image recognition and step tracking technologies to check whether you’re far away from your bed. \n\nAfter ringing, the app asks you to capture another photo of a specified place, it should be where you usually be every time you wake up, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, ... So you just take a photo and do your routine work like washing your face or preparing breakfast. \n\nAnother alternative is using the step counter, which simplifies this process into just nothing. You wake up and go to wherever you want with the device. After reaching enough number of steps, the alarm will automatically turn off. It’s simply a smarter alarm with no additional action., You’ll love using it from the very first time. \n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n\n- MUSIC ALARM \no Wake up with your favorite songs\no Listen to them when moving\n\n- FULLY FUNCTIONAL ALARM \no Easy setup with hand-drawn mini-game\no Repeating rule for daily, weekly alarms \no Built-in alarm sounds \no Snooze, Vibrate, Fade-in & Volume for the perfect experience \n\n- MOTION TRACKING \no Innovative motion tracking system to sense your steps\no Smart anti-cheat system to make sure that you are stepping\n\n**IMPORTANT: We do not encourage our users to step so fast when you are not totally awake, this app will just recognize the steps when you aren’t walking too fast.\n\n- IMAGE RECOGNITION\no State-of-the-art image recognizing engine\no Can match both horizontal and vertical pictures\no Strict image comparison to assure you’re leaving your bed and your eyes opened wide enough to take the right picture.\n\n**HINT: Choose a scene that has a stable light condition for better matching results.\n\n- SLEEP TIMER \no Fall asleep with music \no Auto-lock and ready for next alarm \n\n- FLASHLIGHT \no Easy to find way through the dark when you are stepping\n\n- CLOCK \no Full feature clock \no Show/hide seconds, 24 hour format, …"

All you need to know is one of the sizes — the application will tell the rest. Making a shopping trip to another country, online purchasing and an unexpected gift to your beloved will be easier when you can convert sizes on the go.\n\nWhy do we make Sizer?\n\nToday there is no easy way to order clothes online and be sure that it will fit on you well. Size charts do not help, because the size varies and depends on the brand, season, style and region. Size is the reason for the return of 30% of purchased goods online.\n\nSizer is designed to solve this problem - a smart algorithm that learns based on user data:\n1) be brave in online shopping;\n2) forget about returns;\n3) save shopping from stress.\n\n\nHow does Sizer work?\n\n1. You select sizes with the help of our algorithm.\n2. With the help of a button you give feedback - fit or didn’t fit.\n3. Sizer teaches the sizing algorithm.\n\nShopping is no longer a lottery with Sizer.\n\n\n\"An application that remembers that last year your jeans were two sizes smaller.\"\nGQ Russia\n\n\"You could've just said \"We have Beautiful Pixels!\".

Our algorithm analyses your voice and compares it with data from over 150 celebrities to let you understand your voice and learn how to improve it.\n\nThe Standard version of the app gives you a full analysis of your voice in terms of depth and variety and calculates a set of celebrity matches to give you a grounding of what your results mean.\n\nThe Pro version helps you improve your voice. Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too. We want to cover things like smoothness, nasality, vocal fry, even creating a rating of how attractive your voice currently is, based on the latest research. If you want to get the most out of your vocal chords, this is the app for you."

The writing is clean and witty. The drinks? Delicious. \n\n5 Star - Fantastic!! \n(UK iTunes review)\nI didn't think that this application would be up to the same standard set by the book (which is THE definitive cocktail bible), but I couldn't have been more wrong! It's every bit as informative as the book, and the fact that it's interactive - it lists the cocktails that you can make from the drinks in your cabinet - makes it even easier to use. And at the price of half a pint of beer, it's astonishingly under-priced for such a brilliant application.\n\n5 Star - Marvelous \n(UK iTunes review)\nLooks as good as the books, fits in the pocket......."

      "label": "7 Advanced Binaural Dream Induction Programs in One App!  Dream Inducer combines soothing ambient sounds with powerful binaural sequences to synchronize your brainwaves with frequencies associated with 7 different levels of dreaming. * Universal iOS App for iPhone/Pad * Headphones or Earbuds must be worn for binaural tones to be effective.\n\n* Each program includes a sleep induction phase and then introduces progressively higher frequency Alpha, Beta, and Theta dream sequences to stimulate increasingly vivid dreams.\n\n* To combine Brainwaves and Ambience with Audio from Another App use the 'Ambience + Other App' background mode.\n\n* To use just Brainwaves and Audio from Another App use the \"Other App\" option for the Background Mode.\n\n** How Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Works **\nThrough the process of brainwave entrainment human brainwave frequencies can be synchronized with a  frequency associated with a target mental state.  These Brainwave frequencies are too low for the human ear to hear, however, these low-frequencies can be perceived by the human brain if two different audible frequencies are played separately into each ear with headphones or earbuds.  For example, the human ear can't directly perceive the 2 Hz Delta-wave frequency associated with deep sleep, but if you wear headphones with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 137 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 2 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat.  As you listen, your brainwaves will begin to match that frequency, inducing the associated mental state.\n\nDream Inducer improves upon basic binaural techniques by layering multiple signals and then assembling these into sequences of programs that combine to create extremely unique experiences."

The cry is not the problem but it signals a problem that must be discovered.  The Babywise Nap App is an analysis tool that can help any parent isolate the underlying cause of nap disruptions and sleep disturbances for infants between 2 to 12 months of age. By working through a few basic questions, the App reduces the hundreds of nap disturbance variables down to the most likely causes for a baby's sleep disturbance. Once the list is generated, the app offers the most appropriate solution based on the analysis from the data provided. \r\n\r\nAdapted from the best-selling On Becoming Babywise book, the Babywise Nap App comes with solutions proven successful for millions of children around the world.\r\n\r\nAlong with the analysis feature, parents will find:\r\n\r\n - Basic nap and sleep facts\r\n - How healthy nap habits are developed\r\n - How many naps a day based on baby's age\r\n - How long each nap will be based on baby's age\r\n - Explanations of the most common sleep disturbances\r\n - How food and waketime activities influence nap behavior\r\n - How and when to drop a nap based on baby’s need and age\r\n - How to train a baby to sleep through the night\r\n\r\nThe Babywise Nap App assumes a baby is on a well-established feed-wake-sleep routine, already sleeping through the night a minimum of eight hours, and has already established healthy nap patterns."

      "label": "Have you ever wondered if there was a certain way you could act to attract the women around you? \n\nWell, it has actually become apparent that there is a very particular way of behaving which is considered \"attractive\" by women. No matter how much \"free-will\" we think we have, when it comes to mating, we are mostly motivated by instinct-controlled bodies. In fact, our bodies are constantly listening for \"cues of attraction\". And every time you come in contact with something which your instincts deem \"attractive\", you are given a neuro-chemical treat in your brain which produces a feeling of pleasure. Fundamentally, it is the chase for this feeling which controls the actions of both men and women in their search for a mate. \n\nFor a man, the strongest feelings of attraction come from the form of the female body, it's something seen. But for a woman, the strongest feelings come from a \"mental-model\" they construct in their minds, something imagined. And this is the key to understanding how to attract women, because knowing how to complete a woman's mental-model is ultimately the secret to triggering a strong feeling of attraction in her. This concept is the basis for this course and the key to getting any girl you will ever meet. \n\nGet Any Girl is first and foremost based on you and your ability to use this concept to attract women... \n\n- In “Game Theory”, we will utilize the techniques of Neuro-Linguistic Programming to lay a foundation for new behavioral-patterns based on \"The Pillars of Attraction\".  These are the characteristics used to complete a woman's \"mental-model\" and trigger attraction.\n\n- In “Self-Empower”, we will utilize several techniques to clear you of any limiting-beliefs which could be hindering your self-confidence and your ability to approach new women. \n\n- In “The Pickup”, we will walk through a pickup from start to finish. This includes everything you will need to do in order to successfully approach a woman, get her number, and even take her home with you from a bar. \n\n- In “The Relationship” we will, analyze the best first-date ideas, take a look at the \"early relationship dynamic\", learn how to supply romance and drama to keep her interested, and even touch on the idea of love and what it means to women.\n\nAfter all that, you should be ready for anything the Dating World has to throw at you... \n—————————————————\nApp Specs:\n\n-  82 pages (20,492 words)\n-  49 dating lessons\n-  Includes a 20-minute hypnosis session \n\nDownload now to begin."

It also provides a description for each phase, sign and mansion. You can navigate through the information in various ways — say, phase-by-phase, day-by-day or month-by-month - whatever is more convenient for you. \n\nPhases show you the energy of the day, signs — the mood of the day, while the void-of-course periods might tell you when it is better not to do certain things. Mansions were used by different cultures from the time immemorial, they tell for what a particular day is good or not so good.\n\nTo calculate the times, iLuna uses the time zone of the device on which it runs, so if your iPhone or iPod touch shows your current time correctly, iLuna's information is precise too.\n\nOnce any of the events reported by iLuna happens, you will get a notification, provided you allowed the app to send you notifications."

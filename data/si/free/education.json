The app provides online access to a choice of code editors for programming your micro:bit and, when your program is ready, the app beams it to the micro:bit via Bluetooth wireless.  Easy-to-follow screens lead you through the process of pairing your iPad (or iPhone) to the micro:bit and then transferring your program code.  \nCompared with previous versions,  the micro:bit app Version 3 contains these additional features:\n•\tPair with any number of micro:bits\n•\tChoose which micro:bit is currently connected\n•\tStore HEX files in the app\n•\tChoose a HEX file for flashing\n•\tExport and delete HEX files\n•\tImport stored HEX files directly into JavaScript Blocks editor\n•\tRapid download from JavaScript Blocks editor\n•\tMonitor data detected by micro:bit sensors\n•\tUse the range of micro:bit Bluetooth services in real time\n•\tDisplay messages on the micro:bit LEDs\n•\tSend control commands to the micro:bit buttons and pins\n•\tDe-bug your program code while it is running in the micro:bit\n•\tUse a simulated gamepad to send commands to the micro:bit\n•\tView camera images ready for taking photos or video\n\nAs well as providing more flexible handling of your program scripts and HEX files, a major addition in Version 3 is the Monitor and Control page.  This lets you observe real-time data from the micro:bit sensors, send messages directly to the LEDs and control the micro:bit buttons and pins from your iPad or iPhone.  Monitor is ideal for exploiting Bluetooth services in real time, and for de-bugging your program code while it is running in the micro:bit.\n\nThe MakeCode code editor now requires iOS 13 or later."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

It has been amazing to track my progress and realize I understand more and can even communicate a bit after just a few months of 15 minutes a day.”\n– Sophia Bogle\n\n“If you want to learn European Portuguese, this is the site to use. I have been an educator for 27 years, and am not easily impressed by educational software. Yet I am so impressed by the care, thought, and planning behind this site.

Sodelavci SEIC Ptuj prav tako uporabljajo aplikacijo za svoja interna usposabljanja.\n\n3X zakaj mobilna aplikacija SEIC MICRO:\n\n1.UČENJE KJERKOLI IN KADARKOLI, ZA VSE UČNE TIPE\nUčenje ni bilo nikoli tako enostavno in učinkovito. Treninge, ki jih potrebujete za delo v vašem podjetju, opravite enostavno s pametno napravo iz Vaše dnevne sobe.\n\n2. V ZNANJU JE MOČ. VEČ ZNANJA= VEČJA KAKOVOST \nŽivimo v času hitrih sprememb in nenehnih novosti. Zato je danes vedeti več še toliko bolj pomembno. V znanju je moč, ki vam je nihče ne more vzeti in mi vas bogatimo skozi strokovne in aktualne vsebine.\n\n3. INOVATIVNO UČNO OKOLJE\nAplikacija vam omogoča, da imate zbrane posamezne online treninge in gradiva na enem mestu. Z inovativnim pristopom k učenju - skozi online igranje kviza  - s prikazom učnih kartic, kjer uporabnik neobremenjeno in v udobju okolja, ki ga izbere, pridobiva kompetence.\n\nSEIC MICRO strategija učenja s pomočjo mikro treningov\nS pomočjo aplikacije SEIC MICRO in metode mikro treninga se različne vsebine znanj pripravlja celovito in poglablja s kratkimi in aktivnimi trening koraki.\nKlasična oblika mikro treninga za učenje uporablja algoritem. Vprašanja se obdelujejo v naključnem vrstnem redu. Če je vprašanje odgovorjeno napačno, se bo ponavljalo, vse dokler ni pravilno odgovorjeno trikrat zapored v lekciji. To ustvarja trajnostni učinek učenja.\n\nPoleg osnovnega učenja je ponujeno tudi stopenjsko učenje. V ta namen sistem samodejno razdeli učne kartice na tri ravni in jih naključno dodeli udeležencu treninga. Med posameznimi stopnjami je zagotovljena tako imenovana \"faza počitka\" v časovni obliki. To je potrebno, da bi dosegli združljivost med stopnjami in trajnostni efekt učenja. Končni test prikaže, kje je prišlo do napredka pri učenju in kje so možne vrzeli znanja. Test se lahko prilagodi, če je potrebno.\n\nKot tretja možnost pa se lahko uči tudi direktno z opravljanjem testa, brez izrecnega predhodnega učenja z aplikacijo SEIC MICRO.\n\nMotivator za učenje - kviz in / ali učenje skozi tekmovanje\nUsposabljanje na SEIC MICRO je sproščeno in navdihuje. Z možnostjo kvizov se izvaja igriv pristop k učenju. Druge uporabnike lahko na primer povabimo na tekmovanje ali dvoboj. Učenje je tako lahko še bolj zabavno. Primer  take igre je: V treh sklopih vprašanj, vsak s sklop s tremi vprašanji, določimo kdo je kralj znanja.\n\nPogovor skozi  funkcijo klepeta\nFunkcija klepeta v aplikaciji uporabnikom omogoča izmenjavo mnenj pri sejah posameznega treninga."

That you can turn your phone into a sonar?\n\nphyphox gives you access to the sensors of your phone either directly or through ready-to-play experiments which analyze your data and let you export raw data along with the results for further analysis. You can even define your own experiments on phyphox.org and share them with colleagues, students and friends.\n\nSelected Features:\n- A selection of pre-defined experiments. Just press play to start.\n- Export your data to a range of widely used formats\n- Remote-control your experiment through a web interface from any PC on the same network as your phone. No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

Portal smo nadgradili, tako da lahko na enem mestu prejemate obvestila, gradiva in različne dokumente s strani šole, si izmenjujete sporočila z učitelji, urejate prehrano, imate vpogled v ocene, domače naloge, urnike ipd.\n\nS portalom želimo izboljšati komunikacijo med učitelji in starši oz. učenci/dijaki. Na ta način boste vedno na tekočem z dogajanjem v šoli, z ocenami in aktivnostmi, bolje boste lahko povezani s procesom izobraževanja svojega otroka in pridobivanjem kompetenc.\n\nZa prijavo potrebujete geslo. Za geslo za osnovni vpogled se obrnite na šolo. Če geslo za Lo.Polis že imate (za odjavo malice, izbor izbirnih predmetov, naročilo dijaške izkaznice ter prijavo v e-redovalnico) bo vaše geslo delovalo na spletnem portalu in aplikaciji."

Over 1 million bright minds saved more than 14 million ideas in their personal library so far.\n\nIt's like your social media feed, if your social media feed had things that mattered :-)\n\nKnowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.\n\nIdeas are created by Deepstash members, called stashers. Whenever a stasher reads a book article or listens to a podcast and they find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, they will add an idea about it in Deepstash.\n\nA daily source of inspiring & life changing stories and ideas. Read articles, learn skills, get productivity tips and discover life hacks. The magic of Deepstash is that everything you do builds your knowledge library: be it contributing  your own ideas or collecting idea cards from other stashers. Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.\n\nPERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS\n\nChoose a few topics of interest (more than 4,000 topics to choose from) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.\n\nThe more you save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.\n\nBUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nYou can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.\n\nSearch and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes, which are basically collections of insights stocked up and ready to go for when you need them: a Powerpoint presentation, a new job interview, a date, a project at work, or negotiating your rent with the landlord.\n\nSHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nAdd your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.\n\nShare your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this. \n\nShare a link to ideas or just an image. We built special image formats for each social network (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and others) so your ideas will look their best.\n\nNO ADS. NO DISTRACTIONS\n\nThe Deepstash app is free and open to everyone. Get a clean reading experience and focus on the content instead of being distracted with annoying ads. Just get a quick free account (Facebook & Google login) and you’re good to go.\n\nGood for your career. \nGreat for your life. \nGive it a shot!\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://deepstash.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://deepstash.com/privacy-policy"

You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York. Lively, colorful, and sometimes surprising characters: an eccentric old lady will help you find a place to live, and a greedy hot-dog vendor who will try to short-change… They (and many more) speak different accents and will help you master street talk. There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go. Each conversation takes no more than 3 minutes and will fit into even the busiest of schedules.\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY\n\nYou’ll learn 6,000 of the most common words everyone needs to travel, work, and communicate in a foreign language. Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations. Built-in games will challenge your skill and speed – you can even compete with other users around the world in real-time!"

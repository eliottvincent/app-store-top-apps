Portal smo nadgradili, tako da lahko na enem mestu prejemate obvestila, gradiva in različne dokumente s strani šole, si izmenjujete sporočila z učitelji, urejate prehrano, imate vpogled v ocene, domače naloge, urnike ipd.\n\nS portalom želimo izboljšati komunikacijo med učitelji in starši oz. učenci/dijaki. Na ta način boste vedno na tekočem z dogajanjem v šoli, z ocenami in aktivnostmi, bolje boste lahko povezani s procesom izobraževanja svojega otroka in pridobivanjem kompetenc.\n\nZa prijavo potrebujete geslo. Za geslo za osnovni vpogled se obrnite na šolo. Če geslo za Lo.Polis že imate (za odjavo malice, izbor izbirnih predmetov, naročilo dijaške izkaznice ter prijavo v e-redovalnico) bo vaše geslo delovalo na spletnem portalu in aplikaciji."

We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Welcome to WikiArt.org, the online home for visual arts from all around the world.\n\nAim of the project\nOur primary goal is to make world’s art accessible to anyone and anywhere. WikiArt already features some 250.000 artworks by 3.000 artists, localized on 7 languages. These artworks are in museums, universities, town halls, and other civic buildings of more than 100 countries. Most of this art is not on public view. With your active involvement, we are planning to cover the entire art history of the Earth, from cave artworks to modern private collections. We also provide you with tools for translation on as many languages as needed.\n\nFinancial status\nThe project is non-profit. We use donation and advertising as financial sources to cover hosting and technical service expenses. The content of the site is launched for free by our Volunteer Team – and you are welcome to join it. Check out ‘Donate’ and ‘ how to contribute’ section to know more about it.\n\nCopyright policy\nWikiArt presents both public domain and copyright protected artworks. The latter are showcased in accordance with fair use principle:\n   as historically significant artworks\n   as used for informational and educational purposes\n   as readily available on the internet\n   as low resolution copies unsuitable for commercial use\n\nWe respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and remove copyright protected artworks, or block them for users from countries where infringement is alerted. But mostly we try to get artist’s permission to demonstrate his art, and confirm it with a credit line.\nWe provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, please submit the notice by wikipaintings@gmail.com"

      "label": "You are probably here because your child doesn’t enjoy reading that much. Reading makes them frustrated and tired. Reversing letters might be giving them a hard time, maybe they are affected by dyslexia? \n\nDaily reading practice is crucial for the development of reading skills. With KOBI, reading is enjoyable even for struggling readers.\n\n[ EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTION ] KOBI combines proven methods with innovative techniques that boost the effect of reading practice. It has been developed by a team of parents, design thinkers, and digital experts working with over 20 educational professionals. Based on scientific research and personal experience we have built a solution that helped our dyslexic kids fall in love with reading. \n\nKobi was given the coveted “Assured” badge by British Dyslexia Association, proving it provides quality support to a struggling reader. \n\nNow KOBI is here to help your child too.\n\nWith color-coded letters and other child-friendly tools, there will be:\n- no more reversing letters\n- easier blending and decoding\n- improved reading accuracy & rate - resulting in\n- better fluency & comprehension\n\nAnd of course, boosted MOTIVATION! \n\n[ 6-MONTH COMMITMENT ]\nImprovements in reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension are instant. After 3 months of regular practice, children gain confidence and independence. On average, our users commit to reading with Kobi for 6 months to achieve the best results. \n\nTHE LOVE FOR READING\nMotivation is key to a successful learning session. When a child is motivated they can face any obstacle. KOBI was designed to keep the child motivated for the duration of the session and beyond. With KOBI, your child can read any printed or digital text.\n\nIMPROVED READING ACCURACY\nReading accuracy is very important for reading fluency. KOBI’s features provide support that can be completely adjusted to the needs of a child. With the support of color-coded letters, the child will make fewer mistakes.\n\nFASTER READING RATE\nReading fluency and comprehension heavily depend on a smooth reading pace. Because KOBI structures texts so it is easier to read, the child’s reading rate increases dramatically.\n\nEASIER READING OF LONG, COMPLICATED WORDS\nLong, complicated words can be a real obstacle to learning. Demotivation and frustration are the usual outcomes when a child is unable to read a word successfully and at that point, the learning stops. By breaking down the text into comprehensive parts, KOBI helps your child read those complicated words and the fun can continue.\n\nWith KOBI, you can\nscan any book or import digital materials\nadjust and save the settings for several children with the same app\norganize your kid’s reading library\nimprove line tracking and focus with Focus Frame \nuse a speech synthesizer to read words\nfollow your kid's reading progress!\n\nPRICING INFORMATION\nOur users’ selection of choice is a 6-month ‘commitment’ plan. A more flexible ‘pay as you go’ monthly plan is also available. You can try the app for free with a 7-day free trial. Unless canceled, you will be automatically charged for your subscription after the trial ends.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the trial. After that subscription will automatically renew. Your account will be charged for the next period within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period unless you decide to cancel your subscription before the renewal date.\n\nYou can manage your subscription or turn off auto-renewal by going to your User Account Settings after the purchase.\n\nYou can also purchase KOBI including all it's future upgrades once and forever. This option does not include a free trial.\n\n- - - - - \nMORE INFORMATION: kobiapp.io\n\nRead our full terms of use: https://kobiapp.io/en/terms-of-use/\nand our privacy policy: https://kobiapp.io/en/privacy-policy/"

Por përveç këtyre, ju mund ti shihni edhe gjërat në vazhdim:\n\nLutje - mund të lexoni lutje të ndryshme nga mburoja e muslimanit dhe të tjera.\nKibla - tregon drejtimin drejtë kibles\nTesbih - duke zgjedhur nga dy opcionet (99 dhe pa limit), duke klikuar në ekran, numri do të rritet. Të dhënat ruhen edhe pasi të braktisni aplikacionin.\nFestat - tregon ditët e shenjta islame bashkë me datën dhe ditët e ngelura.\nLibraria - gjeni shkrime interesante dhe ese të ndryshme."

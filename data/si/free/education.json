Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "You are probably here because your child doesn’t enjoy reading that much. Reading makes them frustrated and tired. Reversing letters might be giving them a hard time, maybe they are affected by dyslexia? \n\nDaily reading practice is crucial for the development of reading skills. With KOBI, reading is enjoyable even for struggling readers.\n\n[ EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTION ] KOBI combines proven methods with innovative techniques that boost the effect of reading practice. It has been developed by a team of parents, design thinkers, and digital experts working with over 20 educational professionals. Based on scientific research and personal experience we have built a solution that helped our dyslexic kids fall in love with reading. \n\nKobi was given the coveted “Assured” badge by British Dyslexia Association, proving it provides quality support to a struggling reader. \n\nNow KOBI is here to help your child too.\n\nWith color-coded letters and other child-friendly tools, there will be:\n- no more reversing letters\n- easier blending and decoding\n- improved reading accuracy & rate - resulting in\n- better fluency & comprehension\n\nAnd of course, boosted MOTIVATION! \n\n[ 6-MONTH COMMITMENT ]\nImprovements in reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension are instant. After 3 months of regular practice, children gain confidence and independence. On average, our users commit to reading with Kobi for 6 months to achieve the best results. \n\nTHE LOVE FOR READING\nMotivation is key to a successful learning session. When a child is motivated they can face any obstacle. KOBI was designed to keep the child motivated for the duration of the session and beyond. With KOBI, your child can read any printed or digital text.\n\nIMPROVED READING ACCURACY\nReading accuracy is very important for reading fluency. KOBI’s features provide support that can be completely adjusted to the needs of a child. With the support of color-coded letters, the child will make fewer mistakes.\n\nFASTER READING RATE\nReading fluency and comprehension heavily depend on a smooth reading pace. Because KOBI structures texts so it is easier to read, the child’s reading rate increases dramatically.\n\nEASIER READING OF LONG, COMPLICATED WORDS\nLong, complicated words can be a real obstacle to learning. Demotivation and frustration are the usual outcomes when a child is unable to read a word successfully and at that point, the learning stops. By breaking down the text into comprehensive parts, KOBI helps your child read those complicated words and the fun can continue.\n\nWith KOBI, you can\nscan any book or import digital materials\nadjust and save the settings for several children with the same app\norganize your kid’s reading library\nimprove line tracking and focus with Focus Frame \nuse a speech synthesizer to read words\nfollow your kid's reading progress!\n\nPRICING INFORMATION\nOur users’ selection of choice is a 6-month ‘commitment’ plan. A more flexible ‘pay as you go’ monthly plan is also available. You can try the app for free with a 7-day free trial. Unless canceled, you will be automatically charged for your subscription after the trial ends.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the trial. After that subscription will automatically renew. Your account will be charged for the next period within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period unless you decide to cancel your subscription before the renewal date.\n\nYou can manage your subscription or turn off auto-renewal by going to your User Account Settings after the purchase.\n\nYou can also purchase KOBI including all it's future upgrades once and forever.

The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them.

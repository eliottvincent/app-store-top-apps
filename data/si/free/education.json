Na ta način boste vedno na tekočem z dogajanjem v šoli, z ocenami in aktivnostmi, bolje boste lahko povezani s procesom izobraževanja svojega otroka in pridobivanjem kompetenc.\n\nZa prijavo potrebujete geslo.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Brainscape’s SMART FLASHCARDS foster hyper-efficient studying and strong habits to DOUBLE your learning speed, with the strongest implementation of spaced repetition and active recall of any flashcard app on the planet! (And probably in the universe, assuming some super intelligent alien species out there hasn’t beaten us to it.)\n\nWith a knowledge bank created by millions of global users and experts, you can FIND, MAKE, and SHARE flashcards anytime, anywhere, and on any device, while keeping all your content meticulously ORGANIZED and seamlessly IN SYNC across web, mobile, and all your devices.\n\nHow does it work? Brainscape’s intelligent study system has been designed in accordance with decades of proven cognitive science to help you learn faster and remember longer than with any other flashcard app. (And we don’t waste time on games. Our flashcards are for serious learners.)\n\nBrainscape distills any subject down into bite-sized facts (neatly organized into decks and classes), which are posed as question-and-answer pairs, compelling you to actively recall information from scratch. You then rate how well you know each concept on a scale of 1 to 5, and Brainscape determines the perfect time interval at which to repeat that flashcard again. \n\nIf you know the answer well, you’ll see that flashcard less often; if you don’t know it well, you’ll see it again and again, at frequent intervals, until it’s deeply ingrained into your brain. And it’s this totally unique combination of active recall, self-assessment (metacognition), and spaced repetition that is scientifically proven to significantly slash your required study time!\n\nWhere do all of Brainscape’s awesome flashcards come from? Three places:\n\nTHE WORLD’S TOP EXPERTS. Brainscape partners with top publishers, schools, and educators to create comprehensive collections of certified flashcards for a diverse array of subjects, from foreign languages (we are the best language-learning tool in the world) to high-stakes exams like the AP series, MBE (bar exam), Series 7, NCLEX, MCAT, and more.\n\nYOUR PEERS. Top students, professors, teachers, tutorpreneurs, and businesses around the world have created over 1 million subjects that are available to search on Brainscape’s Knowledge Genome.\n\nYOU! You can easily create and organize thousands of multimedia flashcards featuring text, images, and even audio files, both on Brainscape’s website AND within the app itself. You can also share your decks with your classmates and collaboratively develop content together. \n\nHow much does it cost? Creating and sharing great flashcards is FREE. (Woohoo!) And for unlimited access to ALL of Brainscape's user-generated and premium, expert-curated content, as well as optional features, like bookmarks and card reversibility, you can upgrade to Pro for $19.99 (monthly), $59.99 (every 6 months), or $95.99 (annually). Alternatively, you can unlock a LIFETIME of learning with Brainscape for a one-time cost of only $199.99 American dolla billz.\n \nThe fine print: The three recurring subscriptions (monthly, semiannual, and annual) will renew automatically within 24 hours before the end of the current period, unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the period. You can cancel auto-renewal any time by going to Account Settings, and the cancellation will apply after the active subscription period is complete. Go ahead and learn more about our Terms and Privacy Policy at brainscape.com/terms.\n\nWhat’s on the horizon? It’s our vision to empower everyone, everywhere to rise to the challenge of personalized forever-learning. And for this reason, we love hearing from our community of users: it’s through your feedback that we can continue to innovate our learning platform to be more convenient, efficient, and even fun and social to use!"

      "label": "You are probably here because your child doesn’t enjoy reading that much. Reading makes them frustrated and tired. Reversing letters might be giving them a hard time, maybe they are affected by dyslexia? \n\nDaily reading practice is crucial for the development of reading skills. With KOBI, reading is enjoyable even for struggling readers.\n\n[ EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTION ] KOBI combines proven methods with innovative techniques that boost the effect of reading practice. It has been developed by a team of parents, design thinkers, and digital experts working with over 20 educational professionals. Based on scientific research and personal experience we have built a solution that helped our dyslexic kids fall in love with reading. \n\nKobi was given the coveted “Assured” badge by British Dyslexia Association, proving it provides quality support to a struggling reader. \n\nNow KOBI is here to help your child too.\n\nWith color-coded letters and other child-friendly tools, there will be:\n- no more reversing letters\n- easier blending and decoding\n- improved reading accuracy & rate - resulting in\n- better fluency & comprehension\n\nAnd of course, boosted MOTIVATION! \n\n[ 6-MONTH COMMITMENT ]\nImprovements in reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension are instant. After 3 months of regular practice, children gain confidence and independence. On average, our users commit to reading with Kobi for 6 months to achieve the best results. \n\nTHE LOVE FOR READING\nMotivation is key to a successful learning session. When a child is motivated they can face any obstacle. KOBI was designed to keep the child motivated for the duration of the session and beyond. With KOBI, your child can read any printed or digital text.\n\nIMPROVED READING ACCURACY\nReading accuracy is very important for reading fluency. KOBI’s features provide support that can be completely adjusted to the needs of a child. With the support of color-coded letters, the child will make fewer mistakes.\n\nFASTER READING RATE\nReading fluency and comprehension heavily depend on a smooth reading pace. Because KOBI structures texts so it is easier to read, the child’s reading rate increases dramatically.\n\nEASIER READING OF LONG, COMPLICATED WORDS\nLong, complicated words can be a real obstacle to learning. Demotivation and frustration are the usual outcomes when a child is unable to read a word successfully and at that point, the learning stops. By breaking down the text into comprehensive parts, KOBI helps your child read those complicated words and the fun can continue.\n\nWith KOBI, you can\nscan any book or import digital materials\nadjust and save the settings for several children with the same app\norganize your kid’s reading library\nimprove line tracking and focus with Focus Frame \nuse a speech synthesizer to read words\nfollow your kid's reading progress!\n\nPRICING INFORMATION\nOur users’ selection of choice is a 6-month ‘commitment’ plan. A more flexible ‘pay as you go’ monthly plan is also available. You can try the app for free with a 7-day free trial. Unless canceled, you will be automatically charged for your subscription after the trial ends.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the trial. After that subscription will automatically renew. Your account will be charged for the next period within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period unless you decide to cancel your subscription before the renewal date.\n\nYou can manage your subscription or turn off auto-renewal by going to your User Account Settings after the purchase.\n\nYou can also purchase KOBI including all it's future upgrades once and forever.

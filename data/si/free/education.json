      "label": "The Arduino Science Journal (formerly Science Journal, an initiative by Google) is free and allows you to gather data about the world around you by harnessing the sensors in your smartphone as well as sensors connected to Arduino. The Science Journal transforms smartphones and tablets into science notebooks that encourage students to explore their world.\n\nThe Arduino Science Journal app is recommended for students from 10 to 18 years of age.\n\nAbout Arduino Science Journal\nWith the Arduino Science Journal, you can learn interactively, conduct experiments and iterate on findings.\n\n•  Enhance your existing lesson plans: use the Science Journal with activities and assignments you have already prepared\n•  Classroom & home-school friendly: you don’t have to be in a classroom setting to start exploring. The Arduino Science Journal can be used to run experiments straight away, as long as you have your smartphone or tablet with you! \n•  Move learning outside: the use of mobile devices along with the types of experiments we offer encourage students to get out of their seats and open their eyes to the world around them through the power of science\n•  Science and data have no secrets: you can easily record your observations, store your data sensors in real-time and analyse them, just as a proper scientist! \n•  Connect the digital and the physical world from your pocket: go through a series of simple tutorials and start having fun with science\n\nWith built-in device sensors as well as external hardware, you can measure light, sound, movement, and much more.  You can also compare results, and even set triggers. \n\nTogether with the external hardware, (not included with the app), students are enabled to conduct more complex experiments, and advance in their scientific studies. As long as the external sensors are compatible with a Bluetooth-connecting device such as a microcontroller, there is no end to what experiments the students can make. Some popular sensors that the app can work with are: light, conductivity, temperature, force, gas, heart rate, respiration, radiation, pressure, magnetism, and many more.\n\nThe app is classroom-friendly, since students can sign in on any device and access their experiments to continue exploring the world, wherever they are!\n\nIf you’re an educator with a Google Classroom account, you can also subscribe to the Teacher Plan, which allows you to integrate the app with Google Classroom and share this integration with your students. You can then create assignments, templates, and experiments in the app and import existing classes from Google Classroom.\n\nPermissions notice:\n\n• Bluetooth: needed to scan for Bluetooth sensor devices.\n• Camera: needed to take pictures to document experiments and for the brightness sensor.\n• Photo Library: needed to store pictures taken to document experiments and for adding existing photos from your library to experiments.\n• Microphone: needed for sound intensity sensor.\n• Push notifications: needed to inform you of recording status when backgrounding the app.\n\nBenefits of using the Arduino Science Journal\n• It’s free and simple to use\n• Easy setup: download the app and start exploring with your phone’s built-in sensors\n• Cross-platform support\n• Portable: enhance your home learning or bring your device outside to study the world around you\n• Safe for children to use: COPPA Compliance underway \n• Fully compatible with Arduino hardware: keep experimenting with the Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab, as well as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board\n• Google Drive integration, as well as local download\n\n---\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.arduino.cc/en/sj-terms-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy\nChildren's Privacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/children-privacy-policy"

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

When you open application first time, you can either type in school code \"demo\" just to see how it looks or type in your real school code: this can be found by asking your school administration or by checking the code at the bottom right corner of Wise Timetable desktop web application (near to icons for appropriate application store).\n\nAfter selecting the school (by entering its code), you need to select your student group(s) or lecturer name.\n\nBy default, day view is set to the current date (and hour) and you can see your daily timetable. A weekly view can be turned on simply by turning your phone horizontally or use the menu at the left side (slide menu or use top menu) where you can select also a monthly timetable view. \n\nAt the main menu, you can see all the alerts sent to you or connected to courses you are going to. These alerts are also embedded into timetable and can be spotted by \"!\" icon in the timetable event corner.\n\nYour student group(s) or lecturer name setting can be always changed in Settings menu - to reflect your current year or subject area.\n\nAll the timetable events are shown in a blue color (blue boxes) next to corresponding hour. By tapping on these events you will get a detailed description. Non-lecture events like exam reservation or other custom events set by school administration are shown in light blue color.\n\nTo make this timetable view complete, please include your external calendars into the school timetable view. You can make this easily selecting a Settings menu and then set external calendars you want to see inside your timetable. They will be shown as green boxes. All day external calendar events (like birthday or holidays) will be shown at the day beginning, other will be shown at their exact hour. External calendars can be always turned on or off by selecting menu option at the top right corner above the timetable view.\n\nIn weekly view, you are able to control if weekdays are displayed (weekday names are always displayed with light red background).\n\nTo quickly go to the current date (today), you can click on the icon at the right top - with today's date number inside the icon.\n\nOf course, navigation is done by simply dragging the view left or right and it works in daily, weekly or monthly timetable view.\n\nHope You will really enjoy with this application and we promise every improvement you want will be seriously considered and in most cases also implemented. So please do not hesitate to send your comments to info_wise@wise-t.com. Wise Technologies Ltd. will listen and act ;)"

The app provides online access to a choice of code editors for programming your micro:bit and, when your program is ready, the app beams it to the micro:bit via Bluetooth wireless.  Easy-to-follow screens lead you through the process of pairing your iPad (or iPhone) to the micro:bit and then transferring your program code.  \nCompared with previous versions,  the micro:bit app Version 3 contains these additional features:\n•\tPair with any number of micro:bits\n•\tChoose which micro:bit is currently connected\n•\tStore HEX files in the app\n•\tChoose a HEX file for flashing\n•\tExport and delete HEX files\n•\tImport stored HEX files directly into JavaScript Blocks editor\n•\tRapid download from JavaScript Blocks editor\n•\tMonitor data detected by micro:bit sensors\n•\tUse the range of micro:bit Bluetooth services in real time\n•\tDisplay messages on the micro:bit LEDs\n•\tSend control commands to the micro:bit buttons and pins\n•\tDe-bug your program code while it is running in the micro:bit\n•\tUse a simulated gamepad to send commands to the micro:bit\n•\tView camera images ready for taking photos or video\n\nAs well as providing more flexible handling of your program scripts and HEX files, a major addition in Version 3 is the Monitor and Control page.  This lets you observe real-time data from the micro:bit sensors, send messages directly to the LEDs and control the micro:bit buttons and pins from your iPad or iPhone.  Monitor is ideal for exploiting Bluetooth services in real time, and for de-bugging your program code while it is running in the micro:bit.\n\nThe MakeCode code editor now requires iOS 13 or later."

Treninge, ki jih potrebujete za delo v vašem podjetju, opravite enostavno s pametno napravo iz Vaše dnevne sobe.\n\n2. V ZNANJU JE MOČ. VEČ ZNANJA= VEČJA KAKOVOST \nŽivimo v času hitrih sprememb in nenehnih novosti. Zato je danes vedeti več še toliko bolj pomembno. V znanju je moč, ki vam je nihče ne more vzeti in mi vas bogatimo skozi strokovne in aktualne vsebine.\n\n3. INOVATIVNO UČNO OKOLJE\nAplikacija vam omogoča, da imate zbrane posamezne online treninge in gradiva na enem mestu. Z inovativnim pristopom k učenju - skozi online igranje kviza  - s prikazom učnih kartic, kjer uporabnik neobremenjeno in v udobju okolja, ki ga izbere, pridobiva kompetence.\n\nSEIC MICRO strategija učenja s pomočjo mikro treningov\nS pomočjo aplikacije SEIC MICRO in metode mikro treninga se različne vsebine znanj pripravlja celovito in poglablja s kratkimi in aktivnimi trening koraki.\nKlasična oblika mikro treninga za učenje uporablja algoritem. Vprašanja se obdelujejo v naključnem vrstnem redu. Če je vprašanje odgovorjeno napačno, se bo ponavljalo, vse dokler ni pravilno odgovorjeno trikrat zapored v lekciji. To ustvarja trajnostni učinek učenja.\n\nPoleg osnovnega učenja je ponujeno tudi stopenjsko učenje. V ta namen sistem samodejno razdeli učne kartice na tri ravni in jih naključno dodeli udeležencu treninga. Med posameznimi stopnjami je zagotovljena tako imenovana \"faza počitka\" v časovni obliki. To je potrebno, da bi dosegli združljivost med stopnjami in trajnostni efekt učenja. Končni test prikaže, kje je prišlo do napredka pri učenju in kje so možne vrzeli znanja. Test se lahko prilagodi, če je potrebno.\n\nKot tretja možnost pa se lahko uči tudi direktno z opravljanjem testa, brez izrecnega predhodnega učenja z aplikacijo SEIC MICRO.\n\nMotivator za učenje - kviz in / ali učenje skozi tekmovanje\nUsposabljanje na SEIC MICRO je sproščeno in navdihuje. Z možnostjo kvizov se izvaja igriv pristop k učenju. Druge uporabnike lahko na primer povabimo na tekmovanje ali dvoboj. Učenje je tako lahko še bolj zabavno. Primer  take igre je: V treh sklopih vprašanj, vsak s sklop s tremi vprašanji, določimo kdo je kralj znanja.\n\nPogovor skozi  funkcijo klepeta\nFunkcija klepeta v aplikaciji uporabnikom omogoča izmenjavo mnenj pri sejah posameznega treninga."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

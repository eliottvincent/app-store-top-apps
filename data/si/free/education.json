From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Want to get a handle on SQL, or let yourself loose with Linux? Then let Enki be your coding coach, setting you daily workouts that tackle the intricacies of coding languages in bite-sized steps. **\n- Apple's App Store; featured as app of the day in 100+ countries\n\n** Compared to free reading options this is structured, personalized content.

We work with influencers to improve their ability to speak by simulating a live stream environment. Live environments simulate large amounts of viewers also known as hype, clout, or fame.

Parallel - Live SIMULATES live feeds and provides a gamified learning experience to improve speech and engagement.\n\nFor managers of influencers and professors of communication, you may have your students record their speaking session. They can be sent to you for further analysis along with our report. This makes learning fun while feeling clout, fame, or hype associated with engaged simulated live environments. \n\nThe environment is completely controlled and does not require internet to use. We are not affiliated with any other social media platforms. We are an educational game aimed at improving your ability to speak."

      "label": "SafeExamBrowser (SEB) is a secure kiosk web browser environment used to carry out e-assessments that run on exam servers. SEB opens a web browser without an address and search bar, loads a pre-configured webpage and locks an iPad (or iPhone or iPod Touch) into a single app kiosk mode. This mode prevents students from switching to other apps, accessing websites and communicating with other students during an exam. SEB enables secure exams on unmanaged iOS devices like students' own iPads as well as on iOS devices owned and managed by an institution. SEB doesn't use a centralized server or cloud service; it can be configured with an API, config files and config links. It can be used with most web-based quiz and e-assessment systems. For improved security and usability, some exam systems provide additional built-in support for SEB. Currently, SEB integrates especially well with learning management systems (LMS) such as Moodle, ILIAS, OpenOLAT and with several non-commercial and commercial exam systems, such as Inspera Assessment, Dugga, Exam.net or EvaExam.\n\nSEB uses one of the single app modes provided by iOS. After an exam is submitted, SEB can automatically end the app self-lock kiosk mode (an exam invigilator could also use a quit password to end the SEB exam session and unlock the device if necessary). \n\nSEB features an optional Dock displaying buttons for various commands. Instead or in addition, a left slider menu shows a list of open browser tabs and commands which can be used to (if enabled in settings) quit an exam session, jump back to the start page of an exam, reload a web page or search text on it, and navigate back/forward in the browsing history. \n\nSEB for iOS uses the same format for encrypted .seb configuration files as the SEB versions for other platforms. Those config files allow to individually configure SEB to display the start page of an exam system or an exam portal page with a list of links to current exams. If SEB for iOS is installed using a mobile device management (MDM) system, its initial configuration can easily be deployed using the \"MDM Managed Configuration\" feature. You can also directly start an exam with an individual configuration in SEB for iOS using a special config hyperlink. This link can be opened by examinees from Safari, Mail or a messenger app. In addition, you can use QR codes containing SEB links. An exam can directly be started in SEB by using the iOS Camera app or the built-in QR code scanner. \n\nSEB also works together with Apple Classroom, teachers can start individually configured exams on all student devices. See https://safeexambrowser.org/ios for more information.\n\n\nSafeExamBrowser for iOS was developed by Daniel R. Schneider, ETH Zurich, Educational Development and Technology (LET), based on the original idea of Safe Exam Browser by Stefan Schneider, University of Giessen\nProject concept: Thomas Piendl, Daniel R. Schneider, Damian Büchel, Andreas Hefti, Dirk Bauer, Michael Kern, Kai Reuter, Tobias Halbherr, Karsten Burger, Marco Lehre, Brigitte Schmucki, Oliver Rahs.\n\nSafe Exam Browser is released as freeware. The code is subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may only use these files in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/ .\n\nImportant parts of this project have been carried out as part of the program \"AAA/SWITCH – e-Infrastructure for e-Science\" led by SWITCH, the Swiss National Research and Education Network and the cooperative project \"Learning Infrastructure\" (part of the CRUS program \"Information scientifique: accès, traitement et sauvegarde\") coordinated by SWITCH, and was supported by funds from the ETH Board and the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)."

We do not just publish videos & articles in a random order - we arrange them within coherent, well-structured courses. \nAnd if you finish a course, for example on how to become rock solid in defending, you earn badges. Your progress in the different courses will be tracked, so you’ll always have a good overview. \nLast but not least you will also find many like-minded players to engage with in the comment sections and our regular group coaching sessions. The group coaching sessions are held on our exclusive Discord server with professional coaches. \nWelcome to next level of gaming education.

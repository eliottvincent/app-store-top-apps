Na ta način boste vedno na tekočem z dogajanjem v šoli, z ocenami in aktivnostmi, bolje boste lahko povezani s procesom izobraževanja svojega otroka in pridobivanjem kompetenc.\n\nZa prijavo potrebujete geslo.

When you open application first time, you can either type in school code \"demo\" just to see how it looks or type in your real school code: this can be found by asking your school administration or by checking the code at the bottom right corner of Wise Timetable desktop web application (near to icons for appropriate application store).\n\nAfter selecting the school (by entering its code), you need to select your student group(s) or lecturer name.\n\nBy default, day view is set to the current date (and hour) and you can see your daily timetable. A weekly view can be turned on simply by turning your phone horizontally or use the menu at the left side (slide menu or use top menu) where you can select also a monthly timetable view. \n\nAt the main menu, you can see all the alerts sent to you or connected to courses you are going to. These alerts are also embedded into timetable and can be spotted by \"!\" icon in the timetable event corner.\n\nYour student group(s) or lecturer name setting can be always changed in Settings menu - to reflect your current year or subject area.\n\nAll the timetable events are shown in a blue color (blue boxes) next to corresponding hour. By tapping on these events you will get a detailed description. Non-lecture events like exam reservation or other custom events set by school administration are shown in light blue color.\n\nTo make this timetable view complete, please include your external calendars into the school timetable view. You can make this easily selecting a Settings menu and then set external calendars you want to see inside your timetable. They will be shown as green boxes. All day external calendar events (like birthday or holidays) will be shown at the day beginning, other will be shown at their exact hour. External calendars can be always turned on or off by selecting menu option at the top right corner above the timetable view.\n\nIn weekly view, you are able to control if weekdays are displayed (weekday names are always displayed with light red background).\n\nTo quickly go to the current date (today), you can click on the icon at the right top - with today's date number inside the icon.\n\nOf course, navigation is done by simply dragging the view left or right and it works in daily, weekly or monthly timetable view.\n\nHope You will really enjoy with this application and we promise every improvement you want will be seriously considered and in most cases also implemented. So please do not hesitate to send your comments to info_wise@wise-t.com. Wise Technologies Ltd. will listen and act ;)"

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

Over 1 million bright minds saved more than 14 million ideas in their personal library so far.\n\nIt's like your social media feed, if your social media feed had things that mattered :-)\n\nKnowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.\n\nIdeas are created by Deepstash members, called stashers. Whenever a stasher reads a book article or listens to a podcast and they find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, they will add an idea about it in Deepstash.\n\nA daily source of inspiring & life changing stories and ideas. Read articles, learn skills, get productivity tips and discover life hacks. The magic of Deepstash is that everything you do builds your knowledge library: be it contributing  your own ideas or collecting idea cards from other stashers. Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.\n\nPERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS\n\nChoose a few topics of interest (more than 4,000 topics to choose from) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.\n\nThe more you save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.\n\nBUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nYou can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.\n\nSearch and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes, which are basically collections of insights stocked up and ready to go for when you need them: a Powerpoint presentation, a new job interview, a date, a project at work, or negotiating your rent with the landlord.\n\nSHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nAdd your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.\n\nShare your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this. \n\nShare a link to ideas or just an image. We built special image formats for each social network (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and others) so your ideas will look their best.\n\nNO ADS. NO DISTRACTIONS\n\nThe Deepstash app is free and open to everyone. Get a clean reading experience and focus on the content instead of being distracted with annoying ads. Just get a quick free account (Facebook & Google login) and you’re good to go.\n\nGood for your career. \nGreat for your life. \nGive it a shot!\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://deepstash.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://deepstash.com/privacy-policy"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Osnovni cilj projekta jeste da svako može brzo i lahko dobiti sve odgovore putem elektronske forme. Za razliku od papirne forme tefsira koja nam je svima dostupna i u kojoj je teže traženje željenih stvari, ova elektronska forma je dosta lakša, brža. Samo jednim klikom na željeni index ili poglavlje, dobijete sve ajete za traženi pojam. Mi smo shodno vezama indexa i poglavlja s jedne strane i ajeta s druge strane sa kraja knjige to već povezali. Iskreno se nadamo da ćemo pomoći svima studentima, mualimima, istraživačima, profesorima i učenicima da lakše urade svoj zadatak ili neki istraživački rad koji se tiče Kur'ana."

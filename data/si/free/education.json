Na ta način boste vedno na tekočem z dogajanjem v šoli, z ocenami in aktivnostmi, bolje boste lahko povezani s procesom izobraževanja svojega otroka in pridobivanjem kompetenc.\n\nZa prijavo potrebujete geslo. Za geslo za osnovni vpogled se obrnite na šolo. Če geslo za Lo.Polis že imate (za odjavo malice, izbor izbirnih predmetov, naročilo dijaške izkaznice ter prijavo v e-redovalnico) bo vaše geslo delovalo na spletnem portalu in aplikaciji."

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

Lots of astronomers and night sky photographers worldwide have chosen the app to help them in planning their nights out for watching stars, planets and constellations.\n\nAll necessary info is available at once: what planets, bright stars and constellations will be above the horizon at night, what the weather is like, what the visibility score is, and much more. After setting the location you can check the stargazing index for the whole week ahead and learn the best time for the night out. \n\nThe unique index for stargazing conditions is calculated hourly and renews each time you start the app. The index depends on the following criteria:\n\n- Weather forecast\n- Light Pollution\n- Visible objects\n- The Moonlight​\n\nThe Sky Live app works in pair with Star Walk 2 that means you can see the chosen object in the sky and check more info about its’ path through the night sky. Sky Live also has an Apple Watch extension to alert you of upcoming astronomical events and tell you what’s going on in the sky over your location at the moment, e.g. ISS flyby or bright Iridium flare.\n\n\"For stargazers, Sky Live is exactly the app we've always needed to find out just how much of the stars we can see at night and when we'll be able to see our favourite constellations and planets.\" by Nathan Snelgrove, AppStorm.net.\n\nStunning space photos combined with everything you need to know about stargazing conditions for your location tonight. Stargazer or not - this app will spark your curiosity. \n\nThe most accurate hourly conditions for stargazing are estimated on seven criteria and summarized in one Stargazing Index that will give you all the information you need to make your plans. The formula was developed by a mathematician on the Star Walk team and takes into account: \n\n- Is there anything interesting in the sky tonight? \n- Can I see Saturn? \n- Is it going to be cloudy? \n- Is it going to rain? \n- Too much light? \n- Is the Moon too bright for stargazing? \n\nYou will also get detailed reports on position and trajectory of the International Space Station, the Sun, the Moon, Jupiter and other planets. The forecast is available for seven days ahead."

      "label": "You are probably here because your child doesn’t enjoy reading that much. Reading makes them frustrated and tired. Reversing letters might be giving them a hard time, maybe they are affected by dyslexia? \n\nDaily reading practice is crucial for the development of reading skills. With KOBI, reading is enjoyable even for struggling readers.\n\n[ EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTION ] KOBI combines proven methods with innovative techniques that boost the effect of reading practice. It has been developed by a team of parents, design thinkers, and digital experts working with over 20 educational professionals. Based on scientific research and personal experience we have built a solution that helped our dyslexic kids fall in love with reading. \n\nKobi was given the coveted “Assured” badge by British Dyslexia Association, proving it provides quality support to a struggling reader. \n\nNow KOBI is here to help your child too.\n\nWith color-coded letters and other child-friendly tools, there will be:\n- no more reversing letters\n- easier blending and decoding\n- improved reading accuracy & rate - resulting in\n- better fluency & comprehension\n\nAnd of course, boosted MOTIVATION! \n\n[ 6-MONTH COMMITMENT ]\nImprovements in reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension are instant. After 3 months of regular practice, children gain confidence and independence. On average, our users commit to reading with Kobi for 6 months to achieve the best results. \n\nTHE LOVE FOR READING\nMotivation is key to a successful learning session. When a child is motivated they can face any obstacle. KOBI was designed to keep the child motivated for the duration of the session and beyond. With KOBI, your child can read any printed or digital text.\n\nIMPROVED READING ACCURACY\nReading accuracy is very important for reading fluency. KOBI’s features provide support that can be completely adjusted to the needs of a child. With the support of color-coded letters, the child will make fewer mistakes.\n\nFASTER READING RATE\nReading fluency and comprehension heavily depend on a smooth reading pace. Because KOBI structures texts so it is easier to read, the child’s reading rate increases dramatically.\n\nEASIER READING OF LONG, COMPLICATED WORDS\nLong, complicated words can be a real obstacle to learning. Demotivation and frustration are the usual outcomes when a child is unable to read a word successfully and at that point, the learning stops. By breaking down the text into comprehensive parts, KOBI helps your child read those complicated words and the fun can continue.\n\nWith KOBI, you can\nscan any book or import digital materials\nadjust and save the settings for several children with the same app\norganize your kid’s reading library\nimprove line tracking and focus with Focus Frame \nuse a speech synthesizer to read words\nfollow your kid's reading progress!\n\nPRICING INFORMATION\nOur users’ selection of choice is a 6-month ‘commitment’ plan. A more flexible ‘pay as you go’ monthly plan is also available. You can try the app for free with a 7-day free trial. Unless canceled, you will be automatically charged for your subscription after the trial ends.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the trial. After that subscription will automatically renew. Your account will be charged for the next period within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period unless you decide to cancel your subscription before the renewal date.\n\nYou can manage your subscription or turn off auto-renewal by going to your User Account Settings after the purchase.\n\nYou can also purchase KOBI including all it's future upgrades once and forever.

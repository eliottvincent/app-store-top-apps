Portal smo nadgradili, tako da lahko na enem mestu prejemate obvestila, gradiva in različne dokumente s strani šole, si izmenjujete sporočila z učitelji, urejate prehrano, imate vpogled v ocene, domače naloge, urnike ipd.\n\nS portalom želimo izboljšati komunikacijo med učitelji in starši oz. učenci/dijaki. Na ta način boste vedno na tekočem z dogajanjem v šoli, z ocenami in aktivnostmi, bolje boste lahko povezani s procesom izobraževanja svojega otroka in pridobivanjem kompetenc.\n\nZa prijavo potrebujete geslo. Za geslo za osnovni vpogled se obrnite na šolo. Če geslo za Lo.Polis že imate (za odjavo malice, izbor izbirnih predmetov, naročilo dijaške izkaznice ter prijavo v e-redovalnico) bo vaše geslo delovalo na spletnem portalu in aplikaciji."

      "label": "Lingvist is the language learning app built by scientists and language experts that teaches vocabulary better than anyone else in the world. The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

      "label": "TajweedMate is the first app ever that helps you recite the Holy Qur'an with Tajweed, by not only audio examples, but also listening to your recitation and analyzing it. To achieve this, TM uses a state of the art speech recognition engine specifically developed for this very purpose. During the training process of the Speech Recognition Engine, more than 40 Qaarii's recitations are utilized.\n\n\nWith TajweedMate App, you can\n\n- Learn alphabet and basic recitation of the Holy Qur'an with audio examples.\n- Learn Tajweed with rules, audio-visual examples.\n- Test your recitation by smart speech analysis.\n- Memorize the most common passages from the Holy Qur'an.\n- Free for limited time.\n\n\nTajweedMate\n\n- Makes speech analysis completely offline, thanks to its advanced (and even improving) engine already included in the app.\n- Strictly respects user's privacy. (See our Privacy Policy on tajweedmate.com/privacy.html)\n\n\nNote: This revolutionary app still gets improved by your contributions. Please encourage us, and in case of an issue inform us via e-mail or other social media accounts. We will try our best!"

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

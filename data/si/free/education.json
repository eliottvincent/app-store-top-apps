Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture. In contrast to a geo-cache or a scavenger hunt Actionbound requires the players to create their own content."

Sodelavci SEIC Ptuj prav tako uporabljajo aplikacijo za svoja interna usposabljanja.\n\n3X zakaj mobilna aplikacija SEIC MICRO:\n\n1.UČENJE KJERKOLI IN KADARKOLI, ZA VSE UČNE TIPE\nUčenje ni bilo nikoli tako enostavno in učinkovito. Treninge, ki jih potrebujete za delo v vašem podjetju, opravite enostavno s pametno napravo iz Vaše dnevne sobe.\n\n2. V ZNANJU JE MOČ. VEČ ZNANJA= VEČJA KAKOVOST \nŽivimo v času hitrih sprememb in nenehnih novosti. Zato je danes vedeti več še toliko bolj pomembno. V znanju je moč, ki vam je nihče ne more vzeti in mi vas bogatimo skozi strokovne in aktualne vsebine.\n\n3. INOVATIVNO UČNO OKOLJE\nAplikacija vam omogoča, da imate zbrane posamezne online treninge in gradiva na enem mestu. Z inovativnim pristopom k učenju - skozi online igranje kviza  - s prikazom učnih kartic, kjer uporabnik neobremenjeno in v udobju okolja, ki ga izbere, pridobiva kompetence.\n\nSEIC MICRO strategija učenja s pomočjo mikro treningov\nS pomočjo aplikacije SEIC MICRO in metode mikro treninga se različne vsebine znanj pripravlja celovito in poglablja s kratkimi in aktivnimi trening koraki.\nKlasična oblika mikro treninga za učenje uporablja algoritem. Vprašanja se obdelujejo v naključnem vrstnem redu. Če je vprašanje odgovorjeno napačno, se bo ponavljalo, vse dokler ni pravilno odgovorjeno trikrat zapored v lekciji. To ustvarja trajnostni učinek učenja.\n\nPoleg osnovnega učenja je ponujeno tudi stopenjsko učenje. V ta namen sistem samodejno razdeli učne kartice na tri ravni in jih naključno dodeli udeležencu treninga. Med posameznimi stopnjami je zagotovljena tako imenovana \"faza počitka\" v časovni obliki. To je potrebno, da bi dosegli združljivost med stopnjami in trajnostni efekt učenja. Končni test prikaže, kje je prišlo do napredka pri učenju in kje so možne vrzeli znanja. Test se lahko prilagodi, če je potrebno.\n\nKot tretja možnost pa se lahko uči tudi direktno z opravljanjem testa, brez izrecnega predhodnega učenja z aplikacijo SEIC MICRO.\n\nMotivator za učenje - kviz in / ali učenje skozi tekmovanje\nUsposabljanje na SEIC MICRO je sproščeno in navdihuje. Z možnostjo kvizov se izvaja igriv pristop k učenju. Druge uporabnike lahko na primer povabimo na tekmovanje ali dvoboj. Učenje je tako lahko še bolj zabavno. Primer  take igre je: V treh sklopih vprašanj, vsak s sklop s tremi vprašanji, določimo kdo je kralj znanja.\n\nPogovor skozi  funkcijo klepeta\nFunkcija klepeta v aplikaciji uporabnikom omogoča izmenjavo mnenj pri sejah posameznega treninga."

No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

Qëllimi kryesorë i aplikacionit është tregimi i kohës së namazit duke u bazuar në takvimat zyrtarë për shtetet si Kosova, Shqipëria dhe Maqedonia e Veriut. Gjithashtu tregohet takvimi edhe për vendet evropiane si Zvicra, Gjermania dhe Italia. Por përveç këtyre, ju mund ti shihni edhe gjërat në vazhdim:\n\nLutje - mund të lexoni lutje të ndryshme nga mburoja e muslimanit dhe të tjera.\nKibla - tregon drejtimin drejtë kibles\nTesbih - duke zgjedhur nga dy opcionet (99 dhe pa limit), duke klikuar në ekran, numri do të rritet. Të dhënat ruhen edhe pasi të braktisni aplikacionin.\nFestat - tregon ditët e shenjta islame bashkë me datën dhe ditët e ngelura.\nLibraria - gjeni shkrime interesante dhe ese të ndryshme."

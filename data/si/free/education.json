When you open application first time, you can either type in school code \"demo\" just to see how it looks or type in your real school code: this can be found by asking your school administration or by checking the code at the bottom right corner of Wise Timetable desktop web application (near to icons for appropriate application store).\n\nAfter selecting the school (by entering its code), you need to select your student group(s) or lecturer name.\n\nBy default, day view is set to the current date (and hour) and you can see your daily timetable. A weekly view can be turned on simply by turning your phone horizontally or use the menu at the left side (slide menu or use top menu) where you can select also a monthly timetable view. \n\nAt the main menu, you can see all the alerts sent to you or connected to courses you are going to. These alerts are also embedded into timetable and can be spotted by \"!\" icon in the timetable event corner.\n\nYour student group(s) or lecturer name setting can be always changed in Settings menu - to reflect your current year or subject area.\n\nAll the timetable events are shown in a blue color (blue boxes) next to corresponding hour. By tapping on these events you will get a detailed description. Non-lecture events like exam reservation or other custom events set by school administration are shown in light blue color.\n\nTo make this timetable view complete, please include your external calendars into the school timetable view. You can make this easily selecting a Settings menu and then set external calendars you want to see inside your timetable. They will be shown as green boxes. All day external calendar events (like birthday or holidays) will be shown at the day beginning, other will be shown at their exact hour. External calendars can be always turned on or off by selecting menu option at the top right corner above the timetable view.\n\nIn weekly view, you are able to control if weekdays are displayed (weekday names are always displayed with light red background).\n\nTo quickly go to the current date (today), you can click on the icon at the right top - with today's date number inside the icon.\n\nOf course, navigation is done by simply dragging the view left or right and it works in daily, weekly or monthly timetable view.\n\nHope You will really enjoy with this application and we promise every improvement you want will be seriously considered and in most cases also implemented. So please do not hesitate to send your comments to info_wise@wise-t.com. Wise Technologies Ltd. will listen and act ;)"

Tap the cap and map to zap them away!)\n-OP (Visit the pop shop to pop the popcorn til it reaches the top of the bucket!)\n-IT (Hit the rocks to split them into bits so they fit into the pit!)\n-ET (Catch the pets in the net so they don't get wet; then load them onto a jet!)\n-EN (Move the ten hens into the pen where ten men can feed them!)\n-AG (Drage the rags into the bags, and then tag each bag!)\n-UB (Scrub and rub each cub in the tub until it's clean!)\n-IP (Dip the chips and watch the dip drip as you feed the little guys.)\n-OCK (Visit the dock to knock over the towers of blocks and rocks, and then put them into the socks!)\n-ACK (The snacks are arriving on a track. Stack them on a rack!)\n-IN (The pictures arrive in a bin. Pin them each to the wall, and then spin them away!)\n-UG (Tug the plug from each jug so the bug can crawl free!)\n\nLetters, sounds, and phonic patterns are introduced and practiced in contexts that are playful and appealing to children, yet give meaning and purpose to the skills they learn.  Children practice purposefully sequenced skills and identify word patterns, learning to recognize the words so they can read about what they do and observe. The contexts and activities keep children engaged with constant variety in the way they present and illustrate word meanings.  Each captures children’s interest and invites them to read and create words that describe or explain it.  Developed at Brigham Young University by those who created and administer the Systematic and Engaging Early Literacy (SEEL) classroom program, Hideout replicates the kind of interactive face-to-face lessons that are taught by SEEL teachers and available on the SEEL  website (education.byu.edu/seel)."

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "You are probably here because your child doesn’t enjoy reading that much. Reading makes them frustrated and tired. Reversing letters might be giving them a hard time, maybe they are affected by dyslexia? \n\nDaily reading practice is crucial for the development of reading skills. With KOBI, reading is enjoyable even for struggling readers.\n\n[ EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTION ] KOBI combines proven methods with innovative techniques that boost the effect of reading practice. It has been developed by a team of parents, design thinkers, and digital experts working with over 20 educational professionals. Based on scientific research and personal experience we have built a solution that helped our dyslexic kids fall in love with reading. \n\nKobi was given the coveted “Assured” badge by British Dyslexia Association, proving it provides quality support to a struggling reader. \n\nNow KOBI is here to help your child too.\n\nWith color-coded letters and other child-friendly tools, there will be:\n- no more reversing letters\n- easier blending and decoding\n- improved reading accuracy & rate - resulting in\n- better fluency & comprehension\n\nAnd of course, boosted MOTIVATION! \n\n[ 6-MONTH COMMITMENT ]\nImprovements in reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension are instant. After 3 months of regular practice, children gain confidence and independence. On average, our users commit to reading with Kobi for 6 months to achieve the best results. \n\nTHE LOVE FOR READING\nMotivation is key to a successful learning session. When a child is motivated they can face any obstacle. KOBI was designed to keep the child motivated for the duration of the session and beyond. With KOBI, your child can read any printed or digital text.\n\nIMPROVED READING ACCURACY\nReading accuracy is very important for reading fluency. KOBI’s features provide support that can be completely adjusted to the needs of a child. With the support of color-coded letters, the child will make fewer mistakes.\n\nFASTER READING RATE\nReading fluency and comprehension heavily depend on a smooth reading pace. Because KOBI structures texts so it is easier to read, the child’s reading rate increases dramatically.\n\nEASIER READING OF LONG, COMPLICATED WORDS\nLong, complicated words can be a real obstacle to learning. Demotivation and frustration are the usual outcomes when a child is unable to read a word successfully and at that point, the learning stops. By breaking down the text into comprehensive parts, KOBI helps your child read those complicated words and the fun can continue.\n\nWith KOBI, you can\nscan any book or import digital materials\nadjust and save the settings for several children with the same app\norganize your kid’s reading library\nimprove line tracking and focus with Focus Frame \nuse a speech synthesizer to read words\nfollow your kid's reading progress!\n\nPRICING INFORMATION\nOur users’ selection of choice is a 6-month ‘commitment’ plan. A more flexible ‘pay as you go’ monthly plan is also available. You can try the app for free with a 7-day free trial. Unless canceled, you will be automatically charged for your subscription after the trial ends.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the trial. After that subscription will automatically renew. Your account will be charged for the next period within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period unless you decide to cancel your subscription before the renewal date.\n\nYou can manage your subscription or turn off auto-renewal by going to your User Account Settings after the purchase.\n\nYou can also purchase KOBI including all it's future upgrades once and forever.

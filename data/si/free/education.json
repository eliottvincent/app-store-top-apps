      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Over 1 million bright minds saved more than 14 million ideas in their personal library so far.\n\nIt's like your social media feed, if your social media feed had things that mattered :-)\n\nKnowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.\n\nIdeas are created by Deepstash members, called stashers. Whenever a stasher reads a book article or listens to a podcast and they find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, they will add an idea about it in Deepstash.\n\nA daily source of inspiring & life changing stories and ideas. Read articles, learn skills, get productivity tips and discover life hacks. The magic of Deepstash is that everything you do builds your knowledge library: be it contributing  your own ideas or collecting idea cards from other stashers. Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.\n\nPERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS\n\nChoose a few topics of interest (more than 4,000 topics to choose from) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.\n\nThe more you save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.\n\nBUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nYou can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.\n\nSearch and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes, which are basically collections of insights stocked up and ready to go for when you need them: a Powerpoint presentation, a new job interview, a date, a project at work, or negotiating your rent with the landlord.\n\nSHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nAdd your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.\n\nShare your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this. \n\nShare a link to ideas or just an image. We built special image formats for each social network (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and others) so your ideas will look their best.\n\nNO ADS. NO DISTRACTIONS\n\nThe Deepstash app is free and open to everyone. Get a clean reading experience and focus on the content instead of being distracted with annoying ads. Just get a quick free account (Facebook & Google login) and you’re good to go.\n\nGood for your career. \nGreat for your life. \nGive it a shot!\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://deepstash.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://deepstash.com/privacy-policy"

      "label": "Learn Croatian with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the Croatian language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core Croatian words, form sentences, learn to speak Croatian phrases and take part in conversations. Fun Croatian lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule? The app works great and dynamically adjusts to your needs.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own Croatian language tutor in your pocket.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the Croatian language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Croatian grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right Croatian pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Croatian. Mondly teaches you Croatian vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational Croatian. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Croatian vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Croatian clearly.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Croatian verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• Advanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these Croatian lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com"

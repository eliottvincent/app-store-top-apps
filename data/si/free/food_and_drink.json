I love to replace „bad“ ingredients of classic recipes - for example cane sugar or white flour - with more healthy alternatives. Therefore we can still eat dessert.

I know, it’s not possible to spend hours in the kitchen every day. Most recipes are therefore quick, easy & ideal for take-away.\n4. All recipes are perfect for a fit lifestyle. Huge amounts of fats or sugar (alternatives) are therefore not part of the Pam app. It’s my job to have a flat tummy & toned thighs.. and that’s not even that hard!\n5. Take responsibility! If you want to feel amazing, you have to know about what you eat, the quality of the ingredients and how your dish was prepared. You should not give the responsibility about your health to somebody else.

No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends\n\nWhy purchase new ingredients when you can focus on what you already have?\n\nHere’s how it works:\n• For Supercook to do its magic, it needs to know all the ingredients you have at home.\n• Visit the pantry page in the SuperCook app and choose from a list of 2000+ ingredients broken down into categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, and many more. \n• Start adding ALL the ingredients you have at home to your SuperCook pantry – including oils, spices, and yes - even that old bottle of Worcestershire sauce in the back of the fridge!\n• Sit back and watch SuperCook work its magic by finding recipes that match your ingredients.\n\nSuperCook’s Unique App Features:\n \n--Customized Recipe Ideas--\nWe’ve consolidated over 11 million recipes from 18,000 recipe websites, in 20 languages to create the largest recipe collection ever.   This knowledge was fed into an AI system that learnt the intricacies of all ingredients and how they can be mixed together.\n\nAll you have to do is build your pantry on the app – and you’re ready to make delicious meals without ever leaving your house!\n\nSuperCook will find you any recipe you need, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a midnight snack.  \n\n--Easily Add Your Ingredients--\nSave time and money with an intelligent pantry. SuperCook’s voice dictation mode allows you to quickly add ingredients to your in-app pantry by simply saying them out loud.\n\nJust open your fridge, click the microphone button, and start listing everything inside. The app will automatically add the ingredients to your pantry for a quick and easy way to find recipes!\n \n--Automatic Recipe Recommendations--\nThe app will automatically find you recipes to make with what’s in your fridge – so all those lost ingredients in the back of your cupboard now have a place on your table.  It’s that simple!\n\nWhen you run out of an ingredient, simply open the SuperCook app and remove it from your pantry -  and all the recipe ideas will adjust accordingly.\n \n--Get Creative in the Kitchen--\nSuperCook inspires new ideas and activities in the kitchen for new cooks, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike.\n\nWith over 11 million recipes available in 20 different languages, SuperCook promises that you’ll never cook the same thing twice (unless you want to, of course!).\n\n--What's on the menu ?--\nThe menu page is where you'll find all your recipe ideas.  Why is it called menu?  Because just like the menu in a restaurant, everything on the menu page is available to you now.  SuperCook instantly analyzes 11 million recipes and finds the ones that match your unique ingredients.\n\nMost likely your menu page will contain thousands of recipes, but don't worry, we've broken them down into helpful categories like soups and stews, appetizers and snacks, salads, entrees, desserts and more.\n\n--Reduce food waste--\nMost people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. SuperCook is one of the best ways to reduce food waste in the home.   It finds recipes that use as many of your ingredients as possible, so nothing goes to waste.    SuperCook makes food waste prevention fun and easy, just open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe.   We help you use what you have, so nothing goes to waste!"

Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com.

You can also buy by boxes in our Farmers Market.\r\n\r\n- We are not an online supermarket\r\nWe don't resell food: our added-value lies in building a platform which provides logistics and customer service, so that our Farmers can sell their crops directly to you.\r\n\r\n- Win-Win-Winner\r\nOur economic model is based on a formula that we've dubbed \"Win-Win-Winner\": it's good for the Farmer, it's good for society, and together we can improve the environment.  \r\n\r\n- Lovers of ugly fruit and haters of waste\r\nCrowdFarming fights against food waste at the source thanks to adoptions. When you adopt something, you allow the Farmer to grow a crop knowing that someone will consume it. Moreover, the Farmers at CrowdFarming don't throw away \"ugly fruit\", as they abide to product-quality criteria instead of aesthetic-ones.\r\n\r\n- Open-minded, socially responsible\r\nAs food-consumers, we ask ourselves questions beyond the taste of food: do we only want organic-certified products available for purchase? What is more environment-friendly: a can or a glass bottle? How much water is needed to produce certain foods? We like undertaking these decisions with an open mind, and while being true to our values.\r\n\r\n- Multi-local mindset versus globalisation\r\nWe support an inclusive culture that favours social and cultural exchanges, seeking not to impose global, but multi-local solutions. Buy at the source to enjoy at the destination."

      "label": "\"I tried a handful of fasting apps for my intermittent fasting life and none of them was the right one for me. I then tried this one and it’s been the one I have stuck with. It’s simple yet complex in a good way. Great app. Recommended!\"\n\"MyFast is the best intermittent fasting tracker and weekly scheduler app available. It quickly guides you through the overall concept of fasting and will help you completely manage your fasting and eating windows. With over 200,000+ fast trackers, we are the most complete and trusted IF timer.\"\n\"Favorite app for tracking fasting / weight loss. I’m terrible at counting time and that’s the whole reason I have this app. I can set my goal by deciding I want to do an 18 hr fast and it tells me when to stop fasting. I can edit my goals on a daily basis when starting IF, OR set up a regular schedule. You can track water intake and weight loss and easily compare weight loss to fasting length on the same screen. Minimal, noninvasive ads and no required ‘plans’. I recommend this to everyone!”\nFeatures:\nSchedule out all your zero calorie fast and eating windows for the week and let the app timer run automatically with notifications telling you when to stop eating and when to start fasting.\nManual Mode: Choose a zero calorie fasting or eating window. Start and stop when you want. Edit all times, dates, goal length in real times.\nToday Widget\nEasily add, edit, delete, and .CSV export your completed fasts and body measurements like weight.\nVisualize and track your weight loss progress in the charts section.\nClock Format: Choose between 12 and 24 clock type and several different time display formats\nDate Format: Choose from several different local date formats to display throughout\nNotifications: Get notification reminders to fast every day, alerts for when your window is almost finished, and when it has completed.\nSimple, Clean, Minimalist, Clutter-Free Home Screen Timer\nUnlimited Fast Lengths\nMultiple Devices - Use your synced MyFast account on any device and never lose your data to an accident.\nExtra Tracking: Record water intake and other notes during your fast\nEnglish, Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese language options\nLearn Section – intermittent fasting book for beginners with all you need to know to become an IF expert\nWhat Is Intermittent Fasting?\nWhat usually comes to mind when most people hear of Intermittent Fasting (IF), is that it is just another crazy fad diet to lose weight with little effort. However, it isn't a diet at all, but rather an eating pattern. It’s not what you eat, but when you eat it that is important.\nDepending on what type of fasting you schedule, you generally will have a time window where you are allowed to eat all the food you want. As soon as that window is over though, you don't eat ANYTHING until the window comes up again. For example, a common approach is 16 hour fasts with an 8 hour eating window every day.\nThere are dozens of different type of fasting diets, and with MyFast you can utilize any plan such as:\n16/8 - Lean Gains\n5:2 - Eat normal for 5 days, and IF the remaining 2\n20/4 – The Warriot Diet\n24/0 – Full Day or Alternative Day Diet\nAlternative Day Diet - (every other day you will be fasting for 24 hours.)\nAny other zero calorie fasting plan you can think of is possible\nMyFast can be used free of charge, and within the app, you can choose to buy a subscription. With Subscription you can all premium features. Subscription renews automatically and charges to your iTunes Account. Subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of a period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of a period. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings after purchase.\nTerms of Services: https://myfasttracker.com/terms-and-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://myfasttracker.com/page-privacy"

Download Gluten Free Scanner now! \n\n\nHow to use Gluten Free Scanner?\n\n- Download the app\n- Enable access to your camera\n- Scan a barcode\n- Find out within seconds if the food product is gluten free\n\n\nWhat is a gluten free diet?\n\nA gluten free diet is an eating plan that excludes foods containing gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and triticale (a cross between wheat and rye). A gluten free diet is essential for managing signs and symptoms of Coeliac disease (also known as celiac disease) and other medical conditions associated with gluten. A gluten free diet is also popular among people who haven't been diagnosed with a gluten related medical condition. The claimed benefits of the diet are improved health, weight loss and increased energy\n\n\nWhat is coeliac disease?\n\nCoeliac disease is a condition where your immune system attacks your own tissues when you eat gluten. This damages your gut (small intestine) so you are unable to take in nutrients. Coeliac disease can cause a range of symptoms, including diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating. Coeliac disease is caused by an adverse reaction to gluten, which is a dietary protein found in 3 types of cereal:\n\n- wheat\n- barley\n- rye\n\nGluten is found in any food that contains those cereals, including:\n\n- pasta\n- cakes\n- breakfast cereals\n- most types of bread\n- certain types of sauces\n- some ready meals\n- In addition, most beers are made from barley.\n\n\nWhat causes coeliac disease?\n\nCoeliac disease is an autoimmune condition. This is where the immune system (the body's defence against infection) mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In coeliac disease, the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them. This damages the surface of the small bowel (intestines), disrupting the body's ability to take in nutrients from food. It's not entirely clear what causes the immune system to act this way, but a combination of genetics and the environment appear to play a part.\n\nTreating coeliac disease\n\nThere's no cure for coeliac disease, but following a gluten free diet should help control symptoms and prevent the long-term complications of the condition. Even if you have mild symptoms, changing your diet is still recommended because continuing to eat gluten can lead to serious complications. This may also be the case if tests show that you have some degree of coeliac disease even if you do not have noticeable symptoms. It's important to ensure that your gluten free diet is healthy and balanced. An increase in the range of available gluten free foods in recent years has made it possible to eat both a healthy and varied gluten-free diet."

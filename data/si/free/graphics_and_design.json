      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

It’s so much easier to edit your home screen with so many ideas. I wish they could add widgets that come with it. I told all my friends to get it it’s soooo good. Overall it’s the best app i’ve found so far to make your home screen aesthetic.\n\n\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nPREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION (weekly or annual subscription):\n- Get access to all the features\n- Get premium content updates\n- No ads\n\n\n\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- The account​ will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nYou can read our Privacy policy and Terms of Use at https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/50448913 https://www.iubenda.com/terms-and-conditions/50448913"

      "label": "Qlone is an all-in-one 3D scanner app. We have made it easy and fast to create 3D models from real objects, edit them with built-in editing tools and seamlessly export the result to popular platforms, 3D file formats and 3D printers. You can even animate your models in Augmented Reality! A perfect tool for AR/VR content creation, 3D Printing, STEM Education, eCommerce showcase and many other uses.\n \nSCANNING\nIf you choose to scan with the Qlone mat, simply print it from the included mat file, place your object in the middle of the mat and let the AR dome guide you through the scanning process. You can also scan the object from two different angles and it will be automatically merged for a better overall result which includes areas such as the bottom of the object.\nYou can now also scan without a mat in two different modes - AR mode which makes it easy to scan with our familiar AR dome or Photo mode, which takes higher quality 4K images in both manual or automatic modes.\n \nWhen scanning with the mat, there is no waiting time, all processing is done in real time on your phone in seconds. In the new option to scan without a mat, processing is done in minutes on our blazing fast Qlone Cloud but we value your privacy so we don't store or view any of your models!\n\nMODIFYING\nWith the integrated tools in the app you can optimize and modify your 3D model without needing to export them to other sophisticated software.\n \nTexture - Change the Brightness, Saturation and Sharpness of the 3D model. Pick colors from the scanned object and apply them by painting directly on the 3D model. Blur areas or transitions for smoother results.\nClean - Fill holes in the model, erase unwanted areas such as the background surface or smooth certain parts. \nSculpt - Improve or alter the shape of your object by pressing or pulling a selected area and adjust the transition.\nShape - Fix the orientation, enhance the mesh details or set the scale size of your model for 3D printing. You can also simplify the mesh for lower file size export.\nArt - Turn your object into scaled cubes or meshed objects of art, ready to be printed.\n\nAR View + ANIMATION:\nYou can beam your 3D models back to reality and bring them to life with automatic rigging and animation.\n \nEXPORTING and IMPORTING:\nExport your model directly to platforms like SketchFab, i.materialise, Lens Studio, Shapeways and CGTrader. Models can be exported in a variety of formats for use in other 3D tools – OBJ, STL, FBX, USDZ, GLB (Binary glTF) which includes animation, PLY, X3D. \n\nShare your models with friends as an image, video or GIF through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Email and iMessage.\n\nYou can import any 3D model into Qlone. Import in any 3D format (40+ formats) to view, modify or bring it to life in AR with our automatic animation!\n\nPREMIUM UPGRADE (ONE-TIME PURCHASE):\nQlone is free to download and scan but exporting the 3D models, AR view with Animations and scanning in 4K resolution are premium features that require an upgrade to premium. Such upgrade is a one-time purchase fee and is not based on an annoying subscription. \n\nAlso, there is a new premium feature that allows scanning without a mat! Since processing for scanning without the mat takes place on our Qlone Cloud, when you upgrade to premium you unlock this new option and receive 20 cloud credits for 20 such scans. You can later purchase more credits in highly affordable packs if needed.\n\nWhen you upgrade to premium, all models in your gallery and future models will be unlocked for unlimited exports in any format and it will work across all your Apple devices. \n\nPRIVACY POLICY:\nhttp://eyecue-tech.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=143\n\nTERMS OF USE:\nhttp://eyecue-tech.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=142"

This measuring method is already very precise and is constantly being further developed. However, this is also heavily dependent on the performance of the end device, the lighting conditions and the experience of the user. Measured values obtained from this procedure should also be checked with conventional measuring devices. Floor Plan AR is designed to help you quickly create 2D and 3D sketches.

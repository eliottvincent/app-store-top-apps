Capture and detect colors simply by pointing the camera at the object. The app identifies the color name and color code of the selected area on the screen.\n\n– Color Palette Generator. The application algorithm creates harmonious color palettes and you can adjust color values to your liking. Or you can generate a color palette that complements any color you input.\n\n– Color Harmonies. For each color you collect, the app creates color combinations that go well with a base color (based on color theory and color wheel harmonies). Grab a pre-defined color palette and adjust color values to your liking.\n \nAre you colorblind, unable to distinguish certain color hues, or simply want to know What color is it? It is a simple-to-use app for identifying colors for you!\n \nEasily save, share, duplicate, remove and edit already saved palettes. The app supports the most common color models as RGB, HEX, LAB, HSV, HSL, CMYK and color formats – .PNG, .SVG, .ACO, .ASE, .GPL.\n \nWhether you’re creating visual graphics, painting digitally, designing logos or interfaces, trying to match the brand color theme – being able to select the right color or palette quickly is important. Color Picker AR is a helpful all-in-one color tool for any artist that works with color palettes."

AI art can be generated by feeding data into a computer program that then creates an image based on that data. The results can be surprising and often beautiful.\n\nSome people believe that AI art is a new form of art that is not bound by the traditional rules of art. Others believe that AI art is simply a tool that can be used by artists to create new art.\n\nEither way, AI art is an exciting new development in the world of art.\n\n【 How to generate an AI image? 】\n\n• Describe what you want to generate, such as \"An astronaut riding a horse over the moon\" or \"A dolphin jumping a fishing boat on Christmas Day\".\n• Select an artistic style, from the best painters in history such as Dalí or Picasso to modern styles such as steampunk or synthwave.\n• Just click on create.\n\n----\n\nTerm of Use -  https://alejandro99aru.wixsite.com/misitio/terms-conditions\nPrivacy Policy - https://alejandro99aru.wixsite.com/misitio/privacy-policy\n\nNesAI offers a paid subscription for pro features\n\n----"

When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours before the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n\nThe user may manage subscriptions in the iTunes settings.

      "label": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\r\n\r\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

      "label": "Get to a healthier and more active life with Google Fit!\n\nIt’s hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress.

      "label": "Aplikacija je namenjena uporabi v Sloveniji.\n\nMobilna aplikacija #Ostani Zdrav je pripomoček, ki vam sporoči, če ste bili v stiku z okuženo osebo. Z njeno uporabo in upoštevanjem priporočil vsak izmed nas pripomore k obvladovanju širjenja virusa ter varovanju zdravja nas samih, naših bližnjih in celotne družbe.\n\nAplikacija #Ostani Zdrav pomaga pri zajezitvi in obvladovanju širjenja okužb z novim koronavirusom (SARS-CoV-2), zmanjšuje obremenjenost zdravstvenega sistema in s tem omogoča, da država z milejšimi ukrepi obvlada virus.\n\nAplikacija #Ostani Zdrav nas opozori, da smo bili v stiku z okuženo osebo, zato obstaja večje tveganje, da smo se okužili tudi sami. Tako že nemudoma po opozorilu, ki ga prejmemo od mobilne aplikacije, postanemo pri svojem ravnanju še bolj odgovorni: opazujemo svoje počutje in ob prvi zaznavi simptomov stopimo v stik z osebnim zdravnikom, se izogibamo nenujnim stikom z drugimi ljudmi, še posebej z ranljivimi posamezniki in še bolj dosledno izvajamo preventivne ukrepe (higiena rok in kašlja, nošenje mask in ustrezna medosebna razdalja).\n\nZ uporabo mobilne aplikacije ravnamo odgovorno do sebe in ostalih, hkrati pa pomagamo pri obvladovanju širjenja okužb s SARS-CoV-2. Aplikacija bo močno olajšala obveščanje tistih posameznikov, ki so bili v zadnjih 14 dnevih v stiku z okuženo osebo. Z epidemiološkim poizvedovanjem namreč ni mogoče identificirati, prepoznati vseh stikov, denimo vseh sopotnikov v javnem prevozu ali vseh obiskovalcev, ki bi se v gostinskem lokalu nahajali istočasno kot nekdo, ki je okužen s SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPROSTOVOLJNA IN BREZPLAČNA UPORABA\n\nAplikacijo #Ostani Zdrav si na svoj pametni mobilni telefon namestimo povsem prostovoljno in brezplačno. Po namestitvi bomo hitro in zanesljivo obveščeni o srečanjih z uporabniki aplikacije, pri katerih je bila potrjena okužba s SARS-CoV-2 in zato predstavljajo tveganje za morebitni prenos okužbe virusa tudi na nas. Aplikacija ne razkrije niti lokacije niti identitete okužene osebe, sporoči samo, da sta se dve osebi srečali. Funkcije aplikacije lahko kadar koli onemogočimo ali aplikacijo v celoti izbrišemo. S tem se bodo izbrisale tudi vse informacije, ki jih je aplikacija shranila.\nTudi tisti, ki je potrjeno okužen, to informacijo povsem prostovoljno deli z ostalimi uporabniki (pridobi posebno desetmestno kodo, ki jo nato sam vnese v aplikacijo). S tem podkrepi svojo odgovorno ravnanje.\n\nUČINKOVITOST APLIKACIJE\n\nAplikacija #Ostani Zdrav bo svoj namen dosegla, če si jo na mobilni telefon namestimo še preden zbolimo. Samo tako bodo osebe, s katerimi smo imeli stike preden smo izvedeli za okužbo, obveščene in bodo lahko pravočasno ravnale samozaščitno.\n\nAplikacijo #Ostani Zdrav sta pripravila Nacionalni inštitut za javno zdravje (NIJZ) in Ministrstvo za javno upravo (MJU), pri čemer NIJZ skrbi za vsebinski del aplikacije, MJU pa za tehničnega. Oba sta tako skupna upravljavca podatkov, ki se obdelujejo v okviru aplikacije #Ostani Zdrav."

V okviru pestre in uravnotežene prehrane je treba telesu zagotoviti ustrezno količino hranil.

      "label": "'Methylisothiazolinone' but what is that ?\n\nSavonnette is still not installed on your phone? QUICK QUICK QUICK ! Savonnette is there to help you understand your consumption of cosmetic products and offer you better and cleaner products for your body health and our planet's health thanks to a scan, statistics and a virtual beauty box.\n\n\nDo you want to know more about Savonnette? Here are some of the features of the application:\n\n- Your closet: If you want to understand the products composition that compose your bathroom cupboards, you just have to scan them and then save them in your closet. You can do as many as you want! This will then allow you to have statistics in order to know your consumption of harmful ingredients, follow your progress more easily and tend towards a cleaner, greener consumption, for your body heath and for our planet\n\n- A virtual beauty box: You will regularly discover, in this box, cosmetics from responsible brands that offer cleaner products that are better for your body health and for our planet. All the compositions are decrypted even in this box\n\n- A scanner to allow you to scan your cosmetic products in order to know everything about them, to know their origin: The composition, the dangerousness of the ingredients for your body health and for our planet, their origin, their function, their frequency of use. I'm also trying to teach you a little more about the composition to know how to decrypt them more easily, to act cleaner. And if you don't have the product to scan it, you can always search manually and have access to its composition.\n\n- A history: You will find there all the scans that you have done or the products that you have consulted. If you have a crush on a cleaner product just add it to favorites.\n\n- Access to all features anonymously: No account needed! And thanks to a QRcode you will always have access to your favorite products, your history, your box, your closets.\n\nAt Savonnette we want to support you towards more responsible consumption: consumption that allows you to pay attention to the health of your body but also to the health of the planet. Let me explain: In a world where we swim in information flows, where time is precious and where our body health and our planet health are most important, we want, thanks to all this information, to propose the most suitable and appropriate cosmetic products.\n\nSo do you want to participate in your well-being ?

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

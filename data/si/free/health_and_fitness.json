      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Težji program vsebuje 27 treningov, lažji pa 19. Treningi so zelo raznoliki, saj smo želeli ponuditi širok spekter različnih vadb. Paket vam ostane na voljo, dokler ste subscribani na aplikacijo.\nNovi paketi treningov bodo na leto prihajali maksimalno vsakih 6 mesecev.\n\nPODCAST\nS podcastom, ki ga dobite že s subscribom (4.99 EUR/mesec), smo želeli dvigniti motivacijo na drug nivo. Zavedamo se, kljub temu, da samo v motivacijo ne verjamemo, ampak je ravno ta v začetkih odločilna pri vztrajanju. Rdeča nit aplikacije je, da vam najprej predstavimo nekaj dejstev, zakaj vztrajati, kako, ter zakaj imamo v sebi vse kar potrebujemo ne samo za začetek miganja, ampak za dejansko lepše, bolj polno življenje. Morda se res sliši kot kliše, vendar resnično verjamemo, da se nam s pogledom nase, spremeni svet okrog nas. \n\nRECEPTI \nV rubriki “recepti” vas čakajo novi okusni obroki, pod razdelki zajtrki, malice, kosila, večerje in sladice. Nekateri so enostavni, nekateri manj. Verjamemo, da bo vsak zase našel popolnega. Vsebujejo tudi vegi predloge.\n\nLahko bi še naštevali, ampak s free trialom lahko vidite več. Ne odlašaj! Prijavi se zdaj. \n\nPogoji uporabe: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations not only do they help make major shifts in your mindset they also serve as prompts and daily reminders on what you are truly capable of, making sure you have an amazing day, everyday.\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your unconscious mind and your conscious mind.\nThe more you strengthen this connection the more resilient you will be when difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe.\n\nAnd the best way strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\nThere are so many benefits of using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words making it easier to recognize the negative + self-doubt thought patterns holding you back. \n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n\nTo have access to the \"I am Premium\" content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\r\n\r\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

V okviru pestre in uravnotežene prehrane je treba telesu zagotoviti ustrezno količino hranil. Priporočeno je omejevanje količine zaužitega sladkorja, soli in skupnih ter nasičenih maščob, zato aplikacija njihovo količino prikazuje v barvah semaforja. Nižje vrednosti so obarvane zeleno, visoke pa rdeče. Pri zadnjih bodite še posebej pozorni, da takšnih živil ne zaužijete preveč ali prepogosto. Da boste med živili lažje izbirali in izbrali, lahko z aplikacijo preprosto primerjate njihovo hranilno sestavo.

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "A professional and indispensable toolset for modern day physical therapists. The app helps you:\n  - Increase efficiency,\n  - Simplify everyday tasks,\n  - Perform a variety of assessments,\n  - Impress and attract more patients,\n  - Explain diagnosis to patients,\n  - Build patients' confidence and trust.\n\nEasy to use and provides valuable information to both, practitioners and patients. The app includes:\n- Posture analysis\n- Functional Movement Screen (FMS) analysis\n- Simple and precise Range of Motion (ROM) measurement\n- Angles and ROM measurements on images\n- Motion analysis (angles, velocities, accelerations)\n- 10 meter walk test (or any other distance)\n- 6 minute walk test (or any other duration)\n\nPOSTURE ANALYSIS\nFast, easy and intuitive. Find imbalances and asymmetries. Analyze whole body posterior, anterior and lateral postures, or examine in greater detail specific points of interest - analyze head and neck in front and lateral views, analyze condition of patients with facial paralysis or look for trunk asymmetries indicating a scoliosis.\n\nRANGE OF MOTION\nState of the art goniometer for smart devices. Leave cumbersome goniometers in a drawer and use your device to measure ROMs. Unlike traditional goniometers and other apps, there is no need for perfect alignment - just place the device in a most convenient way you can, let a patient make a movement, read the results and compare them to reference values.\n\nMEASURE ANGLES ON IMAGES\nTake a picture of a patient or select an image from gallery, and measure ROM or any other angles directly on the image. Show the measurements to the patient to allow him to comprehend his condition better by inspecting visual evidence.\n\nFMS ANALYZER\nSome movement compensations can be missed even by an experienced therapist. Also, it is not always easy to explain to a patient the magnitude of spotted problems. Our FMS analyzer can provide you with objective measures of the correctness of the performed movement and any imbalances you might have spotted or even missed. Visualized results are appreciated by both, therapists and patients.\n\n6 MINUTE WALK TEST\nEnter a walkway length, tap 'Start', place the device in a patient's front pocket and come back in 6 minutes (or any other duration you set) for results. The app will calculate the walked distance, inform the patient when the time is out and allow you to enter parameters, such as blood pressure, BORG index, etc.\n\n10 METER WALK TEST\nPerform 10m walk test, or set the distance to any other arbitrary length. Perform multiple trials (if needed) of normal-comfortable speed and maximum speed walks. The app will calculate velocities for each trial as well as average of all trials and generate a report.\n\nMOTION ANALYSIS\nUse the device as a sensor to capture and analyze motions of interest - arm swings, trunk movements, weight lifting, squatting, ... The movement is charted in terms of angles, angular velocities and accelerations and linear velocities and accelerations. Use it in therapy, use it when working with sportsman, use it wherever you find it useful!\n\nHelp us get even better!\nYour opinion is very important to us so, please, feel to tell us what you think, what you like and what you don't like and what features you would like to see in the app: support@trinuslab.com\n\nFantastic app, but is it free?\nHuge resources were needed (and still are) to develop and support such an app so, unfortunately, we cannot give it for free. However, even for the smallest of therapist's practices the cost is negligible and benefits are countless. Your small support will enable us to continually improve the app!"

Težji program vsebuje 27 treningov, lažji pa 19. Treningi so zelo raznoliki, saj smo želeli ponuditi širok spekter različnih vadb. Paket vam ostane na voljo, dokler ste subscribani na aplikacijo.\nNovi paketi treningov bodo na leto prihajali maksimalno vsakih 6 mesecev.\n\nPODCAST\nS podcastom, ki ga dobite že s subscribom (4.99 EUR/mesec), smo želeli dvigniti motivacijo na drug nivo. Zavedamo se, kljub temu, da samo v motivacijo ne verjamemo, ampak je ravno ta v začetkih odločilna pri vztrajanju. Rdeča nit aplikacije je, da vam najprej predstavimo nekaj dejstev, zakaj vztrajati, kako, ter zakaj imamo v sebi vse kar potrebujemo ne samo za začetek miganja, ampak za dejansko lepše, bolj polno življenje. Morda se res sliši kot kliše, vendar resnično verjamemo, da se nam s pogledom nase, spremeni svet okrog nas. \n\nRECEPTI \nV rubriki “recepti” vas čakajo novi okusni obroki, pod razdelki zajtrki, malice, kosila, večerje in sladice. Nekateri so enostavni, nekateri manj. Verjamemo, da bo vsak zase našel popolnega. Vsebujejo tudi vegi predloge.\n\nLahko bi še naštevali, ampak s free trialom lahko vidite več. Ne odlašaj!

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Powered by nature and innovative technology that personalizes your daily experience while keeping you in control of your cycle data.\n\n\nPainful Periods Aren't Natural\n\n\nBut they are common.

Each phase brings changes to the brain and body. Exercising and eating based on your cycle means changing the types of movements and nutrients during each phase to optimize your physique, hormones, and mood. 28 empowers you with simplified science, breathtaking content, and cutting-edge technology. \n\nBecome the Expert of You\n\n\nYou are a mystery.

We're proud to have one of the strongest privacy policies in all of tech, which includes a steadfast commitment to never sell user cycle data to anyone for any reason and to never turn over user cycle data to any government or regulatory authority under any circumstance. We've intentionally built our algorithm to be manually controlled by the user at any time, as opposed to leveraging more invasive, machine learning methods. The only cycle data we currently collect is provided voluntarily by the user. It is also never shared with any existing or future investors. It is strictly confidential and used only for the purposes of providing a customized user experience. Any cycle data the user provides now or in the future can be changed or deleted by the user at any time. We do not store deleted cycle data. Once the user deletes that information, it is gone forever.\n\nEmbrace your nature and begin today!"

Benefit from the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method, trusted by hundreds of millions adopters worldwide!\n\nPerfect for establishing a basic eating discipline, Simple is ideal for keeping yourself in good shape during self-isolation, with our educational and motivational content on staying mindful about your eating habits.\n\nPopularized by celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé, intermittent fasting is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans. It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

These plans were designed to ensure you cook for 25 minutes or less each day to help you slot these meals into your everyday routine. \n\nAll the macronutrients are broken down to help you understand what you are nourishing your body with. \n\nThe meal plans and recipes include my go-to banana pancakes, quesadillas with a protein of your choice, my cherry-chocolate milkshake and so much more! \n\nThis meal plan is there to support you to make better food choices, NOT to restrict you from your favorite foods. The meals are adjustable, delicious and full of goodness, helping you fuel your amazing body!\n\nSign up today and come Grow With Jo :) \n\nGrow with Jo works with Apple Health to record your calories burned after workout.\n\nGrow with Jo is following well known worldwide health publications rules to propose you healthy diet plan. More info about diet guidelines you can find at our website: https://app.growwithjo.app/info\n\nPayments for access to the application will be auto-renewed if it is not turned off at least 24 hours before the current period. The account will be debited at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Users can manage subscriptions and disable auto-renewal in the app’s settings.\n\nGrow with Jo is providing diet plans which cannot be taken as a medical diagnosis. If you wish to get a medical diagnosis, please contact with your nearest medical center.\n\nTerms of service: https://app.growwithjo.app/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://app.growwithjo.app/privacy-policy"

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps.

Tell us your diet goals, the foods you like, your budget, and what your schedule looks like, and we'll automatically generate a complete meal plan to meet your targets. It's like having a personal diet assistant.\n\nWe offer both free accounts and premium accounts. As a free user, you can create a day's meal plan and completely customize it however you want. Each meal can have different preferences, and your nutrition targets can be whatever you like.\n\nAs a premium user, we'll automatically generate a week of meal plans and send them to you with a grocery list via email. As you follow the plans, you can track what you did or didn't eat, and if you deviate from the plans, we make it easy to readjust your targets for the next week to stay on track. Try out the free account to see if our meal plans appeal to you, and upgrade when you're ready.\n\n- Follow any eating style or create your own (works for keto, paleo, vegetarian, vegan, and more)\n- Hit your macros and calorie targets every day\n- Empower yourself with automatic control over your diet\n- Take the anxiety out of picking what to eat\n- Personalize any of our recipes and they'll replace the original\n- Reduce food waste\n- Don't like our suggestions? Easily swap them out or configure the generator to only use foods you like\n- Manage your virtual pantry (with a premium account)\n\nNormal calorie trackers force you to add foods into your diary one by one. And by the end of the day, there's no guarantee that you'll be anywhere near the nutrition targets you're trying to reach. With our automatic planner, there's nothing to track because everything is already entered for you, and all you have to do is follow the plan.\n\n\nSubscription options:\n- You can download the app for free and create/customize as many unique meal plans as you want, and save one to your account.\n- To unlock the features of Eat This Much Premium, you can subscribe for either the monthly or yearly description.\n\nAuto-renew details:\n- The price to subscribe in your currency will be shown in the app before confirming the subscription.\n- After the free trial has ended, payment will be charged to your iTunes Account.\n- Your subscription will auto-renew unless cancelled 24 hours before the end of the current period (the auto-renew will continue with the same frequency that you select, either the monthly price for the  monthly subscription or yearly price for the yearly subscription).\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the same price you initially paid.\n- Auto-renew can be turned off at any time from your iTunes Account Settings.\n- If you cancel your subscription or turn off auto renew in the middle of a billing cycle your account will remain premium until the end of that cycle.\n\nApple health integration:\nApple health syncing can be enabled in Settings -> Apple Health -> Enable Apple Health syncing for Premium users.\n\nWhen Apple Health is enabled:\n- your weight will automatically import and export when you login and when you view your user profile\n- nutrition information will automatically export for meals marked \"I ate this\" when they are first viewed in the app and as you edit them\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.eatthismuch.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of use: https://www.eatthismuch.com/terms/"

      "label": "NC° Birth Control · NC° Plan Pregnancy\n\n○ The #1 Rated Birth Control & Ovulation Temperature Tracker App in the US & UK\n○ Subscription-based to protect your data. We will never sell your personal data.\n○ The only birth control app cleared by the FDA and CE marked as a medical device\n○ Adaptive tracker technology that uses your unique cycle and basal temperature to track ovulation so you know exactly when you're fertile, and what days you can and cannot get pregnant\n○ Daily insights into your fertility and personal ovulatory pattern to help with your birth control or natural family planning needs\n○ Scientifically proven to be effective: 93% effective with typical use, and 98% effective with perfect use\n○ Switch modes and use to plan a pregnancy. Great for couples to follow ovulation and trying to conceive \n\nNatural Cycles is not just a period or basal body temperature tracker. Most other fertility tracking apps assume your cycle is 28 days long. This means the fertile window they give you is not tailored to you. Our algorithm significantly reduces the risk of you being assigned an incorrect fertile day as it uses your personal data. This reduces the risk of unwanted pregnancy, or can help you plan pregnancy and conceive with greater precision. \n\nBIRTH CONTROL, FERTILITY & OVULATION TRACKING PRICING PLANS \n○ Yearly Plan (Recommended): $99.99/year.\n○ Monthly Plan: $12.99/month.\n○ A subscription is needed to use the сycle tracker, and while a free demo is available, we recommend a minimum of 2-3 cycles for Natural Cycles to be most effective.\n○ We charge a subscription in order to protect you and your data. Free apps need to make money, so many of them do so by sharing or selling their users’ data to third parties for advertising. We will never sell your data because our users' privacy is paramount to us.\n\nPRECAUTIONS\n○ Natural Cycles fertility tracker does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Use a condom to protect against STIs.\n○ No method of birth control is 100% effective, even when using the birth control app perfectly you can still get pregnant.\n○ Natural Cycles is for women over the age of 18.\n○ Natural Cycles is only available as a method of birth control in the US and in Europe.\n○ To use Natural Cycles, you need to understand English or one of the supported languages.\n\nNatural Cycles is not just a period and ovulation tracker app, but your fertility partner that can meet your needs, at any cycle or life stage. Still not sure? Download the app and test out our Demo Mode. The app supports syncing with Apple Health. \n\n*E.

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

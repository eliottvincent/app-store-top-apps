In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

Težji program vsebuje 27 treningov, lažji pa 19. Treningi so zelo raznoliki, saj smo želeli ponuditi širok spekter različnih vadb. Paket vam ostane na voljo, dokler ste subscribani na aplikacijo.\nNovi paketi treningov bodo na leto prihajali maksimalno vsakih 6 mesecev.\n\nPODCAST\nS podcastom, ki ga dobite že s subscribom (4.99 EUR/mesec), smo želeli dvigniti motivacijo na drug nivo. Zavedamo se, kljub temu, da samo v motivacijo ne verjamemo, ampak je ravno ta v začetkih odločilna pri vztrajanju. Rdeča nit aplikacije je, da vam najprej predstavimo nekaj dejstev, zakaj vztrajati, kako, ter zakaj imamo v sebi vse kar potrebujemo ne samo za začetek miganja, ampak za dejansko lepše, bolj polno življenje. Morda se res sliši kot kliše, vendar resnično verjamemo, da se nam s pogledom nase, spremeni svet okrog nas. \n\nRECEPTI \nV rubriki “recepti” vas čakajo novi okusni obroki, pod razdelki zajtrki, malice, kosila, večerje in sladice. Nekateri so enostavni, nekateri manj. Verjamemo, da bo vsak zase našel popolnega. Vsebujejo tudi vegi predloge.\n\nLahko bi še naštevali, ampak s free trialom lahko vidite več. Ne odlašaj!

      "label": "Aplikacija je namenjena uporabi v Sloveniji.\n\nMobilna aplikacija #Ostani Zdrav je pripomoček, ki vam sporoči, če ste bili v stiku z okuženo osebo. Z njeno uporabo in upoštevanjem priporočil vsak izmed nas pripomore k obvladovanju širjenja virusa ter varovanju zdravja nas samih, naših bližnjih in celotne družbe.\n\nAplikacija #Ostani Zdrav pomaga pri zajezitvi in obvladovanju širjenja okužb z novim koronavirusom (SARS-CoV-2), zmanjšuje obremenjenost zdravstvenega sistema in s tem omogoča, da država z milejšimi ukrepi obvlada virus.\n\nAplikacija #Ostani Zdrav nas opozori, da smo bili v stiku z okuženo osebo, zato obstaja večje tveganje, da smo se okužili tudi sami. Tako že nemudoma po opozorilu, ki ga prejmemo od mobilne aplikacije, postanemo pri svojem ravnanju še bolj odgovorni: opazujemo svoje počutje in ob prvi zaznavi simptomov stopimo v stik z osebnim zdravnikom, se izogibamo nenujnim stikom z drugimi ljudmi, še posebej z ranljivimi posamezniki in še bolj dosledno izvajamo preventivne ukrepe (higiena rok in kašlja, nošenje mask in ustrezna medosebna razdalja).\n\nZ uporabo mobilne aplikacije ravnamo odgovorno do sebe in ostalih, hkrati pa pomagamo pri obvladovanju širjenja okužb s SARS-CoV-2. Aplikacija bo močno olajšala obveščanje tistih posameznikov, ki so bili v zadnjih 14 dnevih v stiku z okuženo osebo. Z epidemiološkim poizvedovanjem namreč ni mogoče identificirati, prepoznati vseh stikov, denimo vseh sopotnikov v javnem prevozu ali vseh obiskovalcev, ki bi se v gostinskem lokalu nahajali istočasno kot nekdo, ki je okužen s SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPROSTOVOLJNA IN BREZPLAČNA UPORABA\n\nAplikacijo #Ostani Zdrav si na svoj pametni mobilni telefon namestimo povsem prostovoljno in brezplačno. Po namestitvi bomo hitro in zanesljivo obveščeni o srečanjih z uporabniki aplikacije, pri katerih je bila potrjena okužba s SARS-CoV-2 in zato predstavljajo tveganje za morebitni prenos okužbe virusa tudi na nas. Aplikacija ne razkrije niti lokacije niti identitete okužene osebe, sporoči samo, da sta se dve osebi srečali. Funkcije aplikacije lahko kadar koli onemogočimo ali aplikacijo v celoti izbrišemo. S tem se bodo izbrisale tudi vse informacije, ki jih je aplikacija shranila.\nTudi tisti, ki je potrjeno okužen, to informacijo povsem prostovoljno deli z ostalimi uporabniki (pridobi posebno desetmestno kodo, ki jo nato sam vnese v aplikacijo). S tem podkrepi svojo odgovorno ravnanje.\n\nUČINKOVITOST APLIKACIJE\n\nAplikacija #Ostani Zdrav bo svoj namen dosegla, če si jo na mobilni telefon namestimo še preden zbolimo. Samo tako bodo osebe, s katerimi smo imeli stike preden smo izvedeli za okužbo, obveščene in bodo lahko pravočasno ravnale samozaščitno.\n\nAplikacijo #Ostani Zdrav sta pripravila Nacionalni inštitut za javno zdravje (NIJZ) in Ministrstvo za javno upravo (MJU), pri čemer NIJZ skrbi za vsebinski del aplikacije, MJU pa za tehničnega. Oba sta tako skupna upravljavca podatkov, ki se obdelujejo v okviru aplikacije #Ostani Zdrav."

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in.

We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.

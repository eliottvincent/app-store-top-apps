Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

Realizing that loving parents, if they wish, will be able to watch any chat.\nFriendly interface, high ease of use, ELARI online support via chat within the application or by phone - all this makes taking care of those you care about a simple task!\n\nBy connecting the ELARI Kid's watch-phone to the free ELARI SafeFamily application, you can:\n• Customize contact list on Kid’s watch\n• Track your child's location with the watch\n• Set the frequency of updating the geolocation\n• Remotely set alarms\n• Remotely receive a record of the situation around the watch\n• Set permitted geofences – a virtual area that is indicated around the child's usual locations: school, home and etc. If the child is outside the specified area, you will receive a notification\n• Invite family and friends to track the location of the child communicate with child\n• Receive SOS alerts from the watch in case of emergency: along with the alert, you'll receive your child's location, as well as an audio recording from the watch's microphone.\n\nThe ELARI SafeFamily application allows you to manage the KidGram messenger on flagship models of ELARI watches (and on any smartphone or tablet soon). All the functions are available to you in the free versions:\n• Be a friend and mentor to your child! The KidGram service will allow you to communicate with your child through your Telegram account and share good content with him, including links to groups, Telegram channels and specific YouTube videos.\n• Control children's communication and content. Through the ELARI SafeFamily application, you choose and always see the list of contacts, groups and channels to which the child has access, as well as message statistics for the period. Links to web pages will be inactive, so the child will not be able to go to a questionable site\n• Disable or allow searches for contacts and content. Through the ELARI SafeFamily application, you can enable or disable the search for new channels or contacts from the Telegram world. But even if the search is allowed, the child will not be able to add a new contact or watch / subscribe to the channel without your approval."

You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

If something bad happens, the system will instantly activate the sirens, notify of danger and call the security company patrol dispatch.\n\nIN THE APP:\n\n◦ Manage security modes and your smart home from anywhere in the world\n◦ Get alarm notifications\n◦ Monitor system events\n◦ View the photos taken with the detectors of the MotionCam lineup, and security camera footage\n◦ Set up devices, automation scenarios, and security schedules\n\n• • • \n\n“Intruder Alarm of the Year” — Security & Fire Excellence Awards, London\n“Security & Firefighting Risks” — silver medal at Expoprotection Awards, Paris\n“Intruder product of the year” — PSI Premier Awards 2020\n“Security System of the Year” — Ukrainian People Choice Award 2021\n\n1.5 million people in 130 countries are protected by Ajax.\n\n• • •\n\nAGAINST BURGLARS\nThe detectors instantly capture an intruder on your property, doors or windows opening, and glass breaking. As soon as a person enters a protected area, they will be captured by the photo camera of the MotionCam detector lineup. You and the security company will know what happened.\n\nONE CLICK AND HELP IS ON THE WAY\nPress the panic button on the app, key fob, or keyboard in an emergency. Ajax will call a security company patrol dispatch or medical help and notify all system users about the danger.\n\nDETECTING FIRE AND CARBON MONOXIDE\nFire detectors notify of smoke and temperature spike and promptly alert about a dangerous carbon monoxide (CO) concentration with no color, smell, or taste. The built-in sirens will wake up even those who are fast asleep.\n\nINFORMING ABOUT FLOODING\nThe detectors notify of a pipe break, a washing machine leak, or an overflowing bathtub. The system will inform users, while scenarios with relays automatically turn off the water. And if the upstairs neighbors flood your apartment, you will get the app notification. \n\nVIDEO CAMERA IN THE SMARTPHONE \nWatch video from security cameras directly in the app. Connecting the Dahua, Uniview, Hikvision, and Safire cameras and DVRs takes a minute. Equipment from other manufacturers is connected via an RTSP link.\n\nSMART HOME\nChange security modes up to a schedule, program the outdoor lighting to turn on when strangers are detected on your property, or implement an anti-flood system. Manage gates, electric locks, lighting, heating, and electrical appliances. In the app, automatically by scenario or by pressing a smart button.\n\nPROFESSIONAL LEVEL OF RELIABILITY\nThe hub runs on OS Malevich, protected from failures, viruses, and cyberattacks. Thanks to the backup battery and communication channels, the system is resistant to power outages or the lack of Internet connectivity. The account is protected by session control and two-factor authentication. Ajax has been rated Grade 2 by five independent labs.\n\nCONNECTING TO THE SECURITY COMPANY MONITORING STATION\n3,500 security companies in 130 countries work with the Ajax security systems.\n\n• • •\n\nAjax equipment is required to work with the app. You can buy the devices from authorized Ajax partners in your region.\n\nLearn more: www.ajax.systems\n\nHave any questions?

Ensure your child is where they’re supposed to be and that they aren’t visiting high-risk areas.\n\nLoud signal – send a loud notification to your child’s phone if they’re having difficulty locating it or if it was left on silent mode and they can't hear your call.\n\nScreen time – find out what apps they’re using in school and how long they’re using them. Now you can see what’s distracting them and prevents them from focusing in the classroom.\n\nSecurity control – check that your child arrived at school on time – get notifications when they reach school, return home and get to other places; add in custom locations for additional security.\n\nBattery check – track your child's mobile device charge status, remind your child to charge their phone in time with notifications to let you know that their battery is running low.\n\nFamily chat – chat with your child in our app with ease! Funny stickers are available for even more fun compared to standard messaging apps. \n\nHow Find My Kids works:\n1. Install ‘Find My Kids’ on your phone\n2.

Blur your pic, cover your face with emojis, add a mosaic effect… whatever! Get creative while protecting your privacy.\n\n* Hooking up with new people is even more fun, with Kasual Cards. Choose 1 of 4 default cards; flip it over; and hey! You’ve got a 50% chance of finding someone in your area. Ready for your next casual encounter?\n\n* You don’t need to pay to send a message — it's 100% free to chat with your mutual matches, and the people you see after you've flipped over their card.\n\n* Kasual is for everybody who is at least 18 years old. Straight, gay, lesbian, bi, trans, singles and couples, everyone is welcome with Kasual, and it all starts with a random flip.\n\nKasual is free to download, so get it now.

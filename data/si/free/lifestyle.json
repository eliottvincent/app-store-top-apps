And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries.

You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

Your favorite songs play on the speakers and you still haven't gotten out of bed. How lovely, right? Smart products like lighting, speakers, blinds and air purifiers can make a lovely addition to your everyday life. When you improve the IQ of your home, life itself runs a bit smoother.\r\n\r\nThe magic happens when you combine two or more smart products from IKEA, tell them what to do in the app and save it as a 'Scene'.\r\n\r\nA great scene is one you will use often. Think about waking up and going to bed, cooking and eating, date night and family time, or leaving and coming home. All everyday moments when we can support you with the best lighting, sound that suits your mood, and cleaner air.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone, from young to old and even visitors. So while the app gives you total control to customize your smart home, our range of remotes make it easy for everyone to live with and use a smart home.\r\n\r\nIn control \r\n• You can control products individually or in groups. You can turn whole rooms on and off or the whole home, all at once.\r\n• Dim and change light colours, adjust blinds, speaker volume, and much more.\r\n• Set the scenes you need and trigger them with schedules, a shortcut button or use the app.\r\n\r\nEasy to use\r\n• The home screen gives a fast overview of your whole home. Quickly control products, access rooms, or start/stop scenes. This is also where you add new products, rooms, and scenes. \r\n\r\nOrganized and personal\r\n• Organizing your smart products in rooms gives fast access to the products you want to control.\r\n• Personalize the app with your choice of icons, names and colours for rooms and products\r\n• Create personal scenes, for example your own combination of cosy lighting and your favorite music. \r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n• Connect to Apple Home, Amazon Alexa or Google Home to use a voice assistant."

Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control (iOS) \nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

With WAUDOG Smart ID, your pet will return home faster thanks to the link between the pet’s ID and profile within the global database of identified animals. Store your pet's documents in the application, mark vaccination dates, schedule grooming, and add medication regimens in the calendar.\n\nRegistration in the application is simple, fast, and free. \nIt includes a separate profile for the owner and for each animal; details can be added later.\n\nA lost pet will not be able to give its address and phone number or tell what food it is allergic to. All of this data can be obtained from the pet’s QR pet tag in the WAUDOG Smart ID database. Whoever finds the lost pet simply needs to scan the QR code on the tag to find out all the information about the animal and its owner's contact details. QR pet tag works all over the world.\n\nYou will receive a push notification and email when the pet tag is scanned. In the application, you will see data about the location where the scan occurred.\n\nThe pet's public profile contains the owner's contacts. The person who scanned the tag will be able to choose a way to quickly contact you.\nIn addition, the pet profile can be located through a microchip search.\n\nThe care diary is made for easy pet care. Create a diary for your pet, set up an event category, and always remember your important things.\n\nStore your pet's documents online. They will always be on hand when you need them."

      "label": "Headrix frames are 100% made in Germany. Our 3D printing process leaves no waste\r\n\nMeasure your face and the pupillary distance with our Face Metrix module. Choose Headrix glasses comfortably and without time pressure. All models, all color combinations, live on your face thanks to augmented reality. Pay attention to “Best Choice” instructions when trying on. Our algorithm makes suggestions based on your face shape and some other features. Share pictures and short videos with your friends. Make fun of this otherwise serious matter. The app will help you get the glasses you want. Out of the list with your favourite models you can prepare the data for the order and scan your face for future customization in just a few steps. Our team takes care of the appointment at the optician store. The Headrix app allows multiple accounts to be created, so that a suitable iPhone or iPad can help several people to get their Headrix frames. Everything is in your hands. There is no forwarding of the data to the optician without prior consultation with you.\r\n\r\nThe app consists of 3 modules:\r\n\n  1. Face Metrix: instant face measurement including pupillary distance.\r\n  2. Virtual try-on of the Headrix glasses\r\n  3. Reservation of the selected frame including 3D face scan.\r\nWith the Face Metrix function, your face is measured and the following values ​​are displayed immediately: far and near PD, face width, width of the nose bridge, nasal edge angles, face shape (oval, square, round or triangular).\r\n\nYou can switch between the live try-on and the try-on on a selfie video using the icon at the bottom left. Several 5-second videos can be recorded, both in the recommended mode and in free direction. No sound is recorded.\r\n\nThe camera symbol at the bottom right can be used to take photos (touch) and videos (press and hold). You can then save or share the resulting photo or video. Here the videos are recorded with sound.\r\n\nDuring try-on all models are automatically adjusted to the face size and therefore do not always correspond to the standard size. However, each model can later be produced individually.\r\n\nWhile trying on the glasses, you can add them to the watch list by clicking on the bookmark symbol in the top right corner.\r\n\nYou can find the watch list in the main menu under \"My Account\". The reservation can be made from the wish list. This process includes a facial scan and, optionally, scheduling at the optician's. Registration in the app is required for the reservation. There are no liabilities without prior contact from Headrix. The app measures dimensions of the face relevant to the individual glasses, including the pupillary distance. The app creates a schematic 3D model of the face.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\nMain functions:\r\n\n  - With Face Metrix you immediately get the relevant parameters of your face, including far and near PD\r\n  - Live virtual try-on\r\n  - Try-on with your selfie video, especially suitable for visually impaired users\r\n  - Record results and share them with your friends and loved ones\r\n  - Face scan for creating individualized glasses\r\n\r\nYou can use the app on these devices:\r\n\niPhone 12 Pro Max\r\niPhone 12 Pro\r\niPhone 12 mini\r\niPhone 12\r\niPhone 11 Pro Max\r\niPhone 11 Pro\r\niPhone 11\r\niPhone XS Max\r\niPhone XS\r\niPhone XR\r\niPhone X\r\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (4th generation)\r\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation)\r\niPad Pro 11-inch (2nd generation)\r\niPad Pro 11-inch"

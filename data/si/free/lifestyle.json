      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

      "label": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app.\n\nAlong with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.\n\nThrough our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.\n\n**The I Am Sober app features:**\n\n• Sober day tracker\nTo visualize how long you’ve been sober.\n\n• Remember why you quit\nAdd reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.\n\n• Daily pledge tracker\nTake a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "Your smartphone becomes the digital link to your Mercedes. You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

Receive an alarm when your baby cries, listen to the automated audio stream or look at live video footage. You can use the app when connected to Wi-Fi or with a 3G or LTE mobile connection. Luna consumes much less battery power and data than other baby monitor apps. Luna is consistently reliable, even when it's running in the background.\n\nRELIABLE, SIMPLE, SECURE\n\nBy using the latest technology, Luna offers maximum reliability and security. You'll never miss an alarm again.\n\nCLEVER DESIGN\n\nWe've invested a lot of time in creating a sophisticated and beautiful design. That is why Luna isn't just user-friendly, it's also nice to look at. Plus, while Luna is monitoring your baby, it displays all the important features.\n\nINTELLIGENT ECO MODE SAVES BATTERY LIFE AND DATA\n\nThanks to our unique Eco-Mode, the Luna app uses 4 times less battery power than any other baby monitoring app while also conserving your data usage.\n\nUNLIMITED COVERAGE\n\nWherever you are,. as long as you have an Internet connection, the Luna app consistently sends you alarms and live audio streams when your child wakes up.\n\nAUDIO AND VIDEO STREAMING\n\nYour Luna parent station automatically receives a live audio stream whenever there's noise in the children's room. Alternatively, you can check the app yourself at any time you like. The video stream will also be activated at any time - without any feedback.\n\nRUNS RELIABLY IN THE BACKGROUND\n\nLuna is a multitasker! As opposed to other baby monitor apps, Luna runs reliably without issues in the background. This frees you up to use your mobile device for other things when you need to.\n\nADJUSTABLE SENSITIVITY \n\nLuna will graphically display the background audio level of the last few minutes. The app will also help you to define the right alarm threshold.\n\nACTIVITY LOG\n\nLuna shows you how long your child has been sleeping and it provides you with a notification record.\n\nENCRYPTED DATA TRANSFER\n\nWe protect your privacy. All data transfers made by Luna are encrypted by SSL. This means that no one else will be able to access your data.\n\nINTELLIGENT CONNECTION MONITORING\n\nYou're on the road and the internet connection went down? Don't worry! Luna continuously monitors the connection between the baby station and the parent station and will notifiy you in case of any interruptions. Luna will also try to automatically restore the connection as quickly as possible.\n\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\n\nYou will need at least two iOS devices (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 2/iPad Mini or newer, iOS 9.3 or newer).\nMake sure that both devices are connected to the internet, and you're good to go!\n\nHONEST APPS, MADE IN GERMANY\n\nA baby monitor which does exactly what it says on the tin: A reliable notification whenever your child cries. \n\nWe're Uberblic Labs, a small development team based in Berlin. You might know our app, ParcelTrack, enjoyed by millions of users worldwide. We develop apps which meet their promises. We hope you like our new baby monitor.

Don’t let your past memories only live in the past…use them to your advantage to remember them, learn from them, and grow from them!\n\nAll you have to dedicate is 1 minute a day for your mental health, self-reflection, memory keepsakes, and personal growth. \nJust 1 minute a day for your life memories to stay. \n\nThe questions in Q365 will help you cultivate gratitude and mindfulness for the small and joyful things, for the major life milestones, for your strength in pushing through your problems, and much more. Let self-awareness and a trip down memory lane bring you happiness today.\n\nGratitude and mindfulness for all aspects of your life translate to a more confident and positive YOU; happier to notice the beautiful things in life, while also mentally stronger to deal with the challenges. \n\nLife moves too quickly sometimes for people to notice the change, let Q365 remind you of what you may have overlooked.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms and conditions: https://theq365.com/terms.html\nPrivacy policy: https://theq365.com/privacy.html"

SMART is an acronym that stands for “Specific”, “Measurable”, “Achievable”, “Relevant”, and “Time-Bound”.\n\nSpecific\nYour goals should be clear and specific to give you the idea of what you really want to accomplish.\n\nMeasurable\nThe ability to measure the success or failure of a goal makes it more tangible in nature. \n\nAchievable\nThis is an often overlooked aspect of goal setting - determining whether a particular goal is realistic and attainable. It’s not meant to be discouraging but preparing yourself for the ride.\n\nRelevant\nWhy is the goal relevant to you? How relevant is it compared to the other goals? It makes you think about the goal.\n\nYou and only you can decide the relevance of your goal and whether you or your team have the bandwidth to achieve it. You might think that it’s important, but you have to ask yourself – is it really necessary?\n\nTime-Bound\nA goal is a dream with a deadline. This is the most important aspect. Enhappy will help you reach your goals this year."

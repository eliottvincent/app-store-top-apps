The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\n\n\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals.

      "label": "The simplest program to track breastfeeding, pumping, bottle feeding, solid food consumption, diapers, sleep schedule, height and weight, and more.\n\nWith the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.\n\nThe birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

Daily measurements can help your ophthalmologist get a better overview of changes in your IOP status. This way, your ophthalmologist can make more informed decisions regarding your glaucoma treatment. \nThe iCare HOME2 tonometer is easy to use in your daily routine. The iCare tonometers use rebound technology, where the rapid and light touch of the measurement probe provides a comfortable measurement without air puff or anesthetics. The results from iCare HOME2 tonometer are reliable as has been proven in multiple scientific studies. \n\nFeatures:\n- Store and access your IOP measurement results anywhere, anytime. \n- View your IOP measurement results in a graph to better visualize and detect important changes in your IOP. \n- Transfer your IOP measurements from your iCare HOME2 tonometer via Bluetooth. \n- Measurement results can be stored in the iCare CLOUD or in the database of your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider must have an iCare CLINIC account in order to use this feature.\n\nNote: Read the “iCare PATIENT2 Instruction manual for iOS”, “iCare PATIENT2 and EXPORT Quick Guide for mobile phones and PC” and “iCare HOME2 Instruction Manual” before using iCare PATIENT2 app with iCare HOME2 tonometer. If you need help in using the iCare HOME2 tonometer, contact your healthcare professional.\n\nUse the tonometer only for measuring intraocular pressure. Any other use is improper. The manufacturer is not liable for any damage arising from improper use, or for the consequences of such use. Patients must not modify or discontinue their treatment plan without receiving guidance from a healthcare professional."

      "label": "This app is designed for people who wish to participate in scientific studies related to the cognitive disorders associated with Dyscalculia.\n\nDyscalculia is a learning disorder that affects arithmetic ability, use of numbers, and the acquisition of mathematics. Dyscalculia is normally detected in childhood, and if not treated properly, the consequences of this learning disorder can continue to have effects into adolescence or adulthood. This can have direct consequences for success in academics, social life, and even at work. It is not uncommon for students with Dyscalculia to reject and avoid any activity that requires calculations, despite the fact that these activities are very common in our daily lives.\n\nPeople living with Dyscalculia can be affected by various alterations in their cognitive abilities. This app is used to investigate the following aspects related to this disorder: Focused Attention, Divided Attention, Spatial Perception, Short-Term Auditory Memory, Working Memory, Planning, and Hand-Eye Coordination.\n\nINVESTIGATIVE TOOL FOR EXPERTS IN NEUROSCIENCE\n\nThis application is designed to promote scientific research by providing digital tools which help in the cognitive evaluation and treatment of people living with this learning disorder related to math. Dyscalculia Cognitive Research is an instrument for the scientific community and universities around the world.\n\nTo participate in research focusing on evaluation and cognitive stimulation related to Dyscalculia, download the APP and experience the most advanced digital tools that are being developed by researchers around the world.\n\nThis app is for research purposes only and does not claim to diagnose or treat Dyscalculia.

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "The mySmartBlood application is an in vitro diagnostic medical device, intended to provide you (symptomatic end-user) the information concerning medical conditions or groups of diseases and the respective physiological or pathological states thereof, using your results of in vitro blood examination.  It operates by using the machine learning model trained on clinical cases.\n\nYou must follow three main steps to obtain results:\n\n1. Measure all the blood parameters from our Mandatory Blood parameter List at your nearest laboratory.\n2. Enter and submit the blood test results in the app.\n3. Receive your mySmartBlood report including the list of most likely groups of diseases and explanations of blood parameters contributing to the results.\n\nBenefit & Risks:\n\nmySmartBlood is a priceless tool to guide you to the right healthcare professional and can significantly shorten your path to the final diagnosis, which is often associated with expensive diagnostic procedures. That way, the mySmartBlood enables your healthcare professional to make faster and more accurate diagnostic decisions and consequently improves your treatment and reduces your costs of the treatment.\n\nBy its inherent design, mySmartBlood does not provide information that could itself be used to confirm or discard health condition, since it always provides a list of max. 5 likely groups of diseases. By providing information in such a format, it enables the healthcare professional to naturally consider multiple options. The interpretation provided by mySmartBlood is only an information to guide you to consult the appropriate healthcare professional.\n\nmySmartBlood is intended to be used for interpreting blood results of Caucasian adult users (older than 18 years old), both female (non-pregnant) and male, with acute and/or chronic conditions in the following fields of internal medicine (Toxicology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Hematology, Nephrology, Pulmonology, Rheumatology).\n\nmySmartBlood is contraindicated for use in: \n\n•\tusers below the age of 18,\n•\temergency situations in general, e.g.:\n        •.signs of a heart attack (severe/heavy/crushing chest pain…),\n        • signs of a stroke (facial weakness, slurred speech, inability to hold both arms up…),\n        • severe breathing problems,\n        • any other untoward sign or symptom that may be of urgent nature or necessitate urgent or emergency care,\n•\tpregnancy.\n\nAdditional Information and Warnings: \n\n•\tmySmartBlood is not a diagnostic medical device and you are not allowed and you should not make any decisions based only on the results obtained by mySmartBlood, without consulting a healthcare professional.\n•\tYour diagnosis shall always be determined by the responsible physician based on all available physical findings, patients’ anamneses, symptoms and results of other diagnostic tests.\n•\tCertain kinds of medication therapy can affect mySmartBlood outputs. When consulting with a healthcare professional, please inform them regarding this. \n•\tmySmartBlood can only be used if all parameters from the Mandatory Blood Parameter List are available and the input of the blood parameters and values are correct.\n•\tmySmartBlood can only predict the groups of diseases that are available in its database. All the available groups of diseases are listed in the Instructions For Use, Annex II.\n•\tYou should use mySmartBlood if you are showing any kind of medical symptoms. mySmartBlood is not designed for screening purposes.\n•\tPlease note that obtainment of the mandatory blood parameter list measurement might be subject to additional costs by your healthcare provider or local laboratory. \n•\tmySmartBlood report is subject to payment of a one-time fee to the amount of CHF 29 per individual report. Please note that exact prices can vary depending on your location, currency and exchange rates."

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device.

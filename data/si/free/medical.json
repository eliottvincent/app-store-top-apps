The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "The mySmartBlood application is an in vitro diagnostic medical device, intended to provide you (symptomatic end-user) the information concerning medical conditions or groups of diseases and the respective physiological or pathological states thereof, using your results of in vitro blood examination.  It operates by using the machine learning model trained on clinical cases.\n\nYou must follow three main steps to obtain results:\n\n1. Measure all the blood parameters from our Mandatory Blood parameter List at your nearest laboratory.\n2. Enter and submit the blood test results in the app.\n3. Receive your mySmartBlood report including the list of most likely groups of diseases and explanations of blood parameters contributing to the results.\n\nBenefit & Risks:\n\nmySmartBlood is a priceless tool to guide you to the right healthcare professional and can significantly shorten your path to the final diagnosis, which is often associated with expensive diagnostic procedures. That way, the mySmartBlood enables your healthcare professional to make faster and more accurate diagnostic decisions and consequently improves your treatment and reduces your costs of the treatment.\n\nBy its inherent design, mySmartBlood does not provide information that could itself be used to confirm or discard health condition, since it always provides a list of max. 5 likely groups of diseases. By providing information in such a format, it enables the healthcare professional to naturally consider multiple options. The interpretation provided by mySmartBlood is only an information to guide you to consult the appropriate healthcare professional.\n\nmySmartBlood is intended to be used for interpreting blood results of Caucasian adult users (older than 18 years old), both female (non-pregnant) and male, with acute and/or chronic conditions in the following fields of internal medicine (Toxicology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Hematology, Nephrology, Pulmonology, Rheumatology).\n\nmySmartBlood is contraindicated for use in: \n\n•\tusers below the age of 18,\n•\temergency situations in general, e.g.:\n        •.signs of a heart attack (severe/heavy/crushing chest pain…),\n        • signs of a stroke (facial weakness, slurred speech, inability to hold both arms up…),\n        • severe breathing problems,\n        • any other untoward sign or symptom that may be of urgent nature or necessitate urgent or emergency care,\n•\tpregnancy.\n\nAdditional Information and Warnings: \n\n•\tmySmartBlood is not a diagnostic medical device and you are not allowed and you should not make any decisions based only on the results obtained by mySmartBlood, without consulting a healthcare professional.\n•\tYour diagnosis shall always be determined by the responsible physician based on all available physical findings, patients’ anamneses, symptoms and results of other diagnostic tests.\n•\tCertain kinds of medication therapy can affect mySmartBlood outputs. When consulting with a healthcare professional, please inform them regarding this. \n•\tmySmartBlood can only be used if all parameters from the Mandatory Blood Parameter List are available and the input of the blood parameters and values are correct.\n•\tmySmartBlood can only predict the groups of diseases that are available in its database. All the available groups of diseases are listed in the Instructions For Use, Annex II.\n•\tYou should use mySmartBlood if you are showing any kind of medical symptoms. mySmartBlood is not designed for screening purposes.\n•\tPlease note that obtainment of the mandatory blood parameter list measurement might be subject to additional costs by your healthcare provider or local laboratory. \n•\tmySmartBlood report is subject to payment of a one-time fee to the amount of CHF 29 per individual report. Please note that exact prices can vary depending on your location, currency and exchange rates."

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently.

      "label": "Suffering from IBS? The Low FODMAP Diet can help relief your symptoms and be free of IBS for good. Low FODMAP Lifestyle is the easiest way to look up which foods are high FODMAP and low FODMAP.\n\nThis app is build by Lifeplano and we know what IBS and the low FODMAP diet is about, because one of our founders have followed it himself. It is a very restrictive diet and therefore harder to follow, but we have made it so much easier with Low FODMAP Lifestyle.\n\n*Functionalities*\n- Low FODMAP food list\n- Personal testing of every food\n- More than 40+ recipes\n- Basic knowledge about IBS and FODMAPs\n\n*What is IBS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome?*\nIBS is a condition where your gut have trouble digesting foods with certain carbohydrates: Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Mannitols and Polyols. Which carbohydrates you react too can be different from others, as the amount also can, which is why it is a very personal diet.\n\nIt is estimated by scientists at the Australian Monash University that 1 in 7 suffers from IBS and it is a lifestyle condition mainly present in western countries.\n\n*What is the Low FODMAP Diet?*\nMonash University are also the inventors of the Low FODMAP Diet. It is a diet that helps you find out exactly what carbohydrates and foods your gut reacts to and in what amount, so you can limit or exclude that from your diet going forward.\n\nThe IBS diet consist of three phases:\n- Phase 1: The eliminations phase - Here you eliminate FODMAPs from your diet until you are symptom free.\n- Phase 2: The reintroduction phase - Here you slowly reintroduce the different carbohydrates, and test which ones cause reactions.\n- Phase 3: The personal diet phase - You now have a personal diet, but IBS can develop over time, so you need to retest foods again to see if your tolerance changed.\n\nWith our app you can also test new foods and drinks that haven't been tested yet and see if you tolerate it. Examples could be a can of Pepsi or ketchup which are both processed groceries with unknown levels of FODMAPs.\n\nThe diet can seem very restrictive if you are new to it, and it is proved that restrictive diets are the hardest to follow. With Low FODMAP Lifestyle we have made the diet more available so it seems easier to follow and less restrictive. Follow our low FODMAP recipes, get symptom free and test new foods every week, to make your personal diet and low FODMAP food list.\n\n______________________________\nTerms of use: https://bornly.com/terms-of-service/\n\nMedical disclaimer\nWE ARE NOT DOCTORS AND DO NOT GIVE MEDICAL ADVICE.

Results are presented as a “Traffic Light” system (red, amber, green) to indicate the recommendation. A brief summary of each interaction is given. The application is available free of charge and has been developed by the Liverpool Drug Interactions Group at the University of Liverpool and Clubzap Ltd. \n\nRequirements:\nThis is an “offline” application that is downloaded to your device. An internet connection is not required to use the application, but is needed for downloading updates.\n\nWhy this application may be useful:\nIn hepatitis therapy, patients take more than one hepatitis medication at a time and possibly other drugs to treat co-existing conditions. Many of the drug combinations have the potential to interact and this can affect either the patient's safety or the effectiveness of treatment. For this reason some drug combinations should not be given at all, while other drugs may be used together with caution, possibly requiring adjustments to dosage or time of administration. This application is a guide to interactions that may occur between different hepatitis drugs and other medications that the HCV- and/or HBV-infected patient may be prescribed. The application is regularly updated as new data emerge.  Full details about the interactions can be found at www.hep-druginteractions.org."

      "label": "E-polyTrauma application is a support tool focused on a key aspect of prehospital medicine, the initial assessment of the polytraumatized patients.\n\nIt follows the XABCDE approach, which sequentially and systematically evaluates each of the patient's systems, prioritizing the search for and treatment of life-threatening injuries. This procedure uses the latest recommendations from the PHTLS (PreHospital Trauma Life Support) manual.\n\nIn the XABCDE approach, each letter corresponds to a system:\n   - X: Exsanguination.\n   - A: Airway.\n   - B: Breathing.\n   - C: Circulation.\n   - D: Disability.\n   - E: Exposure.\n\nTraditionally, the ABCDE approach has been followed for the assessment of polytraumatized patients. However, the most recent recommendations aim to start with the treatment of exsanguinating hemorrhages, since it has been confirmed that they are the first preventable cause of death in this type of patient. For this reason, the X from Exsanguination has been included as the first step of the approach.\n\nE-polyTrauma application helps in this first evaluation of the polytraumatized patient, exposing the steps to follow and offering recommendations for action based on data entered. In addition, it stores a record of the simulations in a local database (so no Internet connection is needed), and the results can be exported to Excel files for later analysis. Once downloaded, these Excel files will be accessible following the path: Files – On my iPhone/iPad – e-polyTrauma.\n\nThe application has been originally designed with the purpose of giving support to the students of Advanced Clinical Simulation in the sixth year of Medicine Degree at University of Valladolid. For this reason, it has certain functionalities such as the 10-minute timer, which is the time that students have to carry out the simulations developed in the Advanced Clinical Simulation Center of the faculty itself. For this reason, e-polyTrauma focuses on two very new fields, mHealth and mLearning (the use of mobile technology in the fields of health and education respectively).\n\nThe application is available in both English and Spanish. Displayed language is selected based on device's system preferences.\n\nAlthough e-polyTrauma application contains verified information offered by specialists, it may not be exhaustive, exact or completely up-to-date. Therefore we are not responsible for any damage caused by the use of such information.\n\nThe application has been developed in the GTe: Telemedicine and eHealth Group of the University of Valladolid. This is an international multidisciplinary group made up of doctorates in telecommunications and computer science and doctors from different specialties.\n\nIt has been part of the final degree project entitled: \"Mobile application to help in the study of the subject 'Advanced Clinical Simulation' of Medicine Degree\".\n\nE-polyTrauma authors are:\n   - Miguel Cantón González (Graduated in Telecommunications Technology Engineering).\n   - Isabel de la Torre Díez (Doctor and professor at Telecommunications Engineers Higher Technical School - UVa).\n   - Francisco Martín Rodríguez (Doctor and professor at Medicine Faculty - UVa).\n\nIf you have any question, comment or suggestion, send an email to: epolitrauma@gmail.com."

      "label": "• THE FIRST AND ONLY LANGUAGE THERAPY APPLICATION SUPPORTED BY CLINICAL DATA:\nIn a 3-year clinical trial of 6,454 children with autism, language score in children who engaged with MITA has increased to levels, which were 120% higher than in children with similar initial evaluations. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.0001). See results at ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04108290. \n\n• Received FDA breakthrough device designation (Q210093)\n\n• Based on US patent 20160210870\n\n• Includes unlimited language and cognitive exercises designed to last for 10 years\n\n• Used by over 1.5 million children with language delay\n\n• Best Autism App on Healthline list\n\n• Available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Farsi, Korean, Chinese.\n\nMental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children with language delay and autism. MITA trains mental integration and language, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and syntax.\n\n\nMITA EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES\n\n• Based on ABA techniques of visual-visual and auditory-visual conditional discrimination.\n• Based on language therapy technique of following directions with increasing complexity.\n• Based on Pivotal Response Treatment. \n• Each activity is adaptive and delivers exercises that are at the exact level of difficulty appropriate for your child at any given point in time\n• Identify colors, patterns and sizes\n• Integrate objects into a unified picture\n• Spatial Prepositions: on/under/behind/in front\n• Time prepositions: Before/After\n• Passive verb tense\n• Subject / Object\n• Reading and Writing\n• Numbers and counting\n• Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division\n• Logic and reasoning\n• Mental perspective taking\n• Mental mathematics\n• Critical thinking \n• Self-control\n• Attention\n• Working Memory\n• Creativity\n• Playtime rewards will keep your child engaged while learning and having fun\n• No Wi-Fi necessary\n\nMITA develops your child’s imagination and language functions. The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing your child's ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size or color. Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size. MITA then moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape, and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. \nThe verbal exercises use higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.\n\nMITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J. Elgart and a group of award-winning artists and developers working alongside experienced therapists.\n\nMost MITA features are completely free and the free MITA version provides access to years of language therapy. Some additional features are available as a MITA Premium subscription for $69.99/year. Your subscription pays for the development of new language exercises that are added each month. \n\n• Tuition will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Tuition automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• You can turn off auto-renewal by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that plan.\n\nTerms of use: http://imagiration.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy Policy: http://imagiration.com/privacy-policy/\nMITA in the news: https://youtu.be/giZymh3rMHc\nMITA research articles: http://imagiration.com/research/"

Over 1,000,000 people have downloaded our mobile electronic eye charts for iOS. \n\nThis version is our best for iPhone, and it's now completely free.\n\nUseful for:\n- Triaging\n- House visits\n- Patients who have memorized the office chart\n\nFeatures:\n- Randomizable Snellen Chart\n- Randomizable Tumbling E Chart\n- Randomizable Sloan Letters Chart\n- Randomizable Landolt C Chart\n- Randomizable Near Vision Chart (w/subscription)\n- Line Isolation (w/subscription)\n- Amsler Grid (w/subscription)\n- Single optotype charts (w/subscription)\n\nDescription:\n\nEyeChart is a pocket vision screener: randomized Snellen, Sloan, Tumbling E, and Landolt C charts to offer a rough but useful screen of visual acuity. Simply press a button to randomize the entire eye chart, or touch an individual line of the chart to randomize that line. Swipe right for the chart selector.\n\nEye care professionals around the world use Snellen Eye Charts to measure visual acuity. However, patients often memorize the classic Snellen chart, leading to less accurate vision measurements. Enter EyeChart! Though this unique, pocket-sized randomizable eye chart should not be used as a primary visual acuity measuring tool, it can provide a handy rough vision screen when a chart is not available, or it can be used to complement static, wall-based Snellen charts.\n\nSubscription:\n\nIn addition to our free features, EyeChart offers a subscription to exclusive paid features, including the Randomizable Near Vision Chart, Line Isolation, Amsler Grid, and Single Optotype Charts! The subscription costs $0.99 per month of access, and is available through an auto-renewing subscription which will renew each month for your convenience until you choose to turn it off. Please let us know if you have any questions about your subscription at eyechartapp@gmail.com.\n\nCheck out our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy at eyechartproapp.com/termsofuse.\n\nEyeChart was made with the best of intentions, and we hope to continue improving it. Your feedback is appreciated!"

The immediate care provided at the site of injury will determine the survival of the injured tooth and the smile of your child. This App should be in every mobile device of everyone around the world. In order to save more teeth and smiles, it’s important you share this App with as many people you can. Start with friends, relatives, teachers and coaches.\n\nFor Professionals, quick access to the Dental Trauma Guidelines provide detailed information caring for patients with dental injuries.  They represent the current evidence based on literature research and professional opinion, as well as additional information about the IADT and resources for continuing education.  As is true for all guidelines, the health care provider must apply clinical judgment dictated by the conditions present in the given traumatic situation. The IADT does not guarantee favorable outcomes from following the Guidelines, but using the recommended procedures can maximize the chances of success."

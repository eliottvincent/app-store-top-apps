The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

      "label": "Erby helps you easily track and record breastfeeding, newborn activity, sleep statistics. It's also a handy food diary for your baby and nursing mom!\n\nYou will be able to make sure that the newborn is getting enough breast milk and to establish the daily baby care. Enter information about food, beverages, medications and supplements you are taking. This will help identify allergic reactions in the infant.\n\nLACTATION\n\nStart the breastfeeding timer with one click! Track the duration of feedings, easily remember which breast you fed the last time: this will help to establish breastfeeding and avoid lactostasis. Record data on pumping and responses to the first complementary foods.\n\nPUMPING\n\nConsider the volume of expressed milk with the option to start the feeding timer separately for each breast or both at the same time.\nKeep records of frozen milk - make sure you have enough stocks in your milk stash\n\nSLEEP\n\nUse a sleep tracker and note down when your child is asleep and awake. Record night and day sleep to understand baby's sleep and wake patterns\n\nDIAPERS\n\nSchedule your diaper change so you know how many diapers you need. Write urination (with volume as needed) and bowel movements separately\n\nHEALTH, FEEDING\n\nMark various symptoms and temperature, enter data on vitamins,  medicines and vaccination. \nRecord complementary feeding data and track the baby's response. Monitor your baby's weight gain and growth. Watch for teething. Erby is great for visiting a pediatrician.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nRecord bathing and walking, tummy time, games, massage. \n\nSTATISTICS AND HISTORY\n\nView event statistics so you can spot trends and, if necessary, make adjustments to your baby's care. Study your daily routine. A complete history of events, the ability to filter them by type (for example, only walks or pump log) is always at your fingertips.\n\nREMINDERS\n\nSet reminders for the events you need. You will not miss your medication and will not forget to feed or put your child to bed at the right time.\n\nErby is not just a baby development journal, it is a memory of your precious first months with him.\n\nYou can keep a diary for multiple children. Suitable for twins!\n\nOur breast feeding app was created to help even the most sleep-deprived parents keep track of their baby's progress up to one year old by recording daily activities and feeding statistics in this easy-to-use diary.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/erby/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/erby/ios/\n\n\nWe are always glad to receive your questions, suggestions and comments.

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

Zaradi različnih vzrokov ljudje prve pomoči v nesreči pogosto ne nudijo, kar ima za posledico večje zdravstvene zaplete pri poškodovanih ali obolelih osebah. Rezultati mnogih raziskav kažejo, da je problem povezan predvsem s pomanjkanjem znanja o pravilnem nudenju prve pomoči. Po drugi strani pa ustrezna prva pomoč dokazano zmanjšuje število in trajanje hospitalizacij, prispeva k učinkovitejšemu zdravljenju, boljšemu okrevanju, večji kakovosti življenja po poškodbi ali obolenju, ter tako dolgoročno pozitivno vpliva na zdravstveno blagajno, zmanjšuje okoljsko obremenjenost in povečuje splošno blaginjo prebivalstva.\r\n\r\nMobilna aplikacija Prva pomoč pokriva dva usklajena sklopa izobraževalno-informacijskih vsebin:\r\n• Pomoč uporabnikom za učinkovito nudenje prve pomoči v primeru nastanka poškodb in najpogostejših nenadnih obolenj.\r\n• Povečanje ravni znanja prve pomoči med splošno populacijo (pridobivanje doktrinarno ustreznih napotkov za nudenje prve pomoči, ocenjevanje znanja, obnavljanje/utrjevanje znanja, spodbujanje učenja prve pomoči, zmanjševanje predsodkov pred nudenjem prve pomoči, spodbujanje solidarnosti in zavedanja pomena pomoči sočloveku v stiski).\r\n\r\nStrokovne vsebine aplikacije temeljijo na smernicah Evropskega referenčnega centra za prvo pomoč ter Strokovnega centra za prvo pomoč Rdečega križa Slovenije. Gre za besedilni, slikovni in video prikaz temeljnih vsebin in napotkov za prvo pomoč, namenjenih tako splošni javnosti kot tudi različnim skupinam in organizacijam (šolam, delovnim organizacijam, društvom, ekipam prve pomoči …).\r\n\r\nV sklopu razvoja aplikacije smo strokovno vsebino razvili skupaj z Rdečim Križem Slovenije, Univerzitetnim kliničnim centrom (UKC) Ljubljana, Univerzo v Ljubljani - Zdravstveno fakulteto  in Univerzo v Mariboru - Fakulteto za organizacijske vede - Laboratorijem za ergonomijo."

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

Or to gain confidence before performing a procedure you perform less commonly?\n \nThe Dechra Dog & Cat Anaesthesia app is a unique resource designed to put practical, accessible information into the hands of veterinarians, veterinary nurses/technicians and vet students. Developed with specialist veterinary anaesthetists and approved by the Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists (AVA), the app contains suggested anaesthetic protocols for 24 procedures in the dog and 15 in the cat. It is like having a veterinary anaesthetist in your pocket!\n \nEach procedure contains up to date, detailed anaesthetic considerations for the patient including pre-op stabilisation where required, appropriate premedication options, peri-operative analgesia and details about induction, maintenance, monitoring, and recovery. This allows you to choose the most appropriate protocol for every unique patient.\nThe app also contains information about 36 of the most commonly used molecules in dog and cat anaesthesia, allowing you to confidently choose and use the most appropriate molecule for every situation. A suggested dosage and route of administration is given, alongside information about indication, time to onset and duration of action, contraindications and side effects.\nThe app includes an easy to use dose calculator so that you can quickly calculate the doses required for your patient and also allows you to design your own protocols. Each completed protocol can be saved into your favourites folder to use again, or you can email the protocol summary to be saved in the patient’s clinical records, or to be printed.\n\nDechra are advocates of patient safety and are keen to promote best practice anaesthesia. As part of this commitment we have included the AVA Anaesthetic Safety Checklist within the app. The Dechra Dog and Cat Anaesthesia App reinforces Dechra as leaders in veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia and provides unprecedented technical support to veterinary professionals."

      "label": "Help when you need it, for those with seizure disorders. \n\nSeizAlarm is a user-friendly iPhone and Apple Watch app which allows those with epilepsy and other seizure disorders to alert emergency contacts when they need help*.  \n\nFeatures:\n\n- Seizure detection.  Seizure-like detection is done via the motion sensors on the iPhone and/or motion sensors or heart rate sensor on the Apple Watch.  Sensitivity controls allow you to set customized settings specific to you.  When a potential seizure is detected, emergency contacts will automatically be contacted via multiple channels (text message, phone call, and email). \n\n- Send immediate help requests manually to emergency contacts. \n\n- Also available is a manually activated time delayed help request feature (via the \"Time Delayed Help\" button) that is helpful for those that have localized seizures (auras) that may turn into generalized tonic-clonic seizures. You are able to custom set the delay time in the settings.  When a seizure warning is initiated you will see a countdown which can be extended via the press of a button.  If you end up becoming unresponsive due to a seizure then once the timer ends then a help request will be sent.\n\n- When a help request is sent your contacts will be contacted with GPS coordinates (if available), so they know exactly where you are.  \n\n- You can are also able to track your seizure events with robust logging features. A log dashboard gives you a high-level view of past events.  You can also export reports to provide to your doctor. \n\n- SeizAlarm also supports multiple emergency contact support, so more than one person can be contacted when you need help. \n\n- Optional audible siren and/or custom voice message that plays if a help request is sent.\n\n- International phone number support for emergency contact(s).\n\nHelp is just a button press away. Start taking back your independence today.\n\nPlease give us feedback on how the seizure detection is working for you.  The more feedback we receive will provide us the information we need to improve detection and reduce false alarms in future versions.\n\nIf you have any questions or have feedback, please contact us at: contact@seizalarm.com.  We want to make SeizAlarm the best that it can be, so feedback from our users is very important to us.\n\nNOTES:\n- Does not support a Watch set up with \"Family Setup\".\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n- Recommended placement of the iPhone for seizure detection is on the arm using an arm band.\n- Long use of Watch based seizure-like motion and elevated heart rate detection may dramatically decrease watch battery life.\n\n\n*New accounts receive a 2 week trial of the \"Alerts\" service which allows the user to manually or automatically (via seizure-like motion detection) request help from emergency contacts.  Once the trial ends, the user must subscribe to the \"Alerts\" service to continue to have the ability to request help.  The \"Alerts\" service is an auto-renewing cost of $14.99/month or $149.99/year.  \n\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n\n* The payment will be charged to the user's iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.  The account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.  \n\n* Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.  \n\n* No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period.  Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.  The robust seizure log features require no subscription.\n\nPrivacy policy: http://www.seizalarm.com/seizalarm_app-privacy-policy.pdf\nEnd User License Agreement: http://www.seizalarm.com/seizalarm_EULA.pdf"

This process aims to place some distance between the child and the blame shame of soiling. This helps to free them from their fears and may mobilise previously beleaguered resources within the child and their family.  'Externalising' stories have proved valuable in engaging children in behavioural treatment programmes wihtin a family therapy context. However, you may find them useful in combination with your chosen therapeutic style.   The style and content of 'Poo Goes Home to Pooland; was designed to suit the cognitive development stage of children up to around seven years of age. Individually illustrations and accompanying text is intended to promote understanding of toileting matters and relieve anxiety. They cover topics such as sharing unhappy feeling and how to reorganise when you need to poo.  Talking about 'Pooland' might help you to engage in getting control over their poo.\n\nDr Tamsin Black wrote and illustrated ‘Poo Goes Home to Pooland’ in her final year of Doctoral Training in Clinical Psychology at the University of Newcastle and on clinical placement (with John Sands, Consultant Clinical Psychologist) at the Linhope Unit, Ashington, part of Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust.

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

It operates by using the machine learning model trained on clinical cases.\n\nYou must follow three main steps to obtain results:\n\n1. Measure all the blood parameters from our Mandatory Blood parameter List at your nearest laboratory.\n2. Enter and submit the blood test results in the app.\n3. Receive your mySmartBlood report including the list of most likely groups of diseases and explanations of blood parameters contributing to the results.\n\nBenefit & Risks:\n\nmySmartBlood is a priceless tool to guide you to the right healthcare professional and can significantly shorten your path to the final diagnosis, which is often associated with expensive diagnostic procedures. That way, the mySmartBlood enables your healthcare professional to make faster and more accurate diagnostic decisions and consequently improves your treatment and reduces your costs of the treatment.\n\nBy its inherent design, mySmartBlood does not provide information that could itself be used to confirm or discard health condition, since it always provides a list of max. 5 likely groups of diseases. By providing information in such a format, it enables the healthcare professional to naturally consider multiple options. The interpretation provided by mySmartBlood is only an information to guide you to consult the appropriate healthcare professional.\n\nmySmartBlood is intended to be used for interpreting blood results of Caucasian adult users (older than 18 years old), both female (non-pregnant) and male, with acute and/or chronic conditions in the following fields of internal medicine (Toxicology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Hematology, Nephrology, Pulmonology, Rheumatology).\n\nmySmartBlood is contraindicated for use in: \n\n•\tusers below the age of 18,\n•\temergency situations in general, e.g.:\n        •.signs of a heart attack (severe/heavy/crushing chest pain…),\n        • signs of a stroke (facial weakness, slurred speech, inability to hold both arms up…),\n        • severe breathing problems,\n        • any other untoward sign or symptom that may be of urgent nature or necessitate urgent or emergency care,\n•\tpregnancy.\n\nAdditional Information and Warnings: \n\n•\tmySmartBlood is not a diagnostic medical device and you are not allowed and you should not make any decisions based only on the results obtained by mySmartBlood, without consulting a healthcare professional.\n•\tYour diagnosis shall always be determined by the responsible physician based on all available physical findings, patients’ anamneses, symptoms and results of other diagnostic tests.\n•\tCertain kinds of medication therapy can affect mySmartBlood outputs. When consulting with a healthcare professional, please inform them regarding this. \n•\tmySmartBlood can only be used if all parameters from the Mandatory Blood Parameter List are available and the input of the blood parameters and values are correct.\n•\tmySmartBlood can only predict the groups of diseases that are available in its database. All the available groups of diseases are listed in the Instructions For Use, Annex II.\n•\tYou should use mySmartBlood if you are showing any kind of medical symptoms. mySmartBlood is not designed for screening purposes.\n•\tPlease note that obtainment of the mandatory blood parameter list measurement might be subject to additional costs by your healthcare provider or local laboratory. \n•\tmySmartBlood report is subject to payment of a one-time fee to the amount of CHF 29 per individual report. Please note that exact prices can vary depending on your location, currency and exchange rates."

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

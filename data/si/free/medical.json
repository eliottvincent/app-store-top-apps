      "label": "S povečanjem števila nesreč in nenadnih obolenj se povečujejo potrebe po nudenju prve pomoči. Zaradi različnih vzrokov ljudje prve pomoči v nesreči pogosto ne nudijo, kar ima za posledico večje zdravstvene zaplete pri poškodovanih ali obolelih osebah. Rezultati mnogih raziskav kažejo, da je problem povezan predvsem s pomanjkanjem znanja o pravilnem nudenju prve pomoči. Po drugi strani pa ustrezna prva pomoč dokazano zmanjšuje število in trajanje hospitalizacij, prispeva k učinkovitejšemu zdravljenju, boljšemu okrevanju, večji kakovosti življenja po poškodbi ali obolenju, ter tako dolgoročno pozitivno vpliva na zdravstveno blagajno, zmanjšuje okoljsko obremenjenost in povečuje splošno blaginjo prebivalstva.\r\n\r\nMobilna aplikacija Prva pomoč pokriva dva usklajena sklopa izobraževalno-informacijskih vsebin:\r\n• Pomoč uporabnikom za učinkovito nudenje prve pomoči v primeru nastanka poškodb in najpogostejših nenadnih obolenj.\r\n• Povečanje ravni znanja prve pomoči med splošno populacijo (pridobivanje doktrinarno ustreznih napotkov za nudenje prve pomoči, ocenjevanje znanja, obnavljanje/utrjevanje znanja, spodbujanje učenja prve pomoči, zmanjševanje predsodkov pred nudenjem prve pomoči, spodbujanje solidarnosti in zavedanja pomena pomoči sočloveku v stiski).\r\n\r\nStrokovne vsebine aplikacije temeljijo na smernicah Evropskega referenčnega centra za prvo pomoč ter Strokovnega centra za prvo pomoč Rdečega križa Slovenije. Gre za besedilni, slikovni in video prikaz temeljnih vsebin in napotkov za prvo pomoč, namenjenih tako splošni javnosti kot tudi različnim skupinam in organizacijam (šolam, delovnim organizacijam, društvom, ekipam prve pomoči …).\r\n\r\nV sklopu razvoja aplikacije smo strokovno vsebino razvili skupaj z Rdečim Križem Slovenije, Univerzitetnim kliničnim centrom (UKC) Ljubljana, Univerzo v Ljubljani - Zdravstveno fakulteto  in Univerzo v Mariboru - Fakulteto za organizacijske vede - Laboratorijem za ergonomijo."

With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\n\n\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals. It is a tool that anyone working in the medical industry should possess.\"\n\n\"Great app for keeping your skills sharp and seeing a wide variety of cases\"\n\nECG Pro provides: \n\n1) 3500+ abnormal real world 12 lead ECG cases in raw data (In-App-Purchase needed for advanced ones)\n2) Each case has professional interpretation and measurement \n3) They cover 100+ common ECG findings \n\n[Features] \n1) Browse ECG cases by findings like \"Atrial Flutter\", \"Escape Rhythm\" and more \n2) Search for whatever you want to learn, like \"Flat T wave\" \n3) Dynamically play each case in monitoring mode (with beeping sound) \n4) Display leads in 12 x 1, 6 x 2, 4 x 3 layout \n5) Each case has 12 template views with P / QRS / T waves identified \n6) Send cases to your friends, in PDF format \n\nFor students or interns, you can use the cases as learning resources. \nFor teachers, you can use the cases as teaching resources. \n\n[Note] \n1) All cases are stored in raw data (sample rate is 500hz), not static images, so you can look into very detailed waves in pixels \n2) You should already have basic knowledge of ECG interpretation, and you use the cases to build a solid cardiology foundation \n\n[Findings Covered] \nAtrial Flutter \nAtrial Fibrillation \nVentricular Fibrillation \nEscape Beat \nPAC (Premature Atrial Contruction) \nPAC Bigeminy \nPAC Trigeminy \nPVC (Premature Ventricular Contruction) \nPVC Bigeminy \nPVC Trigeminy \nSupraventricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Escape Rhythm \nVentricular Rhythm \nQT Prolongation \nShort QT \nHigh T \nST Elevation \nS1,S2,S3 Pattern \nHigh Voltage \nPositive T in V1 \nVentricular Hypertrophy \n\nand more..."

It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

Improve your sleep naturally, maximize your sleep efficiency. \n\nSTOP SNORING\nTries to stop your snoring by playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected.\n\nBy using the tracker data and by defining your own factors (activities/means/drugs/custom notes) it is possible to find out which facts influence your sleep positively and limit your snoring. At your disposal there are beautiful statistic charts for simple and efficient analyzing of your sleeps/nights.\n\nSnoring detection is based on artificial intelligence (A.I.) with the support of a new Apple machine learning technology. By using a large number of snoring samples, we can achieve high accuracy in statistics and in snoring detection itself.\n\nHow to place your device correctly is shown in instructions. \n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- ADJUSTABLE RECORDING SOUND SENSITIVITY:\nFor different sound conditions in your room (a quiet or loud environment).\n\n- HIGH TECH SNORING DETECTION:\nAccurate snoring detection based on A.I.\n\n- POSSIBILITY OF RECORDING ONLY SNORING\n\n- AUDIO VISUALIZATION DURING RECORDING OR PLAYING\n\n- FAVORITE RECORDINGS\n\n- SHARING RECORDINGS WITH YOUR FRIENDS:\nSend recordings via email, iMessage or post to Facebook\n\n- UNLIMITED ALARMS: \nSet your own alarms, daily alarms, weekly alarms, etc. You can use included alarm sounds or your own iPod music.\n\n- SMART WAKE UP: \nWake you up with gradual alarm when you are in your lightest sleep phase (based on your movements).\n\n- SLEEP TRACKER:\nSleep cycle analyzes and statistics with complete history and beautiful charts.\n\n- SNOOZE BY SHAKING:\nNo need to unlock screen or enter password.\n\n- STOP SNORING:\nPossibility of playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected. \n\n- FACTORS, WAKE UP MOOD, NOTES:\nUser can place factors (alcohol, coffee, stress etc.) to every night as well as the mood after waking up or users own notes.\n\n- ACTIVATION DELAY:\nStart monitoring after a period of time.\n\n- BACKGROUND MODE:\nMonitoring runs also in background mode. Alarm also fires from background.\n\n- APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION\n\n- iCLOUD SYNCHRONIZATION:\nSynchronization among your devices and between free and paid version.\n\n- EXPORTING HISTORY TO CSV FILE\n\n- APPLE WATCH:\nTracks your sleep movements and plays haptic (sound, vibration) if alarm is triggered or snoring is detected.\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\nHappy customers are our highest priority.

This HIPAA compliant solution allows clinicians to remotely monitor an unlimited number of patients and see who most needs their attention and who is doing well, all with a click of button. \n\nQardioDirect App:\n\n• Gives healthcare professionals an additional way to onboard new patients easily\n• Works with Qardio devices for in-clinic and at-home measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, ECG, heart rate, irregular heartbeat detection, blood oxygen level, temperature, weight, BMI and full body composition\n• Lets doctors demonstrate Qardio products to patients\n\nHow it works:\n\nPatients use FDA-cleared Qardio devices to monitor their health outside the doctor's office, which automatically share vitals with their provider.\n\nProviders use HIPAA-compliant QardioMD services. When a patient takes a measurement, the data is displayed in the secure QardioMD web portal.\n\nQardio does the rest. QardioMD continuously displays patient data, and with easy to use filters shows who needs priority attention.\n\nQardioDirect and Apple Health work seamlessly together, enabling easier health tracking with all your health and wellness information in one place. \n\nWhat other doctors have to say about Qardio:\n\n“I believe that good, high quality home blood pressure monitoring devices are going to be critical for achieving better blood pressure control in the US population. I’ve been very impressed with the QardioArm device, which we are currently using in the Health eHeart Study.” - Mark Pletcher, Health eHeart Study Principal Investigator, UCSF\n\n“As a physician, I believe people need to take control of their health and outcomes and this product being so easy to use, portable and most importantly accurate is a product I would recommend to all. Since stopping my denial and becoming a patient myself, I have done just that. Folks, the newest data regarding BP is irrefutable and having just one reading at a doctor’s office every so often is, in my opinion, the wrong way to detect hypertension and products like these should become part of a person's routine, especially as we age and our vessels become less compliant.” HB, Physician and QardioArm User, Amazon Review.\n\nQardioArm and QardioCore have regulatory clearance in the United States, European Economic Area, Canada. Qardio’s products and application should be only used in conjunction with professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and not as a substitute, or a replacement for it."

      "label": "DAV-EXP è un sistema esperto messo a punto dal GAVeCeLT per presentare in forma semplice e chiara un algoritmo per la scelta del dispositivo per accesso venoso (DAV) più appropriato per la singola situazione clinica.\n\nAbbiamo volutamente escluso da questo algoritmo i dispositivi posizionati per manovre di scambio ematico tipo emodialisi, aferesi e ultrafiltrazione: ci riferiremo soltanto agli accessi venosi indicati per terapie infusionali, per monitoraggio emodinamico e/o per necessità di prelievi ematici frequenti e ripetuti. Pur esistendo in letteratura molti algoritmi, di diverso valore e accuratezza, l'algoritmo di scelta presentato come DAV-EXP è il primo - a nostra conoscenza - che copre tutte le fasce di età di pazienti (neonato - bambino - adulto), in ogni situazione clinica (emergenza - elezione), sia in ambito intensivo che non intensivo, trattando l'accesso venoso sia a breve che a medio-lungo termine.\n\nCon l'aiuto di diversi esperti GAVeCeLT, abbiamo cercato di proporre soluzioni basate sulle migliori evidenze scientifiche presenti in letteratura, interpretando la appropriatezza in termini di (1) sicurezza per il paziente, (2) efficacia clinica del dispositivo, e (3) costo-efficacia della scelta (in termini di utilizzo di risorse ed efficienza aziendale).\n\nPoichè il settore degli accessi venosi è in continua evoluzione, tale algoritmo non va interpretato in maniera dogmatica e 'ingessata', bensì come un strumento dinamico e mutabile, in sintonia con la letteratura internazionale che propone di continuo nuove soluzioni e nuovi dispositivi. Gli utenti del DAV-EXP sono perciò invitati a inviarci commenti e suggerimenti, segnalando possibili novità e correggendo eventuali sviste od omissioni.\n\nIn ultimo, ricordiamo che il DAV-EXP non va considerato come una linea guida di riferimento, nè come una scorciatoia per una scelta non meditata; vuol essere invece uno strumento per facilitare il ragionamento clinico in situazioni potenzialmente complesse, in cui è utile tenere a mente tutte le possibili soluzioni ed il pro e il contro di ogni scelta. La selezione del dispositivo per accesso venoso è e rimarrà una decisione clinica che l'operatore sanitario (medico o infermiere) dovrà prendere caso per caso, dopo aver valutato le necessità del singolo paziente e le risorse della propria unità operativa."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

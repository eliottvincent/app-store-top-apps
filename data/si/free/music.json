      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

Zato je potrebno da imate pristup internetu kako bi je koristili.\n\nNešto nije do nas:\n- Neke radio stanice imaju limite za maksimalni broj slušalaca, pa će delovati kao da ne rade, molimo Vas pokušajte ponovo za nekoliko minuta.\n- Neke radio stanice nemaju listu pesama uživo.\n\nHvala vam sto slušate radio stanice iz Srbije i koristite aplikaciju Radio Uživo Srbija."

It strongly depends on what kind of performer you are, but for me it was quite annoying that there is no possibility to switch to the next scene without having to interrupt your performance.\n\nWorks with both PC and Mac, connects through WiFi"

      "label": "A chromatic tuner and pitch pipe used by over a million musicians.\n\nPitched Tuner and Pitch Pipe has been designed by musicians to help you quickly and easily tune your instrument using the microphone on your device.\nIt works well for a wide range of instruments: Ukulele, violin, mandolin, flute, guitars, voice, and more.  Even very low bass strings can be tuned. Simple controls and clear visuals make it great for beginners.  Responsive and precise algorithms provide professional level accuracy for more advanced players.\n\nHands free tuning means you can tune all of your strings without ever having to touch the screen - you don't want to have to reach for your ukulele tuner in between tuning each string, and now you don't have to.\n\nThis tuner app has two modes: \n - Instrument tuner\n - Chromatic tuner \n\nThe instrument tuner shows you the target notes for the instrument and tuning that you have selected - this is particularly useful for stringed instruments.  For example a guitar tuner would show the notes EADGBE if you chose standard guitar tuning, or DADGBE if you chose drop D tuning.  Or a violin tuner would show GDAE.  You can then just play each string and the tuner will identify whether you are in tune.  Pitched Tuner has built in tunings for many common instruments including banjo, bass 4, 5 and 6 string, cello, double bass, guitar including 7 string, ukulele, viola and violin.  If your instrument or your preferred tuning aren't included then you can easily create your own in the app.  Please email us if you want your tuning added to the built in ones.\n\nThe chromatic tuner displays the note that is closest to what is currently being played.  If you play an A, it shows an A.  This is useful for instruments with lots of notes (piano tuning for example).  Some stringed players might also prefer this mode - particularly if you play instruments with several common tunings such as the guitar (it's personal preference!).  It means you can quickly tune your guitar from standard to drop D without having to touch the app (assuming it's already visible on your screen).\n\nPitched Tuner displays a traditional tuner needle and dial. It clearly shows the frequency being played as well as the nearest note and error in cents (one cent is one hundredth of a semitone). The dial then allows you to easily track small changes in pitch. A separate volume indicator tells you how clearly the microphone is picking up your instrument sound.\n\nOther features include:\n-\tVary the reference tuning pitch away from the common 440Hz.  \n-\tAble to adjust for non-concert pitch instruments, for example the B-flat trumpet. \n-\tChoice of light or dark themes \n-\tAdjust the volume sensitivity of the app for quieter instruments and noisy environments.\n\nThis tuning app also works as a pitch pipe and can sound a reference note to tune your instrument by ear (which is always a good skill to practice), or use as a target note when you are re-stringing your guitar/violin/etc.  You can choose from a pure sine sound, which is precise but quiet, or a simulated piano, guitar or clarinet.\n\nWe hope you find Pitched Tuner useful.  You can always contact us at support@stonekick.com"

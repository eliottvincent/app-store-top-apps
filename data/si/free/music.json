      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

Multiple instances of the app can be connected to the hardware simultaneously, allowing both musicians and technicians to adjust the bus mixes.\n\nWING Q offers the same personal monitoring functions of WING CoPilot in a condensed and optimized way for smartphones. The Monitor Mixing UI is reduced to the essential parameters of personalized monitoring applications and offers an additional lock function to reduce the risk of accidentally selecting the wrong bus. Just like its big brother, WING Q allows adjusting bus mixes via single channel sends or MCA (mix control association). MCAs are similar to DCAs and allow to control a group of channel levels by a single control. \n\nWhat’s New: \n\n• Larger touch targets for fader tracks (entire fader)  \n• Improved labeling for layer buttons \n• New label when Bus send is set to subgroup \n• Fader shows channel level in subgroup mode and adjustment is blocked\n \n\nFeatures: \n\n• Select one of the 16 stereo aux buses \n• Lock icon prevents unintentional bus change \n• Mix adjustment based on individual channels or MCAs \n• Name and customize your MCAs the way that makes sense to you \n• All input channel sends feature level, width and pan controls \n• Control the bus master volume, stereo width and panorama \n\n\nRequirements: \n\n• Requires a wireless router connected to the WING Personal Mixing Console \n• WING-Q requires WING console firmware V1.10 or higher"

Most app store metronomes are derived from Apple sample code included with the iOS SDK (Software Development Kit). And regretfully, this code fails to account for all the factors that can cause small inaccuracies to build up over time. MetroTimer, created by a software company that specializes in clock time measurement and regulation, is guaranteed to meet laboratory standards for accurate timekeeping. \n\n\nMetronome Highlights: \n\n● Tested with clock time regulation equipment \n● Practice timer to track your practice sessions \n● Visual indication allows you to \"see\" the beat \n● iPhone LED flash visual feedback support \n● 8 metronome sounds including human voice\n● Background mode, blends with other audio\n● Tap tempo functionality\n\n\nMetronome Pro (in-app purchase) adds these features: \n\n● Custom time signatures\n● Accents and subdivisions\n● Interactive beat editor\n● Presets list"

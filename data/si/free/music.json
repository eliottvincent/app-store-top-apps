      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

Since most iOS devices only have mono microphone capabilities, we strongly suggest to use the integrated AUv3 plug-in (app extension) version instead.

      "label": "An interactive Metronome App , Speed Trainer, and Drum Machine designed by musicians. Metronome Beats is already used worldwide by over 10 million musicians for solo and group music practice, teaching and live concerts. It is also used to keep a steady tempo during running, golf putting practice, dancing, and many other activities.\n\nFEATURES\n- Select any tempo from 1 to 900 beats per minute.\n- Subdivide the beat with up to 16 clicks per beat – so you can practice the timing of your triplets.\n- Don’t know how many beats per minute you need? Then use the tap tempo button to select a tempo.\n- Master your rhythm with the Tempo Trainer\n- Option to keep the metronome playing when you exit allowing you to use it with other apps\n- Set a timer to stop the metronome after a certain number of bars\n- Displays Italian tempo markings – handy if you’re not sure how fast Vivace should be.\n- Choose whether to accent the first beat of the bar.\n- Visual beat indication - mute the sound and use the visualisations to follow the beat.\n- Change the pitch of the sound to make the metronome easier to hear over your instrument.\n- Save your settings as Presets\n- Create songs with different tempo settings\n- Organise your favourite songs in to setlists and play through these in “Live” mode\n- Advanced rhythms including Polyrhythms and Swing\n- Integrated Drum Machine\n\nADJUST THE TEMPO WITH ONE TOUCH\nDesigned with ease of use in mind, Metronome Beats has controls for easily increasing and decreasing the tempo in small increments by one touch of the screen. The visual beat indicators help you to keep track of where you are in the bar and enable you to mute the metronome whilst still monitoring the tempo visually. You can also create your own custom sound settings or simply change the pitch to make Metronome Beats easier to hear over your instrument.\n\nRHYTHM AND TEMPO TRAINING\nMetronome Beats has a tempo trainer to help you master your rhythm. Set the metronome to speed up over time or mute every few bars to test your playing.\n\nOnly need a few bars lead in? Use the timer function to stop Metronome Beats when you want. You can also use Metronome Beats at the same time as other apps, allowing you to read sheet music off your Tablet whilst playing the metronome to check your tempo.\n\nADVANCED RHYTHMS AND INTEGRATED DRUM MACHINE\nThe advanced rhythms section allows you to program in more complex rhythms including polyrhythms and swing. There is also an integrated drum machine. Use this to generate a backing track to practice against, or simply have fun generating different rhythms.\n\nSAVE YOUR SETTINGS AND CREATE SETLISTS AND SONGS\nIn the pro version of Metronome Beats you can save your Settings as Presets to access later. You can use these to create song of varying tempos or generate setlists of songs and play through these one by one – useful for solo and group practice as well as playing live on stage.\n\nCONTACT US\nIf you need any help or have any questions about Metronome Beats you can always contact us at support@stonekick.com."

      "label": "Tingalin is a unique music instrument based on the Albanian lute Çifteli (meaning \"pair of strings\"). \n\nTingalin simulates strumming by shaking your device, as if strumming the real instrument. Each strum up or down plays one chord at a time. Continuously strumming plays back the entire melody.  You can also play back a melody by swiping the bowl on screen or simply pressing the play button.\n\nTingalin is also great for those wishing to learn how to play the real instrument. Simply slow down the tempo and watch where the notes are played on the handle to follow along.\n\nTingalin offers multiple instrument voicings. Each voicing can be tuned to the preferred pitch using the slider control +/- 2 octaves.\n\nThe Çifteli is a wooden instrument with a long thin handle and a pear-shaped sound bowl.  This two string lute looks similar to Setar, Saz and Tambura; however, its sound is unique.  The first string is used to play the notes while the seconds strings acts as a backup harmonic tune.\n\n\"The Tingalin iPhone app simulates this two-stringed instrument with absolute fidelity, going as far as to recreate the wrist-based strumming technique of the ancient Çifteli masters.\"\n~Tech Crunch\n\n\"Before I go to bed I simply must play my Tingalin!\" ~Imogen Heap"

      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

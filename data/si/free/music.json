      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends.

Find high-quality, fully licensed editions all in one place. \n\nWe want to empower musicians and simplify music-making. So we’ve removed the need to buy scores and parts on an individual basis. Join nkoda and you’ll have access to all scores and performance materials. Available online or offline. 100k+ editions whenever, wherever. \n\nWe offer unlimited storage and make collaboration simpler with our sharing and organisation features. \n\nOur library includes editions from Bärenreiter, Boosey & Hawkes, Breitkopf & Härtel, Casa Ricordi, Chester Music & Faber Music. You should be able to find what you need, and if you can’t we’ll do everything we can to source and publish it.\n\nDownload and sign up to see how nkoda can power your music-making. \n\n---\n\n**nkoda subscription information:**\n\nYour subscription will be charged to your credit or debit card through your iTunes account once the free trial ends.\n\nThis will be monthly or annually dependent on your subscription choice. Both subscription options provide access to the unlimited use of our entire library, features, and benefits. These options provide the same service and the only difference is a 20% saving on price when subscribing annually.\n\nIf you cancel your subscription before your trial ends, and re-subscribe after your trial has ended, we won’t be able to offer another full free trial. Your subscription will automatically renew unless you turn off auto-renewal or cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Subscriptions can be managed by the user and auto-renewal can be turned off by going to the user's iTunes account settings after purchase.\n\nFor more information, please see:\n\nEULA - https://www.nkoda.com/legal/end-user-licence-agreement\n\nPrivacy policy - https://www.nkoda.com/legal/privacy-policy"

With the app, you can crank up the volume from the kitchen and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. \n\nIt’s using the powers of technology for good, and ultimately with you in control, better playlists for all. And if apps aren’t your thing, you can still use our products without it. \n\nUsing the app is simple. Just connect your devices, adjust the volume, and get on with your life. You can fiddle with more detailed adjustments if you’re that way inclined, like equalisers and noise control for headphones – everything is there to help create your perfect fit. \n\nOur app supports these products:\nActon III Bluetooth\nStanmore III Bluetooth\nWoburn III Bluetooth\nEmberton II\nWillen\nMotif A.N.C.\nMode II\nMonitor II A.N.C.\nActon II Bluetooth\nStanmore II Bluetooth\nWoburn II Bluetooth"

      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

Each strum up or down plays one chord at a time. Continuously strumming plays back the entire melody.  You can also play back a melody by swiping the bowl on screen or simply pressing the play button.\n\nTingalin is also great for those wishing to learn how to play the real instrument. Simply slow down the tempo and watch where the notes are played on the handle to follow along.\n\nTingalin offers multiple instrument voicings. Each voicing can be tuned to the preferred pitch using the slider control +/- 2 octaves.\n\nThe Çifteli is a wooden instrument with a long thin handle and a pear-shaped sound bowl.  This two string lute looks similar to Setar, Saz and Tambura; however, its sound is unique.  The first string is used to play the notes while the seconds strings acts as a backup harmonic tune.\n\n\"The Tingalin iPhone app simulates this two-stringed instrument with absolute fidelity, going as far as to recreate the wrist-based strumming technique of the ancient Çifteli masters.\"\n~Tech Crunch\n\n\"Before I go to bed I simply must play my Tingalin!\" ~Imogen Heap"

You can also apply Voloco effects like reverb or auto voice tune to the vocals of pre-recorded videos––use Voloco as a voice recorder and changer. This recording app and voice changer lets you import video of a celebrity interview and make them sound like a child or an angry alien. Be creative!\n\nEXTRACT VOCALS\nSeparate vocals from existing songs with vocal remover and create something incredible.Want to hear Elvis with pitch correction? Or make Frank Sinatra sound like a creepy demon? Import a song, separate the vocals with vocal remover, select an effect, and you have an instantly memorable remix. You can even separate and edit vocals from music videos or try using Voloco as a karaoke app by separating vocals with our vocal remover.\n\nEXPORT\nIf you want to finish your mix with another app, that's easy. You can rap or sing over a track, record yourself, and export just your vocals as AAC or WAV for final mixing in your favorite DAW.\n\nTOP TRACKS\nCheck out some of the professional-quality tracks users have made with Voloco in the Top Tracks section of the singing and recording app.\n\nLYRICS PAD\nJot down your lyrics so you have everything you need to make a top track right in the app or belt karaoke with your friends.\n\n50+ EFFECTS\nVoloco features over 50 effects grouped into 12 preset packs. Explore basics like reverb and auto voice tune or transform your voice in the voice recorder and changer.\n\nStarter: Two flavors of auto vocal tune, a rich harmony preset, a monster vocoder, and a clean preset for noise reduction only.\nLOL: Funny effects including vibrato, drunk tune, and vocal fry.\nSpooky: Aliens, demons, ghosts, and more.\nTalkbox: Classic and future electro-funk sounds.\nModern Rap I: Add stereo width, thickness, and heft to your vocals.\nModern Rap II: Extended harmonies and effects that are great for ad-libs.\nP-Tain: Extreme pitch correction plus seventh chords.

      "label": "Have you (or maybe one of your friends) ever wanted to learn to transcribe or play music by ear?\n\nIt is so important for a musician to know what you are hearing. A good musical ear helps when you are composing, improvising, transcribing melodies, or playing with others.\n\nMost likely you have already tried different programs to learn to recognize intervals or even to acquire perfect pitch. However, although such programs develop your ear, but can you actually play any melody you hear as soon as you listen to it?\n\nImagine you could understand music... It is like when somebody is talking to you, you not only hear pleasant sounds, but you recognize words and their meaning.\n\nOne day I came across Alain Benbassat's program called \"Functional Ear Trainer\" and have been using it ever since. It is based on Alain's method to learn to recognize tones.\n\nThe main difference between the Functional Ear Trainer and other methods is that it teaches you to distinguish between tones in the context of a particular musical key. You begin to recognize the role (or function) of each tone in this key, which is incredibly similar to its role in other keys of the same scale.\n\nAnd it is *guaranteed* anyone can gradually develop this skill. It does not matter:\n - who you are - an absolute beginner in music or a virtuoso professional musician;\n - how old you are - a 3 yo kid or a 90+ adult;\n - what musical instrument you play (you don't even have to play one).\n\nThe only requirement is to practice for 10 minutes a day.\n\nI was so excited about this ear trainer that I have developed a mobile app based on the Alain Benbassat method. I hope you will find it useful."

      "label": "Hello, this is Erik the programmer of YouDJ. I am an audio engineer, programming YouDJ for 10 years as a passion project. I don't have any cost that's why all features in this app are unlocked with no subscription or ads!! It is the most honest DJ app on the store for sure. Enjoy! :)\n\nMy mission is to create the most FUN and EASY dj mixer, so even my mother can be a DJ!\n\nTherefore, YouDJ is NOT the most complete DJ app but offers the MUST-HAVE DJ TOOLS. You will see that all the tools are pretty high quality! That's because I am an expert in this field (being an audio engineer). I built advanced technologies to allow everyone to mix like a pro and have fun doing it. It is still usable by advanced DJs but if you need more tools (MIDI controllers...), use a pro DJ app.\n\nIncluded DJ tools : 2 virtual turntables, 16 sound effects such echo/flanger/crusher, sampler with 80 built-in samples, realistic vinyl scratching, auto beat synchronization, keylock, seamless loops, playlist automix, hotcues, 3 bands equalizer, crossfader, low/high pass filter, music visualization (party mode)...\n\nTo finish, you don't need to have music on your device, the app is preloaded with great music from talented artists I personally know. Please support the artists by following them on social medias. You can also play MP3 files stored on your device.\n\nImportant : No DJ app (including YouDJ) will work with Apple Music / Spotify / Youtube Music because these are closed platforms and all their songs are encrypted with DRM. Also there is no legal way to mix popular music without paying on mobile, so don't ask me why there is no Justin Bieber in the provided songs!! ;)\n\nYouDJ is available on all desktop and mobile platforms. You should definitely try at least the computer version too (you.dj).\n\nHoping you will love the app and be prepared to waste lot of time ;)\n\nIf you want to thank me for all my time I put in this app, you can give me a good review, it helps me a lot, thanks!\n\n----------\n\nHOW TO MIX\n\nWhat you got is a traditional DJ setup : 2 turntables and a mixer. Your mission is to play simultaneously two songs on each turntable and to use the mixer to mix them together.\n\nTo spice up your mix, you can use effects such as the loops, the fx pads, the eq, the scratch, the sampler, the hot cues...\n\n----------\n\nAgain, BIG THANKS TO YOU for loving YouDJ, it motivates me to continue the project,\n\nHave fun with YouDJ and take care :)\n\nErik the programmer"

      "label": "Holiday music lovers across the globe are getting an early Christmas gift because of the massively popular Christmas Radio app.\n\nFeaturing a streamlined interface and designed for iPhone and iPad, the app allows you to enjoy a wide variety of Christmas hits from over 180 (during season) unique stations.\n\nSome of this year’s more popular stations include: Mistletoe, Christmas Carols Radio and Kristmas Kountry. There’s also North Pole Radio, which broadcasts directly from the North Pole – a detail that is sure to delight even the most skeptical of Santa-doubting kids; and probably more than a few adults, too.\n\nMore than any other time of year, the holidays are defined by the music that celebrates this season, and that’s why Christmas Radio is so massively popular around the world. At no cost, and conveniently via WiFi and cellular networks , you can instantly connect to the holiday music they love, whether that’s rockin’ Christmas hits, old standards, or whatever else you prefer. \n\nQuite simply, Christmas Radio is holiday music on demand, and it’s completely free. And on top of all of that, the iPad app adds a touch of beautiful holiday décor when it streams music using the Airplay and stands near a fireplace, on a mantelpiece, on top of a table, or even nestled near the Christmas tree!\n\nAbout the optional Remove the Ads subscription:\n- Subscription is for one month or year and will remove the ads during this period\n- Price for the subscription is USD 1.99 / month or USD 9.99 / year\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication\n- Please read our privacy policy: http://blumedialab.com/misc/privacy-policy.htm\n- BluMedialab's Custom EULA applies: http://blumedialab.com/misc/CUSTOM-EULA-BLUMEDIALAB-APPLICATIONS.TXT"

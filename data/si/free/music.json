      "label": "Tingalin is a unique music instrument based on the Albanian lute Çifteli (meaning \"pair of strings\"). \n\nTingalin simulates strumming by shaking your device, as if strumming the real instrument. Each strum up or down plays one chord at a time. Continuously strumming plays back the entire melody.  You can also play back a melody by swiping the bowl on screen or simply pressing the play button.\n\nTingalin is also great for those wishing to learn how to play the real instrument. Simply slow down the tempo and watch where the notes are played on the handle to follow along.\n\nTingalin offers multiple instrument voicings. Each voicing can be tuned to the preferred pitch using the slider control +/- 2 octaves.\n\nThe Çifteli is a wooden instrument with a long thin handle and a pear-shaped sound bowl.  This two string lute looks similar to Setar, Saz and Tambura; however, its sound is unique.  The first string is used to play the notes while the seconds strings acts as a backup harmonic tune.\n\n\"The Tingalin iPhone app simulates this two-stringed instrument with absolute fidelity, going as far as to recreate the wrist-based strumming technique of the ancient Çifteli masters.\"\n~Tech Crunch\n\n\"Before I go to bed I simply must play my Tingalin!\" ~Imogen Heap"

And it’s the easiest way to manage multiple Bluetooth connections. But that’s just the beginning.\n\nSHARE THE MUSIC\nMUSIC SHARE lets you listen together. Now two pairs of Bose® wireless headphones can share the experience - listen together, at the same time, while one of you DJ’s. New PARTY MODE lets you sync two SoundLink® speakers for double the audio…ideal for listening in two different places, and new STEREO MODE immerses you in music by separating the sound into Left and Right channels across two paired speakers for that amazing stereo experience.\n\nGET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR HEADPHONES\nCONTROLLABLE NOISE CANCELLATION on our QC®30 headphones lets you decide how much of the world to let in by adjusting the level of noise cancellation right in the app. And the built-in HEART RATE MONITOR for our SoundSport® Pulse headphones displays your heart rate clearly in the app.\n \nAND SO MUCH MORE\nFrom viewing product details to personalizing settings, get the most out of your Bose wireless products. It even downloads the latest software in the background and only installs it when you’re ready. See how our simple app can make all the difference.\n \n * NOTE * \nBose Connect works with Bose Frames, QC®35, SoundSport® wireless, SoundSport® Pulse wireless, SoundSport® Free wireless, QuietControl™ 30, SoundLink® wireless II, ProFlight® headphones, and SoundWear Companion speaker, SoundLink® Color II, SoundLink® Revolve, SoundLink® Revolve+, SoundLink® Micro, and S1 Pro® speakers   \nSome features may not be available for all products.\nThe Bluetooth® word mark and logos are registered trademarks owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc. and any use of such marks by Bose Corporation is under license.\n\nhttps://www.bose.com/en_us/legal/california_privacy_notice_of_collection.html\n\nhttps://worldwide.bose.com/privacypolicy"

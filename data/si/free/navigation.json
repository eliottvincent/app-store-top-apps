Barvna skala cest ponazarja pretočnost prometa. Deluje tako, da ženski glas voznika v slovenskem jeziku samodejno opozori na dogodek, ki voznika čaka na njegovi poti. Pri tem vozniku ni potrebno gledati v telefon, temveč lahko ostane osredotočen na vožnjo in cesto.\nPoleg obveščanja o dogodkih, vsebuje tudi vpogled v cestne  kamer. Vpogled v cestne kamere omogoča vozniku, da pregleda stanje na slovenskem avtocestnem križu, preden se odpravi na pot.\n \nAplikacija ima tudi tipko SOS. Tipka SOS pošlje sms s koordinatami vozila v klicni center AMZS. Sporočilo omogoča dežurni ekipi AMZS, da obvesti ustrezne intervencijske službe.\nTipka SOS igra zelo pomembno vlogo v primeru, ko udeleženec zaradi šoka ne zna točno opisati svoje lokacije. Tipka SOS zato uporabniku omogoča, da na enostaven način\nz enim SMS sporočilom posreduje svojo točno lokacijo in tako zelo olajša delo intervencijskim službam.\n \nZa točnost prometnih informacij skrbi posebej usposobljena ekipa prometnega servisa Radia 1 in informacijskega centra AMZS, vsak dan, od 6h do 24h.\n \n \n* Pogosta uporaba GPS-a v ozadju lahko hitreje izprazni baterijo.\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

In-App purchase can be used to remove the bottom advertisement and to support us.\n\nThis application does not need an internet connection and works best in outdoors.\n\nBy default, it uses device sensor to determine the elevation from see level, but you also have the option to use NOAA data files to get the altitude of your location. On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address.

This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under \"Settings / Advanced settings\" in iOS 7."

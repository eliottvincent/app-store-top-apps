Pravi prijatelj za poti brez skrbi!\n \nAMZS je brezplačna aplikacija, ki voznike opozarja na radarje, nasproti vozeče voznike, policijske kontrole, prometne nesreče, zastoje, bližine šol in druge dogodke v prometu. Barvna skala cest ponazarja pretočnost prometa. Deluje tako, da ženski glas voznika v slovenskem jeziku samodejno opozori na dogodek, ki voznika čaka na njegovi poti. Pri tem vozniku ni potrebno gledati v telefon, temveč lahko ostane osredotočen na vožnjo in cesto.\nPoleg obveščanja o dogodkih, vsebuje tudi vpogled v cestne  kamer. Vpogled v cestne kamere omogoča vozniku, da pregleda stanje na slovenskem avtocestnem križu, preden se odpravi na pot.\n \nAplikacija ima tudi tipko SOS. Tipka SOS pošlje sms s koordinatami vozila v klicni center AMZS. Sporočilo omogoča dežurni ekipi AMZS, da obvesti ustrezne intervencijske službe.\nTipka SOS igra zelo pomembno vlogo v primeru, ko udeleženec zaradi šoka ne zna točno opisati svoje lokacije. Tipka SOS zato uporabniku omogoča, da na enostaven način\nz enim SMS sporočilom posreduje svojo točno lokacijo in tako zelo olajša delo intervencijskim službam.\n \nZa točnost prometnih informacij skrbi posebej usposobljena ekipa prometnega servisa Radia 1 in informacijskega centra AMZS, vsak dan, od 6h do 24h.\n \n \n* Pogosta uporaba GPS-a v ozadju lahko hitreje izprazni baterijo.\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

In-App purchase can be used to remove the bottom advertisement and to support us.\n\nThis application does not need an internet connection and works best in outdoors.\n\nBy default, it uses device sensor to determine the elevation from see level, but you also have the option to use NOAA data files to get the altitude of your location. On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

The impressions and data you collect on your rides are automatically saved under your rides.\r\n\nSimply use Bluetooth to connect to your motorbike, which is equipped with Connectivity features and a TFT display, and, if available, establish a connection to your communication system. Whether you want a scenic, winding route or the fastest way from A to B, voice commands and the clear TFT display with arrows providing directions will guide you and your motorbike safely to your destination. Using the controls on the handlebar, the navigation, telephone and music features are at your fingertips at all times; you also have a continuous overview of the key data about your ride and your motorbike.\r\n\nKeep other riders up to date on your progress by sharing your routes, riding data and photos at the touch of a button with friends on social media or the Rever app.\r\n\r\nWe continuously develop our app for you – and we hope that you'll stay excited to discover its new functions. \r\nHere, you can find an overview of all the features the BMW Motorrad Connected app currently offers:\r\n\r\n#Route Planning.\r\n•\tPlan and save routes with waypoints\r\n•\tMotorbike-specific navigation with the \"winding route\" criteria\r\n•\tWeather information for your current location\r\n•\tImport and export routes (GPX files)\r\n•\tFree map downloads for offline use\r\n\r\n#Navigation.\r\n•\tMotorbike navigation suitable for every day\r\n•\tTFT display with arrow navigation (voice commands if a communication system is available)\r\n•\tLane recommendations\r\n•\tUp-to-date traffic information\r\n•\tSpeed limit display\r\n•\tPoint-of-interest search\r\n\r\n#Route Recording.\r\n•\tRecord travelled routes and vehicle data\r\n•\tAnalyse performance values such as banking angle, acceleration and engine speed\r\n•\tRoute export (GPX files)\r\n•\tShare recorded routes and photos on social media\r\n\r\n#Vehicle Data.\r\n•\tCurrent mileage\r\n•\tFuel level and remaining distance\r\n•\tTyre pressure(with RDC special equipment)\r\n•\tService requirements\r\n\r\nNotes for use.\r\n•\tThis app is part of BMW Motorrad Connectivity and can only actively be used when connected to a vehicle with a TFT display. The connection is established wirelessly between a smartphone, the vehicle and – if available – a communication system via Bluetooth; the app is operated using the multi-controller on the handlebar. We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

But an app, you may rely on in EV situations, makes it easier.\nFrom the very first click of your smart phone icon 'NEXTCHARGE' you will be transported to an easy-to-use ‘charging station finder’\n\nThe clean, readable interface of NEXTCHARGE will make reading and mapping station locations simple. You will notice your app is displayed in 2 views: map or list. This gives you a choice.\n\nUsing ‘map mode’ you can easily find stations within your current area. Zoom-out for more charging station locations. Our grid mapping system decreases your wait time, for stations to load, and ensures mapped stations won’t be missed.\n\nUsing ‘list mode’ you will see that the description and status of the station are neatly displayed. Along with some basic information: time, distance (mi. or Km), and plug types with their corresponding photo.\n\nSelecting a station from the list or a plug icon from the map ultimately yields the same results.\nA station, selected from the list, displays all of the charging stations provided information.\nA plug icon, selected from the map, will display a description box below. Select by touching. \n\nInformation Includes:\n● Provider ● Address ● km/mi ● Logo\n\nClicking the blue information box may display more:\n● Access ● Plug Type ● Energy ● Price ● Contact\n\nInfo box can be dropped or closed by tapping. \n\nIcons provide you access to add photos of a charging station, comment or review. You are able to share station information using the ‘networking’ icon.\n\nThe red icon on the left allows for a direct request to delete or update a station.\n\nBack to map vs list – yield same results:\nBy clicking any listed station you will be provided with the same information.\n\nThe top right icon, once opened, displays all the features of NEXTCHARGE: Settings, basic & contact information.  \n\nSome important features for Electric Vehicle drivers are displayed in an easy to use ‘button’ format. \n\t\n▷ Add Stations enables users to help develop the always growing network of electric charging stations. You may: add or request removal of a station and change or update information.  *To maintain our quality of service, all data is approved before changes are made.*\n▷ Itinerary is an absolutely brilliant aspect for any EV driver. You may plan to take a long journey; mapping ahead of time to avoid any charging issues. Allows personalization for your trip.\n▷ Settings offer what is important to you, customization and convenient service. This includes station’s *real time status* public or private access and connectors.\n▷ Nearest stations is a navigated map of your surrounding locations. May be zoomed in or out for more stations\n▷ Going back to “Search” allows you to specify an exact location and if it does not exist on our map feel free to add a station.\n\n*Real Time Status* is a quick and easy way to see the status of any station. It makes finding your NEXTCHARGE quick and easy. Clicking the “info” button will show you the colour coded legend of the mapped plugs. \n\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Also suited for outdoor professionals.\n\n- Map\n* To use Topo GPS you need to buy a map.\n* Official topographic maps of many countries, including Great Britain (OS Explorer), New Zealand and Australia are available as in-app purchase. \n* Topographic maps are very detailed maps, include height contours and are very suited for outdoor activities.\n* All maps of a certain region can be made offline accessible using the map download screen.\n* Easy switching between maps.\n\n- Routes\n* Recording routes, with pause and restart possibility.\n* Planning routes via route points.\n* Generating routes\n* Editing routes\n* Synchronization with your other devices via iCloud.\n* Searching routes with filters.\n* Routes can be organized into folders.\n\n- Waypoints\n* Easy adding by pressing long on map.\n* Adding waypoints through address or coordinates.\n* Sharing waypoints.\n* Editing waypoints.\n\n- Layers\nLayers contain information that can be added to and removed from the map.\n* Long distance bicycle routes\n* Mountainbike routes\n\n- Coordinates\n* Easy entering coordinates\n* Scanning coordinates\n* Supported coordinate systems:\nWGS84 decimal, WGS84 degree minutes (seconds), UTM, MGRS, and other country specific coordinate systems.\n* Coordinates grid layers\n\n- Intuitive interface\n* Clear menu with most important functions.\n* Different dashboard panels with distance, time, speed, altitude and coordinates.\n* Clear manual at www.topo-gps.com\n\n- Supported file formats:\n* gpx, kml/kmz, geojson (all also zip compressed), WFS, csv\n\n\nIf you are recording a route, the GPS will run in the background. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nRdzl, the company behind Topo GPS, does not obtain in any way the position of the user of Topo GPS. Rdzl does also not obtain the routes recorded by the user, and save the routes planned by the user, unless the route is shared with Topo GPS. We sell our product, not our user data.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.topo-gps.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://www.topo-gps.com/terms-of-use"

      "label": "Find your current elevation, altitude, and height above sea level easily with this altimeter/barometer app.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Elevation Finder ##\n\r\n\r\nThis app helps you observe the elevations of all locations on the surface of the earth by simply touch and move the map around, or input the address/location name. You can also find the elevation of your current location by using online database, built-in GPS, or barometer on your device.\n\r\n\r\n\nElevation data benefits flood prevention, prediction of water levels in rivers, lakes, and seas, etc. Thus, knowing the elevation of places is very crucial if you are looking for a flood-free house, or planning for a hiking trip, and more.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\n## Could-based Altitude Data ##\r\nThe easiest way to find altitude of any location on earth. By simply point on the screen, you can get the elevation data from a coordinate location point. “Range Mode” is available for altitude comparison (by graph and line) of each point between two selected locations. \n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## GPS Altitude Data ##\r\nUse built-in GPS on your device to determine the altitude of your current location. The altitude data of the area you walked-through will be recorded and displayed as a multicolored line on the map. The colors presented on the line indicate different heights. Precision indicators (horizontal resolution and vertical resolution) are displayed on the screen.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Barometric Altitude Data ##\r\nUse built-in barometer on your device to determine the elevation of your current location. You can either measure the elevation from raw barometric data, or relative pressure from sea-level. Like GPS data, the result is displayed as a multicolored line.\n\n\r\n\r\nTo get the most accurate data, it is recommended to adjust the sea level pressure and temperature prior to the measurement, and set the offset or calibration value if necessary. \n\r\n\r\n\n## Standalone Barometer ##\r\nYou can use this app as a standalone barometer.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Air Pressure / Altitude Calculator ##\r\nAtmospheric pressure and/or altitude at your current location are calculated from known altitude, pressure of the location, temperature and/or sea level pressure.\r\n\r\n\n## Support of Coordinate Formats ##\r\nThis app not only displays regular latitude and longitude data, but also supports many coordinate systems such as, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) and more.\r\n\r\n## Export of Data ##\r\nFrom this app, you can export many useful information including timestamp, altitude, pressure, and coordinates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSubscription\n-------------\nElevation - Sea Level Map  is completely free to use with all features. You can subscribe to this application to remove ads and reduce data retrieving delay by 50%.\n\nDevice subscriptions are available in these plan and will renew automatically each month, six months or year, unless cancelled.\n\n(Per month) - $4.49\n(Per six-months) - $25.99\n(Per year) - $48.99\n\nPricing shown is for the United States store. Pricing in other stores will vary.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n\nSubscriptions may be managed by going to your iTunes Account Settings after purchase or by clicking the “Purchase / Manage Subscription. Auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase.\n\nSubscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period\n\nMore information: https://mapnitude.com/elevation\nPrivacy policy: https://mapnitude.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://mapnitude.com/terms-of-service"

Sometimes the calculations are easy, but this toolkit can help when calculations become tedious while out there in the field.\n\nThis geocaching toolkit can help you using the following features:\n\nWaypoint Calculations\n================\n- Conversion of degrees, minutes and seconds to other formats\n- Conversion between WGS84 and UTM coordinates\n- For my Dutch friends the RD coordinates are included\n- Also the Swiss grid is supported\n- Show the entered Latitude/Longitude using the iPhone map application\n- Project a waypoint by specifying distance and bearing\n- Calculate distance and bearing between two waypoints\n- Intersect two lines using two waypoints and bearings\n- Intersect two circles using two waypoints and distances \n\nText Calculations\n=================\n- Calculate the sum of the character values in one or more words\n- Choose between a=1, b=2 etc., the inverse a=26, b=25 etc. or the phonepad abc=2, def=3 etc.\n- Also calculate the sum of all digits of the result\n- Repeat summation of digits until 1 digit remains\n\nHint decryption\n===============\n- Decrypt encrypted hint text to plain text\n\nRoman numbers\n=============\n- Convert between roman numbers and decimal values and vice versa\n\nFor even more functionality, the more comprehensive app iGCT PRO is available in the App Store."

The UTA Stationsfinder app is available in Bulgarian, Danish, German, English, Finnish, French, Italian, Croatian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Czech and Hungarian.\n \nHINTS:\n \nIn order for the app to notify you of the nearest UTA stations, location services must be enabled in your smartphone's settings. In addition, then the GPS reception is active in the background. This can quickly drain the battery. Using the app abroad may incur additional roaming charges if your roaming feature is enabled. However, the UTA app also works in offline mode, provided that acceptance point data has already been downloaded in advance.\n \nMore information about our extensive services can be found at https://www.uta.com.\n \nIf you have questions or criticism, we look forward to receiving an email at: info@uta.com app@uta.com\n \nOur privacy policy can be found here: https://www.uta.com/dataprotectioninformation https://web.uta.com/en/data-protection\n \nLegal notice: https://www.uta.com/www.uta.com/legalnotice https://web.uta.com/en/-2eu/legal-notice"

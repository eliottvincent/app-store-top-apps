      "label": "Preverite, kaj je na poti z ažurnimi, točnimi, jasnimi in dostopnimi prometnimi informacijami. Pravi prijatelj za poti brez skrbi!\n \nAMZS je brezplačna aplikacija, ki voznike opozarja na radarje, nasproti vozeče voznike, policijske kontrole, prometne nesreče, zastoje, bližine šol in druge dogodke v prometu. Barvna skala cest ponazarja pretočnost prometa. Deluje tako, da ženski glas voznika v slovenskem jeziku samodejno opozori na dogodek, ki voznika čaka na njegovi poti. Pri tem vozniku ni potrebno gledati v telefon, temveč lahko ostane osredotočen na vožnjo in cesto.\nPoleg obveščanja o dogodkih, vsebuje tudi vpogled v cestne  kamer. Vpogled v cestne kamere omogoča vozniku, da pregleda stanje na slovenskem avtocestnem križu, preden se odpravi na pot.\n \nAplikacija ima tudi tipko SOS. Tipka SOS pošlje sms s koordinatami vozila v klicni center AMZS. Sporočilo omogoča dežurni ekipi AMZS, da obvesti ustrezne intervencijske službe.\nTipka SOS igra zelo pomembno vlogo v primeru, ko udeleženec zaradi šoka ne zna točno opisati svoje lokacije. Tipka SOS zato uporabniku omogoča, da na enostaven način\nz enim SMS sporočilom posreduje svojo točno lokacijo in tako zelo olajša delo intervencijskim službam.\n \nZa točnost prometnih informacij skrbi posebej usposobljena ekipa prometnega servisa Radia 1 in informacijskega centra AMZS, vsak dan, od 6h do 24h.\n \n \n* Pogosta uporaba GPS-a v ozadju lahko hitreje izprazni baterijo.\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

It's easy and is just one click away. Another unique feature is the intelligent route planning, where the DKV Mobility App automatically calculates the best route with optimal charging stops for long distances.\n\nNeed to find a station quickly?\n\nWith our new home screen, you have instant access to the station closest to you. You can check the price and start navigation right away.\n\nActively managing time windows in which the DKV CARD can be used?\n\nThe activation mode \"on demand\" offers the possibility to activate cards only for the period in which they are used for a transaction. During the rest of the time, the card is inactive, and transactions will be declined. Simply start the 60-minute time window during which fuel can be purchased. After the time has expired, the card is automatically deactivated again.\n\nWhat other benefits does the DKV Mobility App offer?\n\nIf you need immediate assistance, for example in the event of a breakdown or the loss of your card, the app offers direct dialing to connect you to the helpline.\n\nYou can find more information about our range of services at https://www.dkv-mobility.com/en/. \n\nDKV. You drive, we care."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Up to four dash cams can be wirelessly connected with the Dash Cam Auto Sync feature to provide comprehensive coverage around a vehicle, offering various viewpoints recorded by the multiple cameras. The Garmin Drive app can create a “picture-in-picture” video from any two perspectives at the same time, making it easy to review video and also share videos with friends, insurance agencies, or legal authorities.\r\n \r\nGarmin Speak™ and Garmin DriveSmart™ 65 with Amazon Alexa are two Garmin products that bring what you love about Amazon Alexa to your vehicle. Just ask Alexa to hear music, news, and more. Also, enjoy Garmin turn-by-turn navigation. Stream the audio (music and other responses) from your vehicle’s stereo when you connect Garmin Speak to your stereo using Bluetooth® or AUX.\r\n \r\nOlder Bluetooth-capable Garmin navigators are compatible with the Garmin Smartphone Link app, and older Wi-Fi-enabled Garmin dash cams can access video footage through the Garmin VIRB app."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

The SeaHelp operations centre will then promptly contact the skipper of the damaged  boat by phone to get more detailed information and then will initiate the necessary supporting measures. \n\nThis service is aimed at all skippers in the operational area as mentioned above. Nevertheless, SeaHelp would like to point out that, given the case of several simultaneous emergency calls, there will be priority treatment for SeaHelp members. This service, though, on no account, is meant as a replacement for  the conventional emergency alarm scenarios as established in seamanship but, at best, may serve as a supplement. \n \nNo internet link is required for the application of the SeaHelp emergency call function. Although, when using abroad roaming fees might occur, so, please contact your provider for information about the rates for using SMS and telephone services abroad.\n \nPersons seeking help and not being SeaHelp members will be charged the accruing costs as indicated on the pricelist stated on our website under www.sea-help.eu . Please inform yourself before using this application for the first time.\n \nIn case you should find any mistakes within the information contained, we kindly ask you to advise us accordingly via the support sites indicated.\n \nRange of functions:\n• Appeal for help via SMS to the SeaHelp operations centre indicating the coordinates of the actual position of the person seeking help, the mobile phone number for recalls from the SeaHelp operations centre and the SeaHelp membership number guaranteeing priority treatment in the case of several simultaneous requests for help.\n• Possibility of applying via iPhone for a SeaHelp membership, the breakdown service at sea and support point partner of the ADAC for the Croatia region as well as a cooperation partner of the ÖAMTC, the Austrian Sailing Federation and the Austrian Cruiser Federation. \nPlease note: activation of memebership will be made 24 hours after the application and receipt of payment by SeaHelp.\n• Direct access to the SeaHelp website.\n• Free of charge download of the printed edition of the SeaMagazine rehashed for iPhones.     \n \nImportant notice:\nNo liability will be assumed for the correct determination of the GPS coordinates by means of the iPhone as well as for the delivery of the SMS to SeaHelp. \n \nThis information is supplied without liability."

      "label": "PHOTOREALISTIC 3D MAPS FOR BETTER TRIP PLANNING\nThe award-winning outdoor navigation app is the perfect tool for planning your next trip and finding your way around. The unique photo-realistic 3D representation of the mountain landscape allows an intuitive, realistic assessment of the terrain and the requirements. Many practical features help you to plan your next trip. These include GPS tracking, a routing function, GPX import into the 3D map and map download for offline use.\n\n\n\nMAPS FOR SUMMER & WINTER\nThe 3D map summer is based on aerial photos with a resolution of 20 cm and a matchless terrain model with a resolution of 60 cm. For winter we provide a 3D relief map with all ski resorts and high-resolution aerial photos for selected regions.\n\n\n\nQUALITY-CERTED TOURS \nThe app offers hiking, mountain, ski and bike tours exclusively researched by experts from Bergverlag Rother and other partners. For all tours there is an elevation profile, photos and directions. With the GPS function, you can easily follow the marked route while on tour. A highlight is the import of any tours in GPX format or from Komoot into the 3D map.\n\n\n\nSIMPLE AND SAFE ORIENTATION ON THE MOVE\nWith the combination of 3D map, aerial photo and topographical relief map on a scale of 1:25,000, you can perfectly prepare yourself for a trip. With the routing function, you can plan new routes on the 3D map. The GPS tracking function turns your smartphone into a full-fledged navigation device. On tour, your current location is always displayed live on the map. A virtual 360° panorama with information about the surrounding landscape makes it easier for you to find your way around.\n\n\n\nRECORD YOUR OWN TRACKS\nWith the tracking function, you can record your track and display the route covered live on the 3D map. Duration, distance, altitude and speed are continuously determined. With a user account, you can save the recorded tracks in your personal tour cloud, transfer your tracks to other smartphones or tablets and share them with friends.\n\n\n\nMORE SAFETY IN THE MOUNTAINS - OFFLINE MAPS\nThe app offers an unprecedented level of security. In the photo-realistic 3D map you can read the exposure and condition of the terrain and identify danger spots. In bad weather, in fog or at night, you can find your way around as the map depicts the real terrain. Another safety aspect: you can load the maps onto your smartphone for offline use.\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVELY FOR PREMIUM USERS\nWith a PREMIUM subscription, you can record, save, share and transfer your tracks to other devices, save maps offline on your smartphone, import tours in GPX format and from Komoot, and plan tours in 3D. With the subscription we finance the further development of the app and the creation of the 3D maps. The subscription runs through the store and can be canceled at any time.\n\n\n\nFREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION\nWith a test subscription you can use all PREMIUM functions for one week free of charge.\n\n\n\nFor more information visit https://www.realitymaps.app/realitymaps-app/\n\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.realitymaps.app/agb/"

Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

Backup and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

As you work hard, the seed will grow into a healthy tree. Let the tree be your coach and grow yourself with it. You will be amazed by how great you can be.\n\nFOCUS TREES\n\nHave trouble putting down the phone? Flora blocks distracting apps in a pleasant way to help you focus on what’s more important in real life. If you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app while growing a tree, the tree will be killed! But if succeeding, you'll unlock new trees.\n\nDOUBLE EFFICIENCY WITH FRIENDS \n\nThings get even more interesting when you challenge your friends to plant trees together—you will see who kills a tree (ouch). However, if you successfully stay away from your phones together, each of you will win an additional tree from a random friend. You can also chat and share your progress to motivate each other and keep everyone on track.*\n\n* Flora is the original app for multi-user tree planting and delivers the best features that help you and your friends be productive. \n\nTO-DO LIST & WIDGET\n\nFlora is a to-do list, and more. Simply create a to-do item and set a reminder, then you will never forget a thing. Even better, you can tag your trees with a to-do item to easily track the progress towards each of your life goals. No matter if your goal is daily, weekly, or monthly, Flora will help you follow it through and achieve it.\n\nHABIT TRACKER\n\nEnjoy a rewarding daily habit routine. If you grow trees regularly, you will earn yourself a beautiful, vibrant garden. Take a look at it and feel proud of yourself! Each tree records your perseverance and a step towards a healthy life. You can also view the daily, weekly, or monthly statistics of your activities in Flora to find opportunities to improve your time-management and planning skills.\n\nREAL TREES, REAL IMPACT\n\nWhy not plant REAL trees while improving yourself? Flora proudly offers the opt-in Price and Care services that let you plant real trees on the earth if you kill or successfully grow a tree in the app. We partner with tree-planting organizations in Africa and East Asia, such as the Trees.org, to plant fast-growing soil rebuilding trees, fruit trees that diversify incomes and nutrition, and trees that can provide forage and fuel-wood. All these trees help make the earth greener and provide long-term financial aid to families who need it most.\n\nSounds good? Download Flora and join our 2,000,000+ productive users now!"

      "label": "Tiimo is a visual daily planning app that helps you organize your life, stick to your routines, and work towards your personal goals.  \n\nYou can use it at home, in school and at work to support you in doing the things you need to do, in a visual and motivating way! Tiimo leverages the fact that visual information is considerably more effective than written information for many.\n\nTiimo is designed to be inclusive and helpful across neurodiversity, including for Autistic people and/or those with ADHD, and support executive function challenges like planning, organization, time management, and focus. Our features specifically support these areas. \n\n** KEY FEATURES ** \n\n+ A visual timeline supports time management and focus. \n\n+ Visual checklists help you keep track of each point on your list not only by text but also by using colours, emojis or icons. \n\n+ Ongoing reminders (notifications, vibrations and sound) halfway through and at the end of activities increase motivation and help with transitions.\n\n+ Pre-made routines, designed with common activities, that make scheduling faster.\n\n+ Choose between +3000 icons, including unique background colours, emojis, as well as the option to upload your own images.\n\n+ Joint-use function means the app can easily be used between family members, or an adult and a child. \n\n+ With one Tiimo subscription you can create up to five different profiles/schedules.\n\n+ NEW: Calendar integration with iCal (and others if synced), color theme picker, dark mode and flexible activities that you can \"play\", \"pause\" and \"resume\".\n\n** OUR USERS SAY ** \n\n“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.”\n\n“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized.  I have already recommended this app to multiple people/platforms!’’\n\n“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze.

We’re actively working on support also for the other controllers. \n\nUsing Clausius you can:\n- set a day and night temperatre and operating mode;\n- set up to 2 different heating schedules for each heating area in your building;\n- set Party, Eco, Holiday and Heat Once user functions;\n- invite family members and friends to use Clausius;\n- see how much energy you gained from your solar panels and pellet boliers;\n- see pellet levels in your pellet boiler compartment so you never miss loading them before they burn out;\n- see alerts and notifications from your controller;\n- rename heating areas in your building;\n- see temperatures and relay statuses in your heating system. \n\nStarting this fall you will be able to connect with your heating system contractor through the Clausius app. They will be able to solve some issues remotely and help you with troubleshooting. If the issue will not be possible to solve remotely, your heating system contractor will come to you prepared with the right tools and equipment."

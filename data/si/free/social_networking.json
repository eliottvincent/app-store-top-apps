      "label": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nApple Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

The surveys could be commissioned by media outlets, research agencies or the marketing departments of companies – and depending on the questionnaire, would apply either to the general population or only to a specific target group. Each completed survey is rewarded with a number of points, usually depending on the length and complexity of the questionnaire. The points can then be exchanged for cash, vouchers in online or offline partner retailers, magazine subscriptions or charity donations."

      "label": "Tumblr. Pure effervescent enrichment. Old internet energy. Home of the Reblogs. All the art you never knew you needed. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up. \n\nOh, and influencers? Don’t even go here. Every video you find, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate, every waterfall GIF you secretly gaze at in wonder—that’s all you. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Welcome to weird. Make it yours. \n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is. \n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. Tumblr is the home of all things weird and wonderful, funny and fascinating—old-school internet vibes. We’re built a little different, just like everyone else who goes here.\n\nYour dashboard will become the place to see what you want to see: a chronological tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, reblog and add your own take, this is your universe to discover, express, and enjoy. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here.\n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world, F1 fanfic that your mutuals need to see—you have so many options. Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. You can make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. Don’t say we don’t spoil you!\n\nThe reblog starts conversations in which anyone can join. Reblogging creates jokes and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post only for a couple of your friends to engage with? All possible here). No matter who you are, where you are, or what you are (looking at you here, Pikaman), this is your space—with as much freedom or privacy as you need. \n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. Maybe you have a favorite blorbo from your show? There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3, *and* see their OC art on Tumblr, *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? You get the idea: it’s all here. Wait. Frogs. Did we mention the frogs? \n\nIt’s a whole world out here. If the prospect of reblogging, shipping, curating, and fanart feels a little daunting, or you simply require a refresher on how all this works, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart’s content. Or simply drift through the dream you’ve created for yourself—a chronological dashboard curated by you. For you. You hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service"

Skred enables an anonymous, unique and secure connection with each of your contacts. Only the two participants in a call can communicate with each other excluding anyone else.\nWith an interface that is easy to use without impacting the learning experience, Skred enables easy exchange of messages, images, videos, voice calls and video calls.\n\nThe SkredBoard, which is accessible by simply swiping down, allows for generating many identities that are separated from each other for absolute confidentiality. You can also use groups to exchange with several friends at once.\n\nWhen you delete a message on Skred, it also disappears from the mobile phone of your caller.\n\nAll exchanges are encrypted from start to finish, from mobile to mobile. They are not stored on any server. The encryption technologies are open source and based on the work of hackers and hacktivists of the Guardian Project.\n\nSkred originated from the Skyrock Group, which in turn came from the free radio movement in France. It defends freedom of expression on the air and on the internet.\n\nWith Skred, you are free!"

On Livestatus, you can send all types of messages, including texts, photos, emoji status and your drawings straight to your friends’ lock and Home Screen. When your friends see your updates on screens, they can open the widget and send their messages back to your lock& phone screens. Livestatus offers an intimate and innovative way for friends to chat and stay connected with each other.\n\n- Send messages to friends’ lock & Home Screens\nLivestatus is the first app that allows you to ‘pin’ your messages on your friends’ lock & Home Screen via widget. Everything you send in chat, including  texts, photos, emoji status and your doodles, will automatically go to your friends’ lock & Home Screen. Pin your messages so your friends' will never miss them.\n\n- Reply friends’ moments in Picture-in-Picture format!\nResponding to your friends’ moments has never been easier! when you receive a photo from your friends on Home Screen, you can tap the widget and snap a photo to send back to them. You and your friends’ photo will be in the same frame in the picture-in-picture (PIP) format. \n\n- Hundreds of status to spark conversations\nOn Livestatus, you can add an emoji status on your photo. The status shows on friends' Lock Screen while the photo goes to Home Screen. We have a big collection of 100+ emoji status . It’s ok if you don’t know which status to choose, lively can random a status and it will be fun to see how your friends react :)\n\n- Vanish mode available!\nLivestatus added the vanish mode for sharing photos! when you send a photo to your friends, they only have one chance to view it. Once it's viewed, the photo will vanish both from your widget and chat. In this new mode, you can safely send private or timely photos to your friends without worrying about leaving evidence. Even screenshots won't work in vanish mode! \n\nLivestatus is the best way for you and your friends to stay connected, and it will for sure transform the  way you share your life moments. Thank you for having Livestatus on your phone. Should you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at  livestatus.widget@gmail.com"

      "label": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nApple Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Tumblr. Pure effervescent enrichment. Old internet energy. Home of the Reblogs. All the art you never knew you needed. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up. \n\nOh, and influencers? Don’t even go here. Every video you find, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate, every waterfall GIF you secretly gaze at in wonder—that’s all you. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Welcome to weird. Make it yours. \n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is. \n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. Tumblr is the home of all things weird and wonderful, funny and fascinating—old-school internet vibes. We’re built a little different, just like everyone else who goes here.\n\nYour dashboard will become the place to see what you want to see: a chronological tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, reblog and add your own take, this is your universe to discover, express, and enjoy. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here.\n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world, F1 fanfic that your mutuals need to see—you have so many options. Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. You can make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. Don’t say we don’t spoil you!\n\nThe reblog starts conversations in which anyone can join. Reblogging creates jokes and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post only for a couple of your friends to engage with? All possible here). No matter who you are, where you are, or what you are (looking at you here, Pikaman), this is your space—with as much freedom or privacy as you need. \n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. Maybe you have a favorite blorbo from your show? There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3, *and* see their OC art on Tumblr, *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? You get the idea: it’s all here. Wait. Frogs. Did we mention the frogs? \n\nIt’s a whole world out here. If the prospect of reblogging, shipping, curating, and fanart feels a little daunting, or you simply require a refresher on how all this works, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart’s content. Or simply drift through the dream you’ve created for yourself—a chronological dashboard curated by you. For you. You hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service"

      "label": "Start chatting with compatible matches in 30 seconds! We instantly match you with compatible users to help you make friends or find love based on personality types. We use our own personality test, which is inspired by the 16 personalities test, to match people in a meaningful way.\n\nWe are turning the tables on the conventional friend finding and dating app model and adding what's actually needed: A way to be instantly matched with people based on personality types.\n\nThis works in 3 simple steps:\n\n1. You fill out some basic information.\n2. You take our personality test to find out your own personality type.\n3. We instantly connect you with compatible matches in about 30 seconds!\n\nOur personality test is inspired by the 16 personalities test, which uses psychometric testing to classify people into 16 personality types as follows:\n\nINFP - The Idealist\nENFP - The Inspirer\nINTJ - The Strategist\nENTJ - The Commander\nINFJ - The Mystic\nENFJ - The Protagonist\nINTP - The Thinker\nENTP - The Visionary\nISFP - The Adventurer\nESFP - The Entertainer\nISTP - The Craftsman\nESTP - The Dynamo\nISTJ - The Inspector\nESTJ - The Executive\nISFJ - The Nurturer\nESFJ - The Guardian\n\nThe four letters in the 16 personality types above stand for the following:\n\nE: Extrovert\nI: Introvert\nN: Intuitive\nS: Sensing\nT: Thinking\nF: Feeling\nP: Perceiving\nJ: Judging\n\nThe HR departments of more than 75% of Fortune 500 companies use a personality test that is in one way or another a variation of the 16 personalities test. At Ur My Type, we are pioneering the application of the 16 personalities in the context of a friend finding and dating app.\n\nWe have discovered that our app concept is quite appealing to introverted people. Currently, our data shows that 65% of our users are introverts. There might be more extroverts than introverts in society, but on our app the opposite is true! So, if you identify as an introvert, we believe that you will particularly enjoy our app and get to befriend and date like-minded people. \n\nWe are idealists, but we are also realists. We realize that looks have a role to play in a dating app, which is why profile pictures are shown on our users' profiles. However, we refuse to believe that looks are the most important factor in forming meaningful relationships of any kind. Our core philosophy is that personality is the foundation for dating, making friends, and any type of human connection. \n\nWe acknowledge that the personality types defined by the 16 personalities test are mental models and not absolute truths. However, based on the available scientific data, the immense popularity of this personality test, and our own subjective preference (in case you haven't realized already, we are big fans of it), we are convinced that it's the best tool currently available to achieve our mission of making dating and finding friends online more meaningful.\n\nAlthough Ur My Type was initially launched as a dating app, it can also be used to make friends. In fact, our data shows that up to 50% of our users are on the app primarily to make friends. 65% of our users indicate that they are looking for both dating and friendship at the same time. So, whether you are looking to befriend or to date like-minded and compatible people, you have come to the right place!\n\nWe are always communicating with our users to keep improving. So if you have any suggestions, tips, questions, or feature requests, please feel free to send us an email at info@ur-mytype.com.\n\nAvailable worldwide.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Ur My Type.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://urmytype.app/privacy-policy\nTerms and Conditions: https://urmytype.app/terms-and-conditions"

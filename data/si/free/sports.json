      "label": "The APP of Dolomiti Superski is supposed to be a real online ski guide for those who want to discover the world’s largest ski carousel and is supported by all the operating systems of the most common smart phones. It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

We aimed at developing an app as clean and simple to use like your avalanche transceiver.\n\nOFFLINE CAPABILITY\n\nThe only things you should worry about are weather and snow conditions, not if your phone has reception. Thats why SnowSafe does its best to sync the avalanche reports whenever possible.\n\nALERTS\n\nSometimes the conditions can change significantly even within a day. We have you covered and alert you when there is high risk or a new report is issued during the day.\n\nWEATHER\n\nThe weather makes or breaks a trip to the mountains. That is why we included the most reliable mountain weather forecasts we could find.\n\nPremium-Weather is available as a monthly subscription. You can subscribe and pay through your iTunes account.

Checkpoints can now be used multiple times, so Phi or Butterfly loops can be created\n\nYou can set up private or public course. \n\nPrivate if just for you, your friends, a school or club. Public if anyone can take part.\n\nSimple and great fun. It is free to use. Although designed for orienteering it can be used in any situation where you would like to time or score an event, or you simply what to show someone has traveled to a specific location. \n\nFor a fun example, you could use it on a stag night with a barcode at each pub or on a car navigation event to show various points have been visited. \n\nIf you use the app for something unusual then tell us about it as we'd love to hear about it."

The SIGMA RIDE app is an important addition to the SIGMA GPS bike computer and the perfect companion for navigation and for achieving your personal goals! Reach and surpass your training goals. Track your speed, the distance you have travelled, your current and upcoming altitudes, the calories you´ve burned. The SIGMA RIDE app gives you an overview of all of your training, shows you your statistics, and motivates you to pursue a fitter, healthier lifestyle. Share your experiences and successes with friends and family using your social networks.\n\n\nBe there live!\nRecord your bike data with your SIGMA bike computer and analyse them right away with the LIVE screen. Have the computer display your route and current GPS position to you on the map. Distance travelled, training time elapsed, and metres of altitude uphill are also displayed, including an altitude profile. You can set your individual training views easily while you're riding or use one of the preprogrammed views.\n\n\nE-Mobility\nYou ride an e-bike? No problem: the SIGMA RIDE app is e-bike-ready. Your battery level and e-bike assist modes can be displayed on your smartphone. They can also be shown as an easy-to-read heat map, which presents data in colour and offers a better overview.\n\n\nAn eye on everything\nLook at the precise details of every tour in the activity screen. Filter according to sport types and share your activities with your friends and the community via e-mail or on platforms such as Strava, komoot, Training Peaks, Facebook, and Twitter. Record your progress and see where you have improved. Ride data such as speed can be displayed as a heat map. Various coloured fields provide a quick overview of your performance and make it easy to detect outlying values. You can also record weather data and your subjective perception of the ride.\n\n\nOff to an adventure by using track navigation and the Search & Go function\nWith \"Search & Go Navigation\", you can quickly find any location and navigate there. To do this, you can either enter an address in the SIGMA RIDE app on your smartphone or click on any point on the map. Start the created track directly on your bike computer or save it in the SIGMA RIDE app.\nYou can also import tracks from the SIGMA DATA CENTER or from portals such as komoot and Strava via the SIGMA RIDE app. The selected track can be started immediately or it can be saved on the bike computer and cycled offline at a later time.\n\n\nAlways up-to-date: \nFirmware updates for your bike computer are easy with the SIGMA RIDE app, which informs you whenever a new update is available. Then simply follow the instructions on your phone.\n\n\nCompatible devices:\n- SIGMA ROX 11.1 EVO\n- SIGMA ROX 4.0\n- SIGMA ROX 2.0\n- VDO R4 GPS\n- VDO R5 GPS"

Without this connection you will only be able to see a demonstration of its capabilities, it will not allow you to measure the performance of your car.\n\nCollecting GPS data at 20 times per second the VBOX Sport provides a level of accuracy currently unheard of with iPhone and iPad apps.  Our  Performance Test app uses this data to provide you with acceleration, deceleration and VMAX information for your vehicle previously only available to professional Racelogic VBOX users.\n \nYou can quickly and accurately measure your 0-60 acceleration time, turn your test track into a dragstrip and measure your 1/4 mile time and trap speed. Different modes allow you to measure your braking performance and zero to zero times, all using the same VBOX technology used by all the major motor manufacturers and car magazines around the world.\n\nAll of the apps functionality is available when you are connected via Bluetooth to an iOS device running iOS 7.0 or later.  If you are not connected to a VBOX Sport the app will launch in demo mode to allow you to sample the features.\n\nFor more information on the VBOX Sport from Racelogic and to find details of your local dealer please visit www.vboxmotorsport.co.uk"

Record GPS sessions with your phone or Apple Watch, and/or clip on a WOO,  and play the games you love not on the couch, but in the great outdoors, being active. Available games include Kite - Big Air, where riders battle for highest jump, Kite - Freestyle, where landing freestyle tricks with a low kite ups your score, and Kite - Freeride (100% free!), where riders can post GPS session.\n\nEvery game puts your riding on the global stage. Post a session to share, compare, and compete with riders worldwide. Everyone from local first-timers to international pros are posting their sessions, progressing their riding and sharing the stoke. Join the WOO community and see how you stack up on the leaderboards!\n\nThe WOO Sports App is available for iPhone 4S and higher, running iOS 8 and higher.  You can record and post a Freeride GPS session with your Apple Watch, with no WOO sensor or PRO subscription needed - it is 100% free!  To post a Big Air, Big Air Analytics or Freestyle session, a WOO sensor needs to be recording during your session. The WOO 1.0 sensor supports the Kite - Big Air game only, the WOO 2.0 sensor supports all games except Freeride, the WOO 3.0 sensor supports all games except Freeride and includes an integration with your Apple Watch to show live jumps.\n\nOrder your WOO 3.0 at http://shop.woosports.com/\n\nWOO PRO\nWOO PRO is a Membership that expands what’s possible with WOO.

You receive sweet spot run training guidance that will train you to improve your performance and continually build on those gains for weeks, months, and even years at a time.\n\nThrough a combination of advanced sensor technology and an automated training ecosystem, you will be given your personalized & optimal training routine, stride-by-stride guidance during every run, and in-depth insights that help all runners, from beginners to Olympic champions, regularly push their running performance to the next level.\n\nHow to start with Stryd:\n\nNew to Stryd? This app requires the Stryd pod in order to use the app.\nAlready have Stryd? You can sign in with your Stryd account, pair your pod, and get started with the app.\n\nPerfect Pacing During Every Run:\n\nStryd accounts for your speed, slope, run form, fatigue, and wind to deliver perfect, precise, and painless pacing. This is accomplished with the Stryd pod. The pod is filled with motion & environmental sensors that comprehensively determine your running effort in nearly every running condition. With this info, you can evenly pace every run, which means you get the performance enhancing benefits from each training session — without undue fatigue.\n\nSweet Spot Training Every Day:\n\nStryd learns who you are as a runner and then prescribes daily training that is personalized to your current fitness. Next, you can import these workouts on your sportswatch and receive stride-by-stride guidance so you run at the right performance-enhancing intensity from start to finish. You stay in the training sweet spot, where you are perfectly balancing stress and rest, so that you receive the maximal benefits from each session and continue to improve.\n\nAutomated Insights That Keep You Improving:\n\nStryd analyzes and compares your similar training sessions against each other to let you know how your fitness is trending. You will know how much your recent training is paying off if you are moving in the right direction. If there is an opportunity to do better, you can quickly identify if you need to update your routine so you can keep the improvements coming.\n\nContinually Beat Your Race Times:\n\nStryd plans your perfect race for you. Stryd can account for the unique layout of your race course, the weather, the altitude, your skillset, and your overall fitness to prescribe a race plan that will ensure you perform at your peak capability. You will step up to the starting line with confidence knowing that you will run your best race possible.\n\n-----\n\nNote that, Stryd uses GPS in the background to track your running distance and pace, and continued use of GPS running in the background can decrease battery life. Stryd also integrates with the Health app in order to get access to the heart rate data from Apple Watch.\n\nAdditionally, Stryd integrates with Apple Health. This allows Stryd to automatically update your weight, access your heart rate data, and save activity data to your Health app."

It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

Redpoint gives you detailed overview and feedback on your ascents.\n\nUse your Apple Watch or iPhone as a fitness tracker for bouldering and climbing. Contribute your climbing session to closing your daily rings! Workouts are stored in HealthKit and therefore visible in the Health app and Workouts app as well.\n\nAfter each session you will see detailed information about your climbs: the overall height, your heart rate, duration, maximum ascent height, ascending speed, difficulty of routes, and most importantly: Redpoint will give you personalized training suggestions based on that data. How to go from V4 to V5? Or from 5.11b to 5.11c? Redpoint creates a training plan just for you to achieve your next climbing goals.\n\nSo, how does that work?\nThanks to highly advanced machine learning we are able to classify climbing movements right on Apple Watch. In addition to that we use the built-in barometer to measure the ascended altitude. You can track the difficulty of ascended routes right from the Apple Watch.\n\nWorks For:\n- Bouldering\n- Top Rope\n- Sport Climbing\n- Trad Climbing\n- Multi Rope (Alpine)\n- Free Solo\n- Aid Climbing\n- Via Ferrata\n- Ice Climbing\n\nAvailable Redpoint Membership Subscriptions:\nThere are two options available: Three-months membership and annual membership.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\nSubscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nPrivacy and Terms: https://redpoint-app.com/privacy"

In fact we are so dedicated, that we had to build our own App, because we couldn't get the information we needed, when we needed it, while venturing into the backcountry.\nWe built it for us, but we are happy to share it with you - even on a powder day!\n\nREGIONS\n\nCurrently supported regions: Carinthia, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria, Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Bavaria, Slovakia, South-Tyrol, Venetia, Norway, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Iceland, Trentino, Poland.\n\nSMART & SIMPLE DESIGN\n\nFor us simplicity, reliability and efficiency are key on the mountain. We aimed at developing an app as clean and simple to use like your avalanche transceiver.\n\nOFFLINE CAPABILITY\n\nThe only things you should worry about are weather and snow conditions, not if your phone has reception. Thats why SnowSafe does its best to sync the avalanche reports whenever possible.\n\nALERTS\n\nSometimes the conditions can change significantly even within a day. We have you covered and alert you when there is high risk or a new report is issued during the day.\n\nWEATHER\n\nThe weather makes or breaks a trip to the mountains. That is why we included the most reliable mountain weather forecasts we could find.\n\nPremium-Weather is available as a monthly subscription. You can subscribe and pay through your iTunes account. Payment will be charged to iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be be managed by the user and auto-renew may be turned off after purchase by going to the 'Manage Subscription' page in the App Store account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable. The subscription will renew at the same cost.\n\nTerms of service: http://www.snowsafe.at/imprint.html\nPrivacy policy: https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/privacy/view/78acc4869d9b0281251eb6d5aeda973d"

If Footbe’s chance of a win is higher than the one estimated by the bookmaker, the event is considered profitable. Betting on those events leads to long-term profit.\n\nWe developed unique predictive algorithms based on the player rating system. Each player has a rating based on his recent performance, which is calculated using team results and individual characteristics, such as goals, assists, shots, xG, the accuracy of passes, etc.\n\nThe unique Ticket Wizard feature driven by years of statistics and machine learning predictions is a powerful tool that simplifies the betting process for you. Create betting tickets in a couple of steps based on your betting preferences and our predictions.\n\nFinal predictions are based on starting lineups, which are updated automatically before the game kicks off. Once starting lineups are announced, the betting tip changes according to the new and most accurate prediction.\n\nIn the free plan, the app provides analytics and information on all 15 leagues, including:\n\n• Livescore and live match statistics;\n• Comprehensive match preview;\n• Information on injured and suspended players;\n• Starting lineups, both predicted and the confirmed ones;\n• Match result forecast;\n• Best odds;\n\nAdditionally, premium subscription grants you access to extra analytics and value-betting tips. English Premier League includes this information in a free plan.\n\nTerms of Use:\n\nhttps://footbe.net/en/terms-and-conditions\n\nYou can follow us on:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/footbe/\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback at support@footbe.net."

In fact we are so dedicated, that we had to build our own App, because we couldn't get the information we needed, when we needed it, while venturing into the backcountry.\nWe built it for us, but we are happy to share it with you - even on a powder day!\n\nREGIONS\n\nCurrently supported regions: Carinthia, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria, Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Bavaria, Slovakia, South-Tyrol, Venetia, Norway, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Iceland, Trentino, Poland.\n\nSMART & SIMPLE DESIGN\n\nFor us simplicity, reliability and efficiency are key on the mountain. We aimed at developing an app as clean and simple to use like your avalanche transceiver.\n\nOFFLINE CAPABILITY\n\nThe only things you should worry about are weather and snow conditions, not if your phone has reception. Thats why SnowSafe does its best to sync the avalanche reports whenever possible.\n\nALERTS\n\nSometimes the conditions can change significantly even within a day. We have you covered and alert you when there is high risk or a new report is issued during the day.\n\nWEATHER\n\nThe weather makes or breaks a trip to the mountains. That is why we included the most reliable mountain weather forecasts we could find.\n\nPremium-Weather is available as a monthly subscription. You can subscribe and pay through your iTunes account. Payment will be charged to iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be be managed by the user and auto-renew may be turned off after purchase by going to the 'Manage Subscription' page in the App Store account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable. The subscription will renew at the same cost.\n\nTerms of service: http://www.snowsafe.at/imprint.html\nPrivacy policy: https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/privacy/view/78acc4869d9b0281251eb6d5aeda973d"

      "label": "Variometer+ is a very responsive variometer for your iPhone or/and Apple Watch. Works for all activities (paragliding, hang gliding, aviation, ...).\n• Super reactive / responsive\n• Beeps like a real variometer\n• Sink alarm\n• Entirely configurable (settings sync with Watch though iCloud)\n• Choose among several gauges\n• Change units (m/s, ft/min, ...)\n• Customize beeps tresholds\n• Customize gauge max & min values based on your activity\n• ... and more\n\nThis app offers no guarantee, use at your own risk. The creator cannot be held responsible for any issue that might arise. Common sense should prevail. Fly safe!\nThis app respects your privacy and does not collect any data.\n\nFeedback is welcome and appreciated, you can contact me from within the app :-). Please be nice with me ;-).\n\nAbout the algorithm:\nThis variometer is not an ordinary app. To provide this level of responsiveness, a very advanced mathematical technique is being used. This is called ‘Sensor fusion’. It uses data from multiple sensors of your devices, and combines them to increase accuracy and responsiveness. This has been developed in collaboration with researchers from the university of UCLouvain in Belgium.\nBecause of the efficiency, hence complexity, of the algorithm, a great amount of computational power is required. This is why, based on the tests, the advanced level of responsiveness is only available on recent devices. The app still works - but is less responsive - on older devices though.\nEnjoy!"

It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

Checkpoints can now be used multiple times, so Phi or Butterfly loops can be created\n\nYou can set up private or public course. \n\nPrivate if just for you, your friends, a school or club. Public if anyone can take part.\n\nSimple and great fun. It is free to use. Although designed for orienteering it can be used in any situation where you would like to time or score an event, or you simply what to show someone has traveled to a specific location. \n\nFor a fun example, you could use it on a stag night with a barcode at each pub or on a car navigation event to show various points have been visited. \n\nIf you use the app for something unusual then tell us about it as we'd love to hear about it."

Various coloured fields provide a quick overview of your performance and make it easy to detect outlying values. You can also record weather data and your subjective perception of the ride.\n\n\nOff to an adventure by using track navigation and the Search & Go function\nWith \"Search & Go Navigation\", you can quickly find any location and navigate there. To do this, you can either enter an address in the SIGMA RIDE app on your smartphone or click on any point on the map. Start the created track directly on your bike computer or save it in the SIGMA RIDE app.\nYou can also import tracks from the SIGMA DATA CENTER or from portals such as komoot and Strava via the SIGMA RIDE app. The selected track can be started immediately or it can be saved on the bike computer and cycled offline at a later time.\n\n\nAlways up-to-date: \nFirmware updates for your bike computer are easy with the SIGMA RIDE app, which informs you whenever a new update is available. Then simply follow the instructions on your phone.\n\n\nCompatible devices:\n- SIGMA ROX 11.1 EVO\n- SIGMA ROX 4.0\n- SIGMA ROX 2.0\n- VDO R4 GPS\n- VDO R5 GPS"

Your setups are shown in a nice and clear way. A notes field helps you to keep track of additional info, like what weather you created the setup in, and so on. Adjustments for wet conditions are calculated automatically.\n\nAnother feature the MTB Suspension App supports the rider with suggested solutions for problems with the chassis. This helps the rider to continuously improve the setup, while riding.\n\nThe balance feature checks if your setup is balanced between the rear and the front and also gives hints how to improve and balance your suspension setup.\n\nIn addition, the you receive general tips & tricks as well as an explanation of terms for optimizing and maintaining the chassis.\n\nAnother function supports you with suggested solutions for problems with the chassis. In this way you can tune your mtb setup.\n\nThe EASY SETUP GUIDE is part of the MTB suspension app SAGLY guiding you through a base setup by using the SAG. The user inputs the suspension part’s travel and the used travel when standing on the bike. This SAG calculator calculates the SAG based on this inputs and gives hints based on the result.\n\nThe EASY SETUP GUIDE of SAGLY helps you to find an appropriate base setup by giving you recommendations for your tire pressure based on your weight and riding terrain.\n\nEXPLORE SETUPS\n\nExplore setups from other riders in the MTB suspension app SAGLY. Filter and Search by frame, fork, shock or tire-models. Sort by number of high-fives (likes), number of comments, and recently created. The setups of other riders are displayed with all information about the rider and the bikes the setup is created for.\n\nYou can high-five (like) those setups, create comments or even try those setups out and copy them to your setups.\n\nA better suspension setup on your mountain bike means not only more comfort and more safety but also more fun and also faster riding.\n\nWhy SAGLY?\n\nMountain biking is not only a sport, hobby or lifestyle in our opinion. We associate mountain biking with much more. \n\nWhen you ride your mountain bike, you experience the nature, improve your physical and mental health, you get to meet other people, you encounter pleasure and enjoyment, you strengthen your will and sometimes you learn how to get up again. \n\nThose are just a view reasons, why we think it is worth working on an innovative mobile app like SAGLY. SAGLY’S technology helps you not only to document, tune and compare your mountain bike settings, but also to enjoy a really great activity, mountain biking"

      "label": "Ledlenser Connect enables you to remotely control and customize your Ledlenser light with Bluetooth®.  The app allows you to customize your light's settings and create custom profiles with the right light for your applications. Timers allow you to configure when the light will switch on and off. \r\n\nCompatible with MH11/iH11R, Wireless Remote Control Type A and ML6 Connect WL.\r\n\nWireless Remote Control and Direct Control: \r\nRemotely operate your Ledlenser with the Connect app or with the Wireless Remote Control Type A (if compatible). This will help you to have the correct light for any situation, even when your Ledlenser is out of reach, e.g. when hanging in the tent or under the ceiling.  \r\n\nPersonalize your light settings: \r\nUse the app to quickly and easily combine light functions that are suitable for your applications. In up to eight different profiles, you can create and store settings for your activities such as hiking, camping, DIY and working in the dark. Each profile allows you to configure up to six light features, such as light intensity, color, or additional functions such as Optisense (depending on your lamp). After sending the profile to the lamp, these features can then be set directly using the switch of the lamp – even without smartphone.\r\n\nLight at the right time: \r\nThis function allows you to define when the light switches on or off. So you can use the light to wake you up or to have the light switch off after a certain amount of time to save battery power, for example if you fall asleep. You can also choose whether the light should gradually dim as it switches off and gradually become brighter when it switches on - to wake you gently, for example. \r\n\nKeep an eye on time thanks to blinking\r\nSometimes it is important to keep an eye on time - for example during interval training or certain jobs in the dark. It helps not having to look at your watch. You can program your Ledlenser to blink after a certain period (interval) to alert you a specific amount of time has passed. The activated light thereby will be shortly interrupted. E.g. when a 10 minutes interval has been set, the light would be shortly interrupted every 10 minutes. In addition, the smart blink function can indicate the number of intervals which have passed. E.g. at a 10 minutes interval with smart blink, the light would be shortly interrupted one time after 10 minutes, then two times shortly interrupted after 20 minutes (= perceived as two times shortly blinking) and so on.\r\n\r\nBattery Status\r\nWhen connected, the Connect app will show you the current battery status of your Ledlenser in %.\r\n\nSOS function: \r\nIn emergencies, the SOS button emits an international distress signal. In addition, the ML6 Connect WL features the Alpine Distress Signal. This is for instance helpful when you’re without cell phone reception in the mountains and need the mountain patrol. \r\n\nService/FAQs/Troubleshoting:\r\nhttps://www.ledlenser.com/support/\n\n\r\nNEW FUNCTIONS:\r\nThe app contains new functions for a better user experience. New Ledlenser products are compatible with the Ledlenser Connect app."

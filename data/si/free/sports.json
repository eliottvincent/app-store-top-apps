      "label": "The APP of Dolomiti Superski is supposed to be a real online ski guide for those who want to discover the world’s largest ski carousel and is supported by all the operating systems of the most common smart phones. It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

It will start from Alicante, Spain on 15 January 2023, finishing in Genova, Italy early in the summer of 2023.\n\n\nThe race will visit nine iconic cities around the globe over a six-month period and will feature a leg with the longest racing distance in the 50-year history of the event - a 12,750 nautical mile, one-month marathon from Cape Town to Itajaí.\n\n\nDownload the official app to follow the racing live through our tracker, get all the latest news and keep up with the action!"

      "label": "Predictions for World’s Basketball in One Single App\n\nWe provide AI powered betting predictions for various basketball tournaments from the globe, including NBA from USA and EuroLeague from Europe. Our algorithms constantly analyze the performance situation of basketball teams and generate predictions for final game results and total score figures for each game. No human interaction is involved in the generation of predictions, and we solely rely on our algorithms. Algorithms work in a way so that predictions are generated consistently, which is not really feasible when predictions are made by humans. Our AI algorithms look at a large number of features when generating predictions and can learn how each feature may affect the result of a basketball game. Predictions are renewed periodically and past prediction results are openly shared in our application. With out app, you don’t need to spend so much time on game and team stats, basketball props, and game highlights. Basketball Betting Tipster automates the performance analysis work for you so that you can focus on thinking how to use the predictions to develop the best basketball betting strategy to beat the bookies. Whenever possible, we even share reference betting odds for each prediction so that you can even consider odds when using the predictions when developing your basketball betting strategy.\n\nGame Result Predictions\n\nOur AI algorithms generate the likelihood of each basketball team to win the game that will be played. These predictions are probabilistic and shared as a percentage figure for each team. Since there is always a winner in basketball games, the team having a winning probability that is greater than 50% is the expected winner based on our algorithms. Our algorithms expect that a given game is riskier for betting when these probabilities are close to each other (say 48% and 52%). As the winning probability increases and gets closer to 100% for a given team, it indicates a stronger confidence on the prediction for that team to win the game. Whenever it is possible, reference odds are made available as well from bookmakers for each game result prediction.\n\nTotal Score Predictions\n\nBeside game result predictions, we even share total score predictions for each game. It is very challenging to be very accurate on total score predictions so that beside the total score prediction, we even share a prediction interval for the total score itself. For example, if the total score prediction is – say – 180 for a given basketball game, our algorithms also provide an interval i.e. the total score of the game is expected to be between 168 and 192. In this way, you can try to pick the best bet for total score betting for basketball games. Whenever it is possible, reference betting odds are made available for total score predictions as well in our mobile app."

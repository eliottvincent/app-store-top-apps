It supports you in your shooting sport by simply taking pictures of your shooting targets with your cell phone. The targets are automatically evaluated and your shooting images are archived in the digital shooting book. Share your shooting results with other shooters within the app.\n\nTarget evaluation with your cell phone\n\nFor target evaluation, place your ring target on a plain background after shooting and take a picture of your target with the Blackhole app. The app will then evaluate the shots on the target to the 10th of a ring within a few seconds and display the hit image and the values determined for the individual hits. After the evaluation, you can manually add, edit or delete individual hits in the shot image.\nThe App supports ring targets from the shooting associations: \n\nInternational - ISSF; USA - NRA; Great Britain - NSRA; Australia - TRA; Netherlands - KNSA; Denmark - DGI; Germany - DSB, BDS, BDMP, DSU, KYF, BSSB; Switzerland - SSV\n\nWrite us if you miss a target or your federation so we can close the gap.\n\nWizard for recording your target\n\nThe app supports you in taking optimal pictures of your target by using an optical level to help you keep your phone as perpendicular and steady as possible to the target. The camera of your cell phone is then automatically triggered when the target is optimally positioned in the picture.\n\nYour results in the hit image at a glance\n\nLook at your hit image in detail. The hit position and the scattering and the hull circle provide you with information on how to optimally adjust your sight and improve your shooting technique.\n\nGraphical analysis of hit images\n\nTrack your progress in shooting training. Graphs help you compare your shot images and show you trends. So you know you're on the right track.\n\nYour shooting log goes digital\n\nManage your shooting results from anywhere. From now on you always have your shooting book with you and keep track of all your training and competition sessions. In the detailed view you can look at and analyze every single shot in detail.\n\nGet your equipment into the shooting book\n\nInventory your sports weapons, ammunition and other items. Link your inventory with your entries in the shooting book and compare your performance. With which sporting weapon have you shot the best so far? And how does your choice of ammunition affect the spread?\n\nShow your shooting results\n\nShow your friends your best shooting results in the digital Shooters Lounge or post them on your favorite social platform. You can be proud of your shooting achievements.\n\nExport your shooting results as PDF\n\nCreate a shooting log or detailed logs of your events and export the documents as PDF.\n\nExport your training records\n\nHave your shooting instructor sign your shooting results directly on your phone and export your training record directly as a PDF.\n\nShooting results of your friends\n\nSee how your friends shot and with which equipment in the news feed. You can show them your appreciation with a \"thumbs up\".\nYou can compare your shooting results with those of other shooters and compare them in charts."

Your setups are shown in a nice and clear way. A notes field helps you to keep track of additional info, like what weather you created the setup in, and so on. Adjustments for wet conditions are calculated automatically.\n\nAnother feature the MTB Suspension App supports the rider with suggested solutions for problems with the chassis. This helps the rider to continuously improve the setup, while riding.\n\nThe balance feature checks if your setup is balanced between the rear and the front and also gives hints how to improve and balance your suspension setup.\n\nIn addition, the you receive general tips & tricks as well as an explanation of terms for optimizing and maintaining the chassis.\n\nAnother function supports you with suggested solutions for problems with the chassis. In this way you can tune your mtb setup.\n\nThe EASY SETUP GUIDE is part of the MTB suspension app SAGLY guiding you through a base setup by using the SAG. The user inputs the suspension part’s travel and the used travel when standing on the bike. This SAG calculator calculates the SAG based on this inputs and gives hints based on the result.\n\nThe EASY SETUP GUIDE of SAGLY helps you to find an appropriate base setup by giving you recommendations for your tire pressure based on your weight and riding terrain.\n\nEXPLORE SETUPS\n\nExplore setups from other riders in the MTB suspension app SAGLY. Filter and Search by frame, fork, shock or tire-models. Sort by number of high-fives (likes), number of comments, and recently created. The setups of other riders are displayed with all information about the rider and the bikes the setup is created for.\n\nYou can high-five (like) those setups, create comments or even try those setups out and copy them to your setups.\n\nA better suspension setup on your mountain bike means not only more comfort and more safety but also more fun and also faster riding.\n\nWhy SAGLY?\n\nMountain biking is not only a sport, hobby or lifestyle in our opinion. We associate mountain biking with much more. \n\nWhen you ride your mountain bike, you experience the nature, improve your physical and mental health, you get to meet other people, you encounter pleasure and enjoyment, you strengthen your will and sometimes you learn how to get up again. \n\nThose are just a view reasons, why we think it is worth working on an innovative mobile app like SAGLY.

It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

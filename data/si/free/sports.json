The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself!

      "label": "ALL AVALANCHE INFORMATION AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nWe are obsessed about skiing! In fact we are so dedicated, that we had to build our own App, because we couldn't get the information we needed, when we needed it, while venturing into the backcountry.\nWe built it for us, but we are happy to share it with you - even on a powder day!\n\nREGIONS\n\nCurrently supported regions: Carinthia, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria, Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Bavaria, Slovakia, South-Tyrol, Venetia, Norway, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Iceland, Trentino, Poland.\n\nSMART & SIMPLE DESIGN\n\nFor us simplicity, reliability and efficiency are key on the mountain. We aimed at developing an app as clean and simple to use like your avalanche transceiver.\n\nOFFLINE CAPABILITY\n\nThe only things you should worry about are weather and snow conditions, not if your phone has reception. Thats why SnowSafe does its best to sync the avalanche reports whenever possible.\n\nALERTS\n\nSometimes the conditions can change significantly even within a day. We have you covered and alert you when there is high risk or a new report is issued during the day.\n\nWEATHER\n\nThe weather makes or breaks a trip to the mountains. That is why we included the most reliable mountain weather forecasts we could find.\n\nPremium-Weather is available as a monthly subscription. You can subscribe and pay through your iTunes account. Payment will be charged to iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be be managed by the user and auto-renew may be turned off after purchase by going to the 'Manage Subscription' page in the App Store account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable. The subscription will renew at the same cost.\n\nTerms of service: http://www.snowsafe.at/imprint.html\nPrivacy policy: https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/privacy/view/78acc4869d9b0281251eb6d5aeda973d"

From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

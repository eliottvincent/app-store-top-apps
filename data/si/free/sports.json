It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located.

In fact we are so dedicated, that we had to build our own App, because we couldn't get the information we needed, when we needed it, while venturing into the backcountry.\nWe built it for us, but we are happy to share it with you - even on a powder day!\n\nREGIONS\n\nCurrently supported regions: Carinthia, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria, Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Bavaria, Slovakia, South-Tyrol, Venetia, Norway, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Iceland, Trentino, Poland.\n\nSMART & SIMPLE DESIGN\n\nFor us simplicity, reliability and efficiency are key on the mountain. We aimed at developing an app as clean and simple to use like your avalanche transceiver.\n\nOFFLINE CAPABILITY\n\nThe only things you should worry about are weather and snow conditions, not if your phone has reception. Thats why SnowSafe does its best to sync the avalanche reports whenever possible.\n\nALERTS\n\nSometimes the conditions can change significantly even within a day. We have you covered and alert you when there is high risk or a new report is issued during the day.\n\nWEATHER\n\nThe weather makes or breaks a trip to the mountains. That is why we included the most reliable mountain weather forecasts we could find.\n\nPremium-Weather is available as a monthly subscription. You can subscribe and pay through your iTunes account. Payment will be charged to iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be be managed by the user and auto-renew may be turned off after purchase by going to the 'Manage Subscription' page in the App Store account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable. The subscription will renew at the same cost.\n\nTerms of service: http://www.snowsafe.at/imprint.html\nPrivacy policy: https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/privacy/view/78acc4869d9b0281251eb6d5aeda973d"

Record GPS sessions with your phone or Apple Watch, and/or clip on a WOO,  and play the games you love not on the couch, but in the great outdoors, being active. Available games include Kite - Big Air, where riders battle for highest jump, Kite - Freestyle, where landing freestyle tricks with a low kite ups your score, and Kite - Freeride (100% free!), where riders can post GPS session.\n\nEvery game puts your riding on the global stage. Post a session to share, compare, and compete with riders worldwide. Everyone from local first-timers to international pros are posting their sessions, progressing their riding and sharing the stoke. Join the WOO community and see how you stack up on the leaderboards!\n\nThe WOO Sports App is available for iPhone 4S and higher, running iOS 8 and higher.  You can record and post a Freeride GPS session with your Apple Watch, with no WOO sensor or PRO subscription needed - it is 100% free!  To post a Big Air, Big Air Analytics or Freestyle session, a WOO sensor needs to be recording during your session. The WOO 1.0 sensor supports the Kite - Big Air game only, the WOO 2.0 sensor supports all games except Freeride, the WOO 3.0 sensor supports all games except Freeride and includes an integration with your Apple Watch to show live jumps.\n\nOrder your WOO 3.0 at http://shop.woosports.com/\n\nWOO PRO\nWOO PRO is a Membership that expands what’s possible with WOO.

Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote: This app integrates with Health Kit and the Apple Health app."

It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

Club owners can implement both IP and GPS restrictions into games to ensure players do not have an unfair advantage over others. \r\nPPPoker is also proud to report our platform has a cheating detection over 99.8%, and a platform uptime of 99%. \r\n\r\n【Top-Rated Application Shielding】\r\n\r\nThe advanced built-in DDOS protection detects and identifies all kinds of threats automatically while blocking sophisticated attacks to ensure the server is secure and reliable at all times. We aim to provide a secure and steady gaming platform, which includes minimising all risks, including third-party incidents.\r\n\r\n【Disconnection Protection】 \r\n\r\nWe understand that sometimes external connection factors will table issues for our players, which can result in unnecessary downtime and potential loss. To combat the problem, our Disconnection Protection feature gives players extra 'time to act' to secure a stable connection before being sat out at the table.\r\n\r\nFor more information about PPPoker: https://bit.ly/2Vvjb7G \r\n\r\nFollow us on socia media:\r\n\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2XIUyas \r\nInstagram: https://bit.ly/2RHE7HC \r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/3eDrRSi\r\nYoutube: https://bit.ly/2xATnz1"

As well as using QR barcodes to load the course, start, finish and read checkpoints, you can now use your device's GPS to detect your location.\n\niOrienteering allows both score and point to point (linear) courses. Checkpoints can now be used multiple times, so Phi or Butterfly loops can be created\n\nYou can set up private or public course. \n\nPrivate if just for you, your friends, a school or club. Public if anyone can take part.\n\nSimple and great fun. It is free to use. Although designed for orienteering it can be used in any situation where you would like to time or score an event, or you simply what to show someone has traveled to a specific location. \n\nFor a fun example, you could use it on a stag night with a barcode at each pub or on a car navigation event to show various points have been visited. \n\nIf you use the app for something unusual then tell us about it as we'd love to hear about it."

We found that the most important features in a shot timer from the shooter’s perspective are ACCURACY and EASE OF OPERATION. The last thing people want to do at the range is mess around with their timer, but at the same time they want it to work.\n     With that in mind we engineered a shot timer app that has the precision of a high dollar stand-alone unit, with an incredibly user-friendly interface. But we didn’t stop there…\n\n\nOther Features:\n\nAdjustable Start Delay (0-4 seconds).\n\nRandom Start Delay (randomly starts the timer 2-5 seconds after the start button is pressed).\n\nAdjustable Par Time (0-99.99 seconds). \n\nExtra Loud Start Beep, designed to be heard through ear protection.\n\nLarge, easy to read numerical display.\n\nSave shot data to view later.\n\nEmail shot data.\n\nPrint shot data right from your device using AirPrint."

The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes.

In fact we are so dedicated, that we had to build our own App, because we couldn't get the information we needed, when we needed it, while venturing into the backcountry.\nWe built it for us, but we are happy to share it with you - even on a powder day!\n\nREGIONS\n\nCurrently supported regions: Carinthia, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria, Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Bavaria, Slovakia, South-Tyrol, Venetia, Norway, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Iceland, Trentino, Poland.\n\nSMART & SIMPLE DESIGN\n\nFor us simplicity, reliability and efficiency are key on the mountain. We aimed at developing an app as clean and simple to use like your avalanche transceiver.\n\nOFFLINE CAPABILITY\n\nThe only things you should worry about are weather and snow conditions, not if your phone has reception. Thats why SnowSafe does its best to sync the avalanche reports whenever possible.\n\nALERTS\n\nSometimes the conditions can change significantly even within a day. We have you covered and alert you when there is high risk or a new report is issued during the day.\n\nWEATHER\n\nThe weather makes or breaks a trip to the mountains. That is why we included the most reliable mountain weather forecasts we could find.\n\nPremium-Weather is available as a monthly subscription. You can subscribe and pay through your iTunes account. Payment will be charged to iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be be managed by the user and auto-renew may be turned off after purchase by going to the 'Manage Subscription' page in the App Store account settings.

This SAG calculator calculates the SAG based on this inputs and gives hints based on the result.\n\nThe EASY SETUP GUIDE of SAGLY helps you to find an appropriate base setup by giving you recommendations for your tire pressure based on your weight and riding terrain.\n\nEXPLORE SETUPS\n\nExplore setups from other riders in the MTB suspension app SAGLY. Filter and Search by frame, fork, shock or tire-models. Sort by number of high-fives (likes), number of comments, and recently created. The setups of other riders are displayed with all information about the rider and the bikes the setup is created for.\n\nYou can high-five (like) those setups, create comments or even try those setups out and copy them to your setups.\n\nA better suspension setup on your mountain bike means not only more comfort and more safety but also more fun and also faster riding.\n\nWhy SAGLY?\n\nMountain biking is not only a sport, hobby or lifestyle in our opinion. We associate mountain biking with much more. \n\nWhen you ride your mountain bike, you experience the nature, improve your physical and mental health, you get to meet other people, you encounter pleasure and enjoyment, you strengthen your will and sometimes you learn how to get up again. \n\nThose are just a view reasons, why we think it is worth working on an innovative mobile app like SAGLY. SAGLY’S technology helps you not only to document, tune and compare your mountain bike settings, but also to enjoy a really great activity, mountain biking"

We’ve spent two years working with guides, learning about certifications, guiding services, permits and every other detail that is integral to guides’ and clients’ needs.

Currently we are covering the most popular climbing and mountaineering locations in the United States, and looking to expand further into North America, Europe and Asia. We have personally met, climbed and skied with most of the guides who are listed in 57hours, and we can attest to the fact that all of them are true professionals and inspiring people.\n \nFeatures built for guides:\n- Manage your bookings, payments, cancellation policies, refunds and tips\n- Share your availability calendar with your clients\n- Let your clients book you instantly\n \nFeatures built for clients:\n- Get access to your guide’s calendars so that bookings can be done instantly\n- Find great new guides in new locations\n- Control payment, gratuity, meeting details and gear requirements right in the app\n \nP.S. 57 hours is the time from 3:00pm Friday until Sunday midnight.

Checkpoints can now be used multiple times, so Phi or Butterfly loops can be created\n\nYou can set up private or public course. \n\nPrivate if just for you, your friends, a school or club. Public if anyone can take part.\n\nSimple and great fun. It is free to use. Although designed for orienteering it can be used in any situation where you would like to time or score an event, or you simply what to show someone has traveled to a specific location. \n\nFor a fun example, you could use it on a stag night with a barcode at each pub or on a car navigation event to show various points have been visited. \n\nIf you use the app for something unusual then tell us about it as we'd love to hear about it."

      "label": "**Stryd learns what kind of runner you are and adapts to your ever improving fitness to prescribe run training that is personalized and specific to your skill set. You receive sweet spot run training guidance that will train you to improve your performance and continually build on those gains for weeks, months, and even years at a time.\n\nThrough a combination of advanced sensor technology and an automated training ecosystem, you will be given your personalized & optimal training routine, stride-by-stride guidance during every run, and in-depth insights that help all runners, from beginners to Olympic champions, regularly push their running performance to the next level.\n\nHow to start with Stryd:\n\nNew to Stryd? This app requires the Stryd pod in order to use the app.\nAlready have Stryd? You can sign in with your Stryd account, pair your pod, and get started with the app.\n\nPerfect Pacing During Every Run:\n\nStryd accounts for your speed, slope, run form, fatigue, and wind to deliver perfect, precise, and painless pacing. This is accomplished with the Stryd pod. The pod is filled with motion & environmental sensors that comprehensively determine your running effort in nearly every running condition. With this info, you can evenly pace every run, which means you get the performance enhancing benefits from each training session — without undue fatigue.\n\nSweet Spot Training Every Day:\n\nStryd learns who you are as a runner and then prescribes daily training that is personalized to your current fitness. Next, you can import these workouts on your sportswatch and receive stride-by-stride guidance so you run at the right performance-enhancing intensity from start to finish. You stay in the training sweet spot, where you are perfectly balancing stress and rest, so that you receive the maximal benefits from each session and continue to improve.\n\nAutomated Insights That Keep You Improving:\n\nStryd analyzes and compares your similar training sessions against each other to let you know how your fitness is trending. You will know how much your recent training is paying off if you are moving in the right direction. If there is an opportunity to do better, you can quickly identify if you need to update your routine so you can keep the improvements coming.\n\nContinually Beat Your Race Times:\n\nStryd plans your perfect race for you. Stryd can account for the unique layout of your race course, the weather, the altitude, your skillset, and your overall fitness to prescribe a race plan that will ensure you perform at your peak capability. You will step up to the starting line with confidence knowing that you will run your best race possible.\n\n-----\n\nNote that, Stryd uses GPS in the background to track your running distance and pace, and continued use of GPS running in the background can decrease battery life. Stryd also integrates with the Health app in order to get access to the heart rate data from Apple Watch.\n\nAdditionally, Stryd integrates with Apple Health. This allows Stryd to automatically update your weight, access your heart rate data, and save activity data to your Health app."

An interval timer, which is easy to set up and use. It features a nice plain design, with no unnecessary controls. \n\nAdjust Number of Sets, Action and Break duration to your needs and you are ready to go!\n\nOn the iOS an extra switch control allows you to prevent the screen from dimming.\n\nSIT remembers the last 5 configurations you have used. Swipe left across the Settings screen to switch to another configuration.\n\nSIT can run in the background, while you are playing music, watching videos or doing anything else on your iOS device.\n\nSIT Watch features the same simplicity as the iOS app while offering the same functionality, plus it will measure your heartbeat during the workout sessions. The recordings will be available in the Apple's Health app.\n\nSIT Watch runs independently of the phone, so no need to have your phone around during your workouts (although you will need your phone during the very first time you launch SIT watch).\n\nSIT lets you avoid any tedious set up and focus on your training!"

      "label": "Ledlenser Connect enables you to remotely control and customize your Ledlenser light with Bluetooth®.  The app allows you to customize your light's settings and create custom profiles with the right light for your applications. Timers allow you to configure when the light will switch on and off. \r\n\nCompatible with MH11/iH11R, Wireless Remote Control Type A and ML6 Connect WL.\r\n\nWireless Remote Control and Direct Control: \r\nRemotely operate your Ledlenser with the Connect app or with the Wireless Remote Control Type A (if compatible). This will help you to have the correct light for any situation, even when your Ledlenser is out of reach, e.g. when hanging in the tent or under the ceiling.  \r\n\nPersonalize your light settings: \r\nUse the app to quickly and easily combine light functions that are suitable for your applications. In up to eight different profiles, you can create and store settings for your activities such as hiking, camping, DIY and working in the dark. Each profile allows you to configure up to six light features, such as light intensity, color, or additional functions such as Optisense (depending on your lamp). After sending the profile to the lamp, these features can then be set directly using the switch of the lamp – even without smartphone.\r\n\nLight at the right time: \r\nThis function allows you to define when the light switches on or off. So you can use the light to wake you up or to have the light switch off after a certain amount of time to save battery power, for example if you fall asleep. You can also choose whether the light should gradually dim as it switches off and gradually become brighter when it switches on - to wake you gently, for example. \r\n\nKeep an eye on time thanks to blinking\r\nSometimes it is important to keep an eye on time - for example during interval training or certain jobs in the dark. It helps not having to look at your watch. You can program your Ledlenser to blink after a certain period (interval) to alert you a specific amount of time has passed. The activated light thereby will be shortly interrupted. E.g. when a 10 minutes interval has been set, the light would be shortly interrupted every 10 minutes. In addition, the smart blink function can indicate the number of intervals which have passed. E.g. at a 10 minutes interval with smart blink, the light would be shortly interrupted one time after 10 minutes, then two times shortly interrupted after 20 minutes (= perceived as two times shortly blinking) and so on.\r\n\r\nBattery Status\r\nWhen connected, the Connect app will show you the current battery status of your Ledlenser in %.\r\n\nSOS function: \r\nIn emergencies, the SOS button emits an international distress signal. In addition, the ML6 Connect WL features the Alpine Distress Signal. This is for instance helpful when you’re without cell phone reception in the mountains and need the mountain patrol. \r\n\nService/FAQs/Troubleshoting:\r\nhttps://www.ledlenser.com/support/\n\n\r\nNEW FUNCTIONS:\r\nThe app contains new functions for a better user experience. New Ledlenser products are compatible with the Ledlenser Connect app."

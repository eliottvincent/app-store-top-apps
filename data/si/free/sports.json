One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself!

      "label": "Predictions for World’s Basketball in One Single App\n\nWe provide AI powered betting predictions for various basketball tournaments from the globe, including NBA from USA and EuroLeague from Europe. Our algorithms constantly analyze the performance situation of basketball teams and generate predictions for final game results and total score figures for each game. No human interaction is involved in the generation of predictions, and we solely rely on our algorithms. Algorithms work in a way so that predictions are generated consistently, which is not really feasible when predictions are made by humans. Our AI algorithms look at a large number of features when generating predictions and can learn how each feature may affect the result of a basketball game. Predictions are renewed periodically and past prediction results are openly shared in our application. With out app, you don’t need to spend so much time on game and team stats, basketball props, and game highlights. Basketball Betting Tipster automates the performance analysis work for you so that you can focus on thinking how to use the predictions to develop the best basketball betting strategy to beat the bookies. Whenever possible, we even share reference betting odds for each prediction so that you can even consider odds when using the predictions when developing your basketball betting strategy.\n\nGame Result Predictions\n\nOur AI algorithms generate the likelihood of each basketball team to win the game that will be played. These predictions are probabilistic and shared as a percentage figure for each team. Since there is always a winner in basketball games, the team having a winning probability that is greater than 50% is the expected winner based on our algorithms. Our algorithms expect that a given game is riskier for betting when these probabilities are close to each other (say 48% and 52%). As the winning probability increases and gets closer to 100% for a given team, it indicates a stronger confidence on the prediction for that team to win the game. Whenever it is possible, reference odds are made available as well from bookmakers for each game result prediction.\n\nTotal Score Predictions\n\nBeside game result predictions, we even share total score predictions for each game. It is very challenging to be very accurate on total score predictions so that beside the total score prediction, we even share a prediction interval for the total score itself. For example, if the total score prediction is – say – 180 for a given basketball game, our algorithms also provide an interval i.e. the total score of the game is expected to be between 168 and 192. In this way, you can try to pick the best bet for total score betting for basketball games. Whenever it is possible, reference betting odds are made available for total score predictions as well in our mobile app."

The same assistant coaches then had to spend an hour or more compiling those scribbled data into a Box Score which they could analyze further. Basketball Stats PRO app for iPhone scraps both the paper and the grueling process of stats compiling and delivers an easy to use stats tracker, which allows coaches, assistant coaches, scouts, parents or basketball fans to track stats of their team right from their phone.\n\nAll the inputted stats are instantly compiled to show the current stats of your team, this will allow coaching staff to have all the stats updated and ready at any given time during or after the game. Inputting stats is a very easy process, since you have buttons that represent each player in the roster and all the stats categories. You just tap on a player and the stat and it will automatically get added to the game. For two and three point shots (hit or missed) you also tap on the area of the court where the shot was taken from. You can view the complete Box Score with just one tap and send it via email to anyone around the world. \n\nAll the inputted statistics are written to a local database, thus you can view stats of a given player for not just one game, but all the games where the player has been involved in. You will soon realize that this stats app can really help you with efficient stats input and analysis after the game.\n\nApp Features:\n\n** Easy and intuitive way to input stats in the app\n** Compiled stats and box scores ready after each new stat entry\n** Play by Play view, with editing and emailing options\n** Box Score with email sending capabilities\n** Detailed compiled statistics for all players and games where they played\n** Send games to others via email or to other nearby iOS devices with Basketball Stats installed with multipeer connectivity\n** Search for Players and Games\n\nLet Basketball Stats PRO for iPhone take your stats tracking to the next level!\n\nYou can have up to 15 players selected/active for each game (number of inputted players is unlimited)"

      "label": "Perfect companion: The SIGMA RIDE App\nDo you want to be faster, improve your endurance, keep an eye on your stats, or simply enjoy a nice bike tour? The SIGMA RIDE app is an important addition to the SIGMA GPS bike computer and the perfect companion for navigation and for achieving your personal goals! Reach and surpass your training goals. Track your speed, the distance you have travelled, your current and upcoming altitudes, the calories you´ve burned. The SIGMA RIDE app gives you an overview of all of your training, shows you your statistics, and motivates you to pursue a fitter, healthier lifestyle. Share your experiences and successes with friends and family using your social networks.\n\n\nBe there live!\nRecord your bike data with your SIGMA bike computer and analyse them right away with the LIVE screen. Have the computer display your route and current GPS position to you on the map. Distance travelled, training time elapsed, and metres of altitude uphill are also displayed, including an altitude profile. You can set your individual training views easily while you're riding or use one of the preprogrammed views.\n\n\nE-Mobility\nYou ride an e-bike? No problem: the SIGMA RIDE app is e-bike-ready. Your battery level and e-bike assist modes can be displayed on your smartphone. They can also be shown as an easy-to-read heat map, which presents data in colour and offers a better overview.\n\n\nAn eye on everything\nLook at the precise details of every tour in the activity screen. Filter according to sport types and share your activities with your friends and the community via e-mail or on platforms such as Strava, komoot, Training Peaks, Facebook, and Twitter. Record your progress and see where you have improved. Ride data such as speed can be displayed as a heat map. Various coloured fields provide a quick overview of your performance and make it easy to detect outlying values. You can also record weather data and your subjective perception of the ride.\n\n\nOff to an adventure by using track navigation and the Search & Go function\nWith \"Search & Go Navigation\", you can quickly find any location and navigate there. To do this, you can either enter an address in the SIGMA RIDE app on your smartphone or click on any point on the map. Start the created track directly on your bike computer or save it in the SIGMA RIDE app.\nYou can also import tracks from the SIGMA DATA CENTER or from portals such as komoot and Strava via the SIGMA RIDE app. The selected track can be started immediately or it can be saved on the bike computer and cycled offline at a later time.\n\n\nAlways up-to-date: \nFirmware updates for your bike computer are easy with the SIGMA RIDE app, which informs you whenever a new update is available. Then simply follow the instructions on your phone.\n\n\nCompatible devices:\n- SIGMA ROX 11.1 EVO\n- SIGMA ROX 4.0\n- SIGMA ROX 2.0\n- VDO R4 GPS\n- VDO R5 GPS"

Our  Performance Test app uses this data to provide you with acceleration, deceleration and VMAX information for your vehicle previously only available to professional Racelogic VBOX users.\n \nYou can quickly and accurately measure your 0-60 acceleration time, turn your test track into a dragstrip and measure your 1/4 mile time and trap speed.

The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes.

Betting on those events leads to long-term profit.\n\nWe developed unique predictive algorithms based on the player rating system. Each player has a rating based on his recent performance, which is calculated using team results and individual characteristics, such as goals, assists, shots, xG, the accuracy of passes, etc.\n\nThe unique Ticket Wizard feature driven by years of statistics and machine learning predictions is a powerful tool that simplifies the betting process for you. Create betting tickets in a couple of steps based on your betting preferences and our predictions.\n\nFinal predictions are based on starting lineups, which are updated automatically before the game kicks off. Once starting lineups are announced, the betting tip changes according to the new and most accurate prediction.\n\nIn the free plan, the app provides analytics and information on all 15 leagues, including:\n\n• Livescore and live match statistics;\n• Comprehensive match preview;\n• Information on injured and suspended players;\n• Starting lineups, both predicted and the confirmed ones;\n• Match result forecast;\n• Best odds;\n\nAdditionally, premium subscription grants you access to extra analytics and value-betting tips.

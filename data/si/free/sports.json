It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

      "label": "Climbro is a highly efficient training system for improving climbing performance based on 10 years of science research. The mobile app provides real-time feedback on the applied force and hold duration, finger strength and endurance assessment and optimized and easy to follow personal training plans.\n\nPERFORMANCE TEST BATTERY\nThe battery is comprised of 4 tests:\n\n•\tMax Strength - checks your maximal finger strength\n•\tContinuous - checks your forarms anaerobic capacity\n•\tIntermittent - checks your forarms aerobic capacity\n•\tFinger Hang - checks your forarms strength and endurance\n\n The tests provide quantitative measures of finger strength and endurance as well as local muscle aerobic and anaerobic capacity. These measures are transformed into scores and presented as climbing grades for climbers’ convenience. The app presents the test results in a Radar chart so you can easily find out what are your weak and strong points. You can also compare the results of your last two completed test batteries to check your progress. The app provides complete information on how the tests have to be performed and guides you during test execution.\n\nPERSONAL WORKOUT PLANS\nOnce you have completed a performance test battery, you can get automatically a personal training plan that addresses your weaknesses. The training plan consists of 16-24 sessions that are meant to be completed in 2-3 months. The Climbro app provides a handy calendar with the complete schedule of your training plan.  It guides you during each exercise execution providing real-time feedback on the muscle contraction intensity, duration and number of repetitions and rest times. The app also suggests the time to rest between the exercises in a session and between the sessions in a training plan. The Climbro app evaluates how well you have performed each exercise and how well you are following the schedule of the training plan giving you insights of how effective is your training.\n\nSINGLE TESTS\nThe performance tests that comprised the Performance Test Battery can be executed separately, when you want to check only a given physical quality. Additionally there is a Finger RFD test that evaluates the rate of finger foce development.\n\nSINGLE EXERCISES\nThe Climbro app provides 5 predefined exercises with various parameters to improve different physical qualities:\n•\tStrength - develops finger strength\n•\tHypertrophy - stimulates muscle growth and improves strength-endurance\n•\tHigh Intensity Endurance - improves high intensity endurance and oxygen extraction\n•\tMedium Intensity Endurance - maximizes oxygen use and improves endurance\n•\tLow Intensity Endurance - stimulates oxygen use and improves recovery\n\nThese are meant for more experienced climbers who would like to follow their own training plan and know which physical quality would be best for them to improve.\n\nPERFORMANCE ANALYTICS\nThe \"Performance Analytics\" screen provides graphical information about your performance over time. It shows the aggregated weekly best results for the selected tests, period and source of execution.\n\nTRAINING ANALYTICS\nThe “Training Analytics” screen provides various summary information about the exercises performed for a given period presented in several handy charts.\n\nLOGS\nThe Climbro app stores all test and exercise results in the Cloud so you don’t need to worry when you change your mobile device. \n\nPlease note that this app works only with Climbro hangboard. You can use the app with your own Climbro hangboard and any other you can find at your friend's place or the nearest climbing gym. \n\nThe Terms of Use of the app can be found here - https://climbro.com/terms-and-conditions/."

Timers allow you to configure when the light will switch on and off. \r\n\nCompatible with MH11/iH11R, Wireless Remote Control Type A and ML6 Connect WL.\r\n\nWireless Remote Control and Direct Control: \r\nRemotely operate your Ledlenser with the Connect app or with the Wireless Remote Control Type A (if compatible). This will help you to have the correct light for any situation, even when your Ledlenser is out of reach, e.g. when hanging in the tent or under the ceiling.  \r\n\nPersonalize your light settings: \r\nUse the app to quickly and easily combine light functions that are suitable for your applications. In up to eight different profiles, you can create and store settings for your activities such as hiking, camping, DIY and working in the dark. Each profile allows you to configure up to six light features, such as light intensity, color, or additional functions such as Optisense (depending on your lamp). After sending the profile to the lamp, these features can then be set directly using the switch of the lamp – even without smartphone.\r\n\nLight at the right time: \r\nThis function allows you to define when the light switches on or off. So you can use the light to wake you up or to have the light switch off after a certain amount of time to save battery power, for example if you fall asleep. You can also choose whether the light should gradually dim as it switches off and gradually become brighter when it switches on - to wake you gently, for example. \r\n\nKeep an eye on time thanks to blinking\r\nSometimes it is important to keep an eye on time - for example during interval training or certain jobs in the dark. It helps not having to look at your watch. You can program your Ledlenser to blink after a certain period (interval) to alert you a specific amount of time has passed. The activated light thereby will be shortly interrupted. E.g. when a 10 minutes interval has been set, the light would be shortly interrupted every 10 minutes. In addition, the smart blink function can indicate the number of intervals which have passed. E.g. at a 10 minutes interval with smart blink, the light would be shortly interrupted one time after 10 minutes, then two times shortly interrupted after 20 minutes (= perceived as two times shortly blinking) and so on.\r\n\r\nBattery Status\r\nWhen connected, the Connect app will show you the current battery status of your Ledlenser in %.\r\n\nSOS function: \r\nIn emergencies, the SOS button emits an international distress signal. In addition, the ML6 Connect WL features the Alpine Distress Signal. This is for instance helpful when you’re without cell phone reception in the mountains and need the mountain patrol. \r\n\nService/FAQs/Troubleshoting:\r\nhttps://www.ledlenser.com/support/\n\n\r\nNEW FUNCTIONS:\r\nThe app contains new functions for a better user experience. New Ledlenser products are compatible with the Ledlenser Connect app."

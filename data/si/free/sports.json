The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes.

In this way you can tune your mtb setup.\n\nThe EASY SETUP GUIDE is part of the MTB suspension app SAGLY guiding you through a base setup by using the SAG. The user inputs the suspension part’s travel and the used travel when standing on the bike.

More detailed settings are also available. Make settings as per your choice by referring to the setup guide!\n\nWant to check the recorded usage information such as speed, throttle opening, engine speed, fuel consumption?\n⇒ You can now use your smartphone as a machine information monitor!\n\nWant to check how much your lap time improves after customizing the machine settings in the app?\n⇒ Measure your times lap-by-lap with the connected button on the machine!\n\n(*1) Depending on the machine, some functions may not be available.\n\n■ Description\n･Mapping\n　There are three setting types:\n　(1) Fuel Injection (FI) and Ignition (IG)\n　　Intuitive and easy adjustment by selecting \"Smooth ⇔ Aggressive\".

NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

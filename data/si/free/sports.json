One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

The recordings will be available in the Apple's Health app.\n\nSIT Watch runs independently of the phone, so no need to have your phone around during your workouts (although you will need your phone during the very first time you launch SIT watch).\n\nSIT lets you avoid any tedious set up and focus on your training!"

      "label": "Ledlenser Connect enables you to remotely control and customize your Ledlenser light with Bluetooth®.  The app allows you to customize your light's settings and create custom profiles with the right light for your applications. Timers allow you to configure when the light will switch on and off. \r\n\nCompatible with MH11/iH11R, Wireless Remote Control Type A and ML6 Connect WL.\r\n\nWireless Remote Control and Direct Control: \r\nRemotely operate your Ledlenser with the Connect app or with the Wireless Remote Control Type A (if compatible). This will help you to have the correct light for any situation, even when your Ledlenser is out of reach, e.g. when hanging in the tent or under the ceiling.  \r\n\nPersonalize your light settings: \r\nUse the app to quickly and easily combine light functions that are suitable for your applications. In up to eight different profiles, you can create and store settings for your activities such as hiking, camping, DIY and working in the dark. Each profile allows you to configure up to six light features, such as light intensity, color, or additional functions such as Optisense (depending on your lamp). After sending the profile to the lamp, these features can then be set directly using the switch of the lamp – even without smartphone.\r\n\nLight at the right time: \r\nThis function allows you to define when the light switches on or off. So you can use the light to wake you up or to have the light switch off after a certain amount of time to save battery power, for example if you fall asleep. You can also choose whether the light should gradually dim as it switches off and gradually become brighter when it switches on - to wake you gently, for example. \r\n\nKeep an eye on time thanks to blinking\r\nSometimes it is important to keep an eye on time - for example during interval training or certain jobs in the dark. It helps not having to look at your watch. You can program your Ledlenser to blink after a certain period (interval) to alert you a specific amount of time has passed. The activated light thereby will be shortly interrupted. E.g. when a 10 minutes interval has been set, the light would be shortly interrupted every 10 minutes. In addition, the smart blink function can indicate the number of intervals which have passed. E.g. at a 10 minutes interval with smart blink, the light would be shortly interrupted one time after 10 minutes, then two times shortly interrupted after 20 minutes (= perceived as two times shortly blinking) and so on.\r\n\r\nBattery Status\r\nWhen connected, the Connect app will show you the current battery status of your Ledlenser in %.\r\n\nSOS function: \r\nIn emergencies, the SOS button emits an international distress signal. In addition, the ML6 Connect WL features the Alpine Distress Signal. This is for instance helpful when you’re without cell phone reception in the mountains and need the mountain patrol. \r\n\nService/FAQs/Troubleshoting:\r\nhttps://www.ledlenser.com/support/\n\n\r\nNEW FUNCTIONS:\r\nThe app contains new functions for a better user experience. New Ledlenser products are compatible with the Ledlenser Connect app."

Therefore offering multiple choices of current scores (HT Game State).\n\nFurther explanations and how to use it: \n\nYou can quickly find out how both teams performed in the second halves in given circumstances: \nChelsea vs Liverpool \n0-0 HT Game State & Over 1.5 Goals FT\n\nThe SHK app will show you detailed stats for the following: \n- Last 10 Chelsea's matches when 0-0 at HT -> % of O1.5 FT\n- Last 8 Home matches of Chelsea when 0-0 at HT -> % of O1.5 FT\n- Last 5 Chelsea's matches when 0-0 at HT -> % of O1.5 FT\n- Last 10 Liverpool's matches when 0-0 at HT -> % of O1.5 FT\n- Last 8 Away matches of Liverpool when 0-0 at HT -> % of O1.5 FT\n- Last 5 Liverpool's matches when 0-0 at HT -> % of O1.5 FT\n\nFurthermore, we provide stats from that HT Game State in recent matches against similar opponents (where available). \n\nYou can see detailed stats and H2H statistics for those Game States for every match. \n\nThe matches are shown in 2 tabs: \n\n- Today's matches (all matches from today)\n- In-play matches (limited to the chosen HT Game State criteria)\n\nFinally, all matches are sorted by the highest historical % and you can filter them by team names, leagues and countries. \n\nIf you look for Over 0.5 second-half goals when 0-0 at HT, simply choose Lay Current HT Score.\n\nLastly, click on the In-play matches tab to see all current live matches and current Game State scenarios."

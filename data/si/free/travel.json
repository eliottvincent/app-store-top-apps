Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others.

Add a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and never worry about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM-compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM for whatever local carriers exist in the country you’re currently in, but without this old-school plastic SIM card you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIM is a true technological revolution and we bring it right into your eSIM compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or pay for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your own phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store for your convenience. Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find an updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link: https://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to get connected during their travels - it doesn't matter whether you're a seafarer, flight crew, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries -  We are here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more enormous roaming data fees\n* Installation in 2 minutes or less\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your number as you travel\n* No more fumbling to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky Wi-Fi dongle around\n\nHow does it work?\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM You can install your eSIM directly or by scanning a QR code or manually inserting an activation code provided. You can also manage and top-up your eSIMs with your Airalo account.\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fragile, tiny hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things easier for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees. \n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

The map shows both domestic and international flights.\n- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.\n- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.\n- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).\n- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.\n- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.\n\nBy the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:\n\n- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.\n- Guided and self-guided tours.\n- Cars and transfers to get from the airport to the hotel. And wherever else you want to go\n\nDownload the WayAway app now to start traveling and buy tickets.\n\n*** The application from WayAway.com allows you to find the lowest possible cost of an air ticket.

Please remember that continual use of your GPS can dramatically deplete your battery. Be sure to pack a car charger for your tour.  \n\nIPAD NOTICE\nYou can use an iPad to take the tour, however, wifi-only iPads without GPS capability will not work. \n\nABOUT SHAKA GUIDE\nAt Shaka Guide our goal is to connect people with places. We love Hawaii. Not just for its beauty, but also for its rich history and culture. We believe that every destination has a story and we want to tell it. In Hawaii, we have over 20 audio tours that do just that — share the stories of the islands."

Save hundreds of dollars compared to other travel sites.\n\nDiscover extraordinary travel deals, set fare alerts, and uncover great hotel rates.\n\nWe’re so good, United Airlines actually sued us for it!\n\n• Find flights other search engines won’t show you -- including HIDDEN-CITY flights and arbitrary round-trips\n• Filter flights by duration, number of layovers, takeoff/landing time and more\n• Our powerful search engine pulls in the best deals to save you from having to google flights and check multiple sites\n• Monitor prices for trips you have in the hopper and let us alert you when the best deal is available\n• Book hotels as well, including last-minute hotels and special deals\n• Filter hotels, read reviews and view traveler ratings\n• We now offer car rental as well, so you can use one app as your complete trip planner\n• Our new Stories feature lets you book activities for your vacation - take a brewery tour, rent a kayak, or buy tickets in advance and get your guide to museums and exhibits\n\nThe fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

      "label": "Just buy one of our eSIM travel mobile data packs at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) for over 190+ countries and regions globally to enjoy global connectivity. Add a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and never worry about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM-compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM for whatever local carriers exist in the country you’re currently in, but without this old-school plastic SIM card you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIM is a true technological revolution and we bring it right into your eSIM compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or pay for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your own phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store for your convenience. Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find an updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link: https://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to get connected during their travels - it doesn't matter whether you're a seafarer, flight crew, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries -  We are here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more enormous roaming data fees\n* Installation in 2 minutes or less\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your number as you travel\n* No more fumbling to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky Wi-Fi dongle around\n\nHow does it work?\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM You can install your eSIM directly or by scanning a QR code or manually inserting an activation code provided. You can also manage and top-up your eSIMs with your Airalo account.\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fragile, tiny hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things easier for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees. \n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

This also applies if you want to have the nearest stop displayed in the timetable. \n \nCalendar and e-mail \nYou can save connections in your own calendar and send them by e-mail (to friends, an external calendar). SBB Mobile requires read and write permissions to be able to import your desired connection into the calendar. \n \nAccess to the camera \nSBB Mobile requires access to your camera to take pictures directly in the app for your personalised touch timetable.  \n\nInternet access \nSBB Mobile requires internet access to search the timetable as well as for ticket purchases. \n \nMemory \nTo support offline functions, e.g. station/stop list, connections (history) and purchased tickets, SBB Mobile requires access to your device’s memory (saving app-specific settings)."

      "label": "Experience the magic of GPS audio walks, cycles, drives and even boat rides with VoiceMap tours in over 300 destinations worldwide. They’re like podcasts that move with you, to tell stories about what you’re seeing right now. \n\nVoiceMap’s tours are produced by insightful local storytellers, including journalists, filmmakers, novelists, podcasters, and tour guides. Sir Ian McKellen has even created a tour. It's around London's West End, where he has performed for over 50 years.  \n\nFeatures:  \n\n◆ VoiceMap works offline. After you download a tour, the audio will be available offline along with an offline map.\n\n◆ With GPS autoplay, you can focus on your surroundings, not the screen. Tap on Start, and let VoiceMap guide you. \n\n◆ If you do go off in the wrong direction, VoiceMap plays an audio alert, and you can follow the map on your screen to the next location.\n\n◆ Listen to tours as many times as you like both in the destination and in virtual tour mode at home  \n\n◆ With nearly 1,000 free and paid tours, VoiceMap offers huge variety\n\nReviews and Testimonials:\n\n\"High-quality self-guided walking tours...Narrated by local experts, they provide insight into corners of the city sometimes overlooked by regular guided tours.\"\nLonely Planet\n\n“We may be biased, but could there be anything more helpful than having a journalist in your pocket when touring a new city? How about a historian, a novelist or just a really passionate local? VoiceMap culls city-specific stories from them all and fits them neatly into walking tours.” \nNew York Times\n\n“Great value for money, interesting and very clear and easy to follow! I learnt lots about London I didn't already know and I have lived here over 30 years.” \nCarmella V.\nLondon’s Alternative History Tour \n\n\"I loved the tour, bought all of the New Orleans ones you had and have already recommended it to two people. As an amateur photographer who likes to take his time it was great. I will without a doubt continue to use the app.\"\nJeremy L\nFaith & Courage: Metairie Cemetery Stories, New Orleans\n\n“Loved this! Real eye opener for me as a new resident of Singapore who thought this only an island of foodies and engineers. LOL! Please produce more soon!”\nCraig DeLarge \nArtoholic Singapore\n\n“I did my first VoiceMap tour and the Chanel tour blew me away. I can only recommend.”\nChristelle Colman\nCoco Chanel's Paris\n\n\"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this 'talk and walk'. A real eye opener and superbly narrated. This is a first class experience, our first with VoiceMap, and we look forward to using this program frequently in other cities. \"\nKeith F\nWitches Riots and the Cold War, Berlin\n\n** Just so you know, GPS runs in the background while you're on a tour. This decreases battery life and it's best to start a tour with your device fully charged."

      "label": "TrackMyTour lets you track, share, and relive your travel adventures.\n\n**HOW IT WORKS**\n\nTrackMyTour is a simple travel blogging app. Each blog entry (or \"waypoint\") consists of a date, time, and location. Waypoints can also include text and photos.\n\nThe app creates an interactive map of your waypoints, which you can share with your family and friends. They can follow along with the app or with a web browser on any device.\n\n**SHARE WITH FAMILY & FRIENDS**\n\nEach map has a secret link, which you can share with your family and friends. They can visit the link at anytime to see your updates and a map of your journey. The can also register and follow with the app, leave comments, react to your waypoints, and receive notifications when you post an update.\n\nVisit https://trackmytour.com/explore/ to see examples of some presently ongoing tours.\n\n**FREEMIUM & PLUS VERSIONS**\n\nThe Freemium version of TrackMyTour provides everything you need to track your tour. For many it might be enough.\n\nTrackMyTour Plus is a subscription-based upgrade for users who like the app and want a little more. It unlocks some additional features not found in the Freemium version.\n\n**CREATE A BOOK**\n\nAfter your journey you can create and order a photo book consisting of your locations, photos, and captions (needs a laptop or desktop computer). TrackMyTour Books does the heavy lifting of laying out the content, and gives you the tools to fine tune the book to your liking.\n\n**FEATURES**\n\nTrackMyTour is not a real-time tracker, which saves battery power and keeps roaming costs at a minimum. Waypoints can also be saved offline when a network connection is not available, and submitted later when you're back online (e.g., hotel WiFi).\n\nGive it a try and happy touring!\n\nEnd-User License Agreement: https://trackmytour.com/eula\nTerms & Conditions: https://trackmytour.com/terms\nData privacy notice: https://trackmytour.com/privacy"

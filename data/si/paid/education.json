Ves čas aplikacije otroci poslušajo in gledajo posamezne črke in se ob tem prav prijetno zabavajo.\n\nNOVO\nZdaj smo aplikaciji dodali še možnost izbire malih ali velikih tiskanih črk.\n\nAplikacijo Moja abeceda sestavljajo štirje sklopi in sicer: hitri abc, igra s črkami, preizkus znanja in sestavi besedo.\n\nHiti abc omogoča enostavni pregled abecede - otroci pritiskajo posamezne črke in poslušajo kako se glasijo. Z vključitvijo razširjene možnosti pa se ob pritisku na posamezno črko pojavi še fotografija ključne besede z zvočno izgovorjavo izbrane črke in besede, ki jo prikazuje slika (primer: B BALON).\n\nIgra s črkami nudi otrokom petindvajset različnih iger s pomočjo katerih spoznavajo črke. Vsaki črki abecede je namenjena svoja igrica, ki temelji na ključni besedi (primer igra za črko Ž: igra spomin in iskanje parov različnih žog, tako da se sestavi beseda ŽOGA). Otroci tako z reševanjem, s sestavljanjem ali z odkrivanjem posameznih igric spoznajo vse črke, ki tvorijo ključne besede.\n\nZabavi in učenju sledi preizkus znanja. Otroci tu najprej zaslišijo zvok posamezne črke, ki se vselej pojavi v povsem naključnem zaporedju. Otroci odgovarjajo tako, da pritisnejo na črko za katero menijo, da je prava. Izgovorjava posameznih črk je resnično posneta zelo kakovostno, kljub temu pa smo dodali še gumb za neomejeno število ponovitev izgovorjave. Preizkus sestavljajo vse črke abecede, na vsakih 5 pravilnih odgovor pa otroci dobijo po 1 zvezdico. Kot se dandanes spodobi pa otroci ob pravilnih odgovorih slišijo še vrsto drugih pohval.\n\nSestavi besedo je igra za otroke, ki črke že dobro poznajo. S to igrico se otroci učijo tvorbe besed. Z izbiro pravih črk v pravilnem zaporedju, se v spodnjem delu ekrana izpiše ključna beseda ( npr. AVTO ). Večje število napak pri izbiri črk prinaša 0 zvezdic, za izbor črk brez napak ali zelo malo pri daljših besedah pa so otroci nagrajeni s 3 zvezdicami. Zvezdice so izpisane tudi v menijski tabeli, tako da starši lahko nadzirajo otrokov napredek.\n\nMoja abeceda zdaj nudi tudi možnost izbire učenja malih ali velikih tiskanih črk.\n\nStaršem se iskreno zahvaljujemo za nakup, otrokom pa želimo kar se da prijeten in zabaven vstop v čudoviti svet črk in besed.\n\nČe vam je aplikacija všeč pa bomo tudi mi zelo veseli odličnih ocen in všečkov.\n\nKONTAKT\nPredloge, pohvale in sporočila o morebitnih napakah v delovanju nam prosim pošljite na info(afna)mojepravljice.si."

You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

Crazy Gears is a new-aged digital puzzle game, designed with a real mechanical engine and with children's critical thinking skills in mind! Hours of fun guaranteed for everyone who is up for the challenge, yes, even you Mom & Dad!\n\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2015 ***\n*** Parent's Choice Gold Winner Fall 2015***\n*** App of the week by Fun2Tap ***\n*** Best of the Best by Best Apps For Kids ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n\n\nABOUT CRAZY GEARS\nExplore a captivating digital playground in this tantalizing puzzle game! Children manipulate gears, chains, rods, and pulleys, to pull themselves through each level, which teaches them how different mechanisms affect one another when constructing a machine. Each reasoning challenge was carefully designed to adhere to the theories of educational technology pioneer, mathematician, computer scientist, and designer of the first programming language for children, Seymour Papert.\n\n“The best use of games is to leverage their tendency to enhance learning”- Papert\nRecommended Ages 5-9 \n\nAs a child, Papert fell in love with gears. Their movement fascinated him in every way and inspired his career. Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

      "label": "This guided meditation digital recording and book from New York Times best-selling authors Esther and Jerry Hicks explains  how \"getting into the vortex\" is essential for manifestation using the Law of Attraction. Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

Kids explore and play with the geological forces that change the Earth—above and below the surface, in minutes and over millions of years. Kids can also learn about conservation as they test clean energy sources, clean up beaches, and preserve forests.\n\nThe Earth is No. 5 in Tinybop’s Explorer’s Library. Each Explorer’s Library app lets kids explore the invisible and awesome wonders of STEM. Kids (and kids at heart!) develop foundational science literacy. \n\n\"This is a great way to let children informally and playfully discover some of the big ideas they’ll encounter later on in their school curriculum. Apps like this one are good reminders for why you spent hundreds of dollars on a phone or tablet for your child.\" — Warren Buckleitner, editor, Children's Technology Review\n\nFeatures: \n     * Investigate how landforms are created.\n     * See the Earth transform over time, from a sphere of boiling rock to the continents we live on today.\n     * Dig under the surface and observe the Earth’s layers from the crust to core.\n     * Weather, erode, and deposit rocks and sediment. Shape the land with your fingertips!\n     * Make a river meander. Make a glacier recede and advance. Create sand dunes, sea stacks, and beaches. Trigger a rockslide!\n     * Discover fossils as you investigate rock formations.\n     * See how plants weather the Earth by making your own garden. \n     * Discover mysteries like frost wedging, stalactites and stalagmites, and hotspots.\n     * Experiment with four different types of volcanoes.\n     * Earth Day ecology bonus interactions about conservation: test clean energy sources, clean up beaches, and preserve forests.\n     * Learn new vocabulary in 40+ languages with interactive labels in close-up scenes.  \n     * Original artwork by Sarah Jacoby.\n     * Intuitive, safe, and kid-friendly design.\n     * Entertaining for kids and adults alike — play together and learn together!\n\nFREE handbook\nOur expert-reviewed handbook is full of facts, interaction tips, and discussion questions to support learning in this app, in the classroom or at home.

It has LESS FEATURES than the iPad app. (it has NO LATERAL computations, no graphical MCP and Max Continuous Power computations and a simple version load manifest) For use on iPad with professional load manifest, exact lateral and MCP performance computations, please choose the Tim Tucker - iPad version.  *********\n\n\nA great new tool for students, instructors and professional pilots. Weight & Balance calculations have never been easier and faster. \n\n\nWith the Gyronimo Performance Pad you can calculate weight & balance, performance and navigation data in just a few seconds!  It is designed specifically for the Robinson R44 Raven and Raven II, and contains all necessary flight and performance data. \n\nThe weight and balance calculations can also be used for the Robinson R44 Astro.\n\nQuickly change all important values using sliders! Compare Raven and  Raven II OGE and IGE performance! \nCalculate and compare Manifold Pressure and Never Exceed Speed Limits.\nThis enables students and flight instructors to experiment with the values and create \"what if\" scenarios in no time.\n\nThe Performance Pad has four main pages\n\n1. Weight and Balance Page\nSet person and baggage values in seconds using the convenient sliders. Select doors on/off with switch-buttons. The CG position is calculated and displayed simultaneously.\n\nBased on fuel flow and fuel available the flight time and fuel reserve are computed. Control all values via sliders and receive a warning if the fuel reserve is less than 20 minutes.\n\n\n2. Performance Page\nUsing the data from your Weight & Balance page the pad calculates:\n- Out of Ground Effect (OGE) ceiling\n- In Ground Effect (IGE) ceiling\nand converts the pressure altitude to feet MSL.\n\nThe pad also calculates \n\n- Density Altitude\n- Maximum Continuous Power (MCP) \n- 5 minute take off power \n- Never Exceed Speed (V ne) \n\nusing the internal data derived from the original helicopter operating handbook.\n\nYou can also experiment with the all values and find the corresponding maximum helicopter weight for the particular environment.\n\n3. Flight Time Page\nThis page is a complete E6B flight computer with a new and revolutionary graphical user interface. Use the sliders to enter basic values like variation, deviation, wind velocity and direction and the pad will calculate\n\n- Calibrated and True Airspeed \n- True and Magnetic Course \n- Wind Correction Angle (WCA)\n- Compass Heading\n- Ground Speed\n- Flight Time for a specific distance\n\n4. Helicopter Page\nSave and load helicopter setups and performance scenarios. Send weight & balance results to your email address. View important Airspeed Limits and access the Gyronimo Video Channel.\n\n\nWhether you are a professional pilot, student or flight instructor, we are sure that you will benefit from the possibilities of this revolutionary flight computer.\n\n\nProduct Support\nWe hope that the Performance Pad is intuitive to use, however if you have questions or reports please\ncontact us anytime at: info@gyronimosystems.com and we will reply usually within the same day!\n\nVideo Tutorials\nCheck out our video channel on youtube and find a growing number of example calculations.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThe Gyronimo R44 Performance Pad is a student, professional pilot and flight instructor assistance tool for plausibility checks  and flight training only.\n\nAll graphics and data provided in this application are used as examples.

Along the way, the app responds to each child’s actions with positive guidance and motivation. Plus, the app’s digital exploratory playground regularly refreshes with different objects, which keeps children interested and engaged.\n\nINSPIRED BY JEAN PIAGET\nBusy Shapes is inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980), who believed that “children are little scientists”, and that a child's thoughts are built through experiences that encourage him or her to engage in the reasoning process.\n\nINNOVATIVE, SCALEABLE PLATFORM\nBusy Shapes’ innovative scaleable platform for evolving experimentation lets children take advantage of the time they spend on touch screens -- so they aren’t just having fun, but learning every second of the way.\n\nKID-FRIENDLY DESIGN\nBusy Shapes features a special “kid-friendly” design that compensates for the fact that when young children hold an iPad or iPhone, they often have a finger touching the screen.\n\n“PASSING” SWIPE CONTROL\nBusy Shapes features “passing” swipe control that is essential for young children's quick hands (i.e. even if a child's finger reaches an object after he or she was already touching the screen, the object is still grasped as intended).\n\nPOWERFUL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)\nBusy Shapes’ powerful AI supports each child’s unique learning journey. For example, the AI tracks the time it takes each child to complete a level, and increases or decreases difficulty accordingly.\n\nGUIDED ACCESS\nTo prevent children from exiting the app by pressing the “home” button, Busy Shapes features a customizable Guided Access. This feature also disables selected parts of the screen for safety and protection.\n\nSEAMLESS INTERACTION\nBusy Shapes’ seamless interactive game area never blocks or limits children, and lets them freely access shapes. The menu is also neatly hidden away.\n\nAUTOMATIC MEMORY\nSometimes the best learning is a combination of cognitive exercise and physical play. Busy Shapes’ automatic memory saves a child’s place in any particular game, which makes the app an ideal complement to physical play and for shorter games.\n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\nThe app is now available in: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Greek, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support request, please write at support@edokiacademy.com or visit the Edoki Academy Online Community at edokiacademy.com."

And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3.

With more than 120 animals, Toca Life: Pets has every kind of pet you can imagine.\n\nEXPLORE FIVE LOCATIONS\n\nPET PARK: Enjoy the great outdoors with the pets!

Poke around a bit, explore the tree — you might find some surprises to expand your pet family!\n\nPET HOTEL: Sometimes families go on trips without their pets, but thanks to the pet hotel, pets get a vacation of their own! With lots of cozy spaces, an aquarium and outdoor space, every pet will find a nice spot to play or relax — dog or cat, bird or sloth-bat!\n\nVETERINARY: The vet can help sick pets feel better and help healthy pets stay that way! You’ll find pills, drops and the instruments needed to operate on sick or injured pets. Pets can play outdoors or wait on the cozy beds until the vet is ready to see them.\n\nPET SHOP: Find everything you need for to groom, feed, play with and care for your pets at the pet shop. After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice and your characters’ movements as you’re telling the story. Create videos up to two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share your storytelling later! \n\nAbout Us:\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Reflector Director even helps you easily connect to a computer’s Reflector software on limited and restricted networks. The apps are paired directly together with no in-between connections. Use a Quick Connect Code (TM), QR Code or Bluetooth to easily pair. \n \nHow It Works \nSimply open the Reflector Director app on your iOS device and connect to the Reflector 4 software on your computer to begin managing the devices that are connected to the Reflector software. \n \nReflector Director allows you to step away from your computer while still controlling how your audience views the devices that are connected to Reflector 4. Easily show and hide devices, emphasize screens, enable full-screen mode or change device frames all while away from your computer. \n \nReflector Director is compatible with Reflector 4. It REQUIRES this application running on your computer: https://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/download/ \n \nNOTE: Reflector Director does NOT allow you to mirror a device to your iPhone or iPad. Reflector Director DOES allow you to manage the devices that are connected to Reflector 4 software."

But you’ll soon think differently when you learn more about the art of origami.\nRemember making paper airplanes at school? And remember how someone, instead of an airplane, made a flower, a jumping frog, or a parrot? That was like magic. And they only had their two hands and a plain piece of paper. How did they do it? We’ll show you how.\nThe \"How to Make Origami\" app is simple and easy to use. Follow the step-by-step instructions and watch the 3D animation carefully. And don’t worry, you’d have to try really hard to get confused.\n\n\"Hey, that point shouldn’t be sticking out like that!\" Something went wrong? That’s because even an airplane requires concentration and patience. Let this tranquil pastime completely absorb you, and your complete relaxation is guaranteed. You know, those wise Japanese invented a great thing.  \n\nBy the way, origami develops logical reasoning, attention span, spatial thinking and fine motor skills. Consider that when you’re trying to keep fidgety kids busy.\n\nDownload for free over 100 traditional origami instructions for our app. \n\nThe most famous are\n— Origami Frog\n— Origami Giraffe\n— Origami Crane\n— Origami Dinosaur\n— Origami Flower\n— Duck\n— Origami Rose\n— Origami Lily\n— Origami Jumping frog\n— Origami Pigeon\n— Origami Rabbit"

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

The Cry Translator will tell you. Click “…More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n- Awarded Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n\n-  I love it ! A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

Carried in the pockets, phones and emergency vehicles of millions of first responders, this is the guide EMS Magazine calls “the original and still the best.”\n\nThe EMS Field Guide app puts critical information at your fingertips with rich content, detailed illustrations and pioneering features. This app is available in two editions— Advanced Life Support (ALS) and Basic & Intermediate Life Support (BLS)—designed specifically to correspond with each tier of EMT certification and practice, so you know you have the right tool for your job.\n\nThe Advanced Life Support (ALS) app equips the Paramedic or EMT-P to triage and address trauma. It provides fast, easy access to vital assessment information, medications, and drug doses; quick interpretation of 12-Lead EKGs; and the latest CPR and ACLS algorithms from the American Heart Association (AHA). The ALS app is also suitable for Intermediates whose practice orders require a more detailed understanding of these topics. \n\nREVIEWS\n\n“The EMS Field Guide by Informed is probably the most popular pocket reference guide carried on ambulances across the country.”\n\n“I love your guides. I’ve been a paramedic for 25 years and your ALS guides are the best source of reliable on-scene information.”\n\n“This is a great review tool as well as a resource.”\n\n“…Highly recommended in some of my advanced cardiac life support training courses.”\n\n“One of the best things a paramedic can have. A cheat sheet for the things you may not always remember.”\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nInformed Publishing offers a full product line of references for the medical and first response markets, as well as a consumer line for home and family emergency preparedness. Informed references are available in a variety of formats: pocket-size print guides, and now, apps for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.

It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Wherever you are within the allied health professions - medical school, nursing school, NP school, PA school, residency, and beyond - you can improve your knowledge base in the short and long term with these key associative memory aids.\n\nMedical Mnemonics puts 1796 clever acronyms, rhymes, and memory tricks on your iPhone or iPod Touch, covering topics ranging from Anatomy and Biochemistry to Pharmacology and Surgery.\n\nThe database is fully searchable and can be quickly filtered by discipline and by system. Create a Favorites list, and search and filter it similarly.\n\nThe best mnemonics can be those you make yourself. Add your own mnemonics to the database, where they'll appear seamlessly alongside those which come with the program.  Submit them instantaneously to the Medical Mnemonics server for review by an MD (that's me!) and inclusion in the next version.\n\nYou can email any mnemonic to a colleague from within Medical Mnemonics. He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human. If you find a mistake, email us; we will pay a $5 bounty per substantive mistake found to the first reporter of that mistake!"

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

Covering over 80 muscles with more than 150 trigger points.\n\nMyofascial trigger points are one of the most common sources of pain, and are often overlooked by health professionals. \n\nThis app strives to help you find the source of pain via intuitive interface: tap the body where your pain is and see which trigger points refer pain to that area. Over 50 distinct pain areas are covered.\n\nYou can also find trigger points by by tapping a muscle on the muscle model, by choosing a muscle from the alphabetized list, or by using the search bar. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, you can search using keywords such as \"elbow\", which will show the muscles of the elbow as well as any pain areas or conditions related to the elbow (e.g. \"lateral elbow pain\", \"tennis elbow\").\n\nTrigger points can cause or mimic a variety of conditions such as \"Tendinitis\" and \"Tennis Elbow\". More than 40 conditions are covered. Choose a condition and see a list of muscles whose trigger points can cause or mimic that condition.\n\nIn each trigger point illustration, an \"x\" marks the location of the point, while the area of referred pain is colored in blue.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this app does not include treatment information; its aim is to help find the source of specific pain. Once you've identified a trigger point please consult a massage therapist or otherwise trained professional. There are also myriad self-treatment resources available both in book and video format should you choose to treat yourself.\n\n4520c652df"

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

The videos and information are all accessed from within the app with no connection to the internet required. \n \n(*Internet access is required for links accessed from within the app and tertiary video content.)\n\nA unique system that combines live sonoanatomy via ultrasound scans, 3D animated anatomy and real time video of the performance of regional anaesthetic nerve blocks. All elements are combined and synchronised with audible narration.\n\n* Full length offline demonstrations of many regional anaesthetic techniques.\n\n* Insertion of a Pajunk E-Cath (CPNB)\n\n* A video guide to the Pajunk E-Cath, including setting up of the system, insertion and fixation.\n\n* 3D Animated anatomical models, interlinked with live ultrasound scans.\n\n* Synchronised (US and camera) nerve mapping scans.\n\n* Visualise a whole block from start to finish.\n\n* Clear narration during the procedure.\n\n* A source of tips and advice which we wished had been around when we started using ultrasound. \n\n* Easy accessed tabs for Anatomy, Procedure and Tips.\n\n* Stunning full screen diagrams.\n\n* Annotated ultrasound screen shots.\n\n* Fantastic for the novice or experienced anaesthesia provider.\n\n* Learning tool for ODP’s, ODA’s, Anaesthetic nurses, PA(A)’s, AA’s, CRNA’s and all staff working within regional anaesthesia.\n\n* Medical students can gain a better insight into regional anaesthesia.\n\nA tab system gives the user access to anatomy, procedure, tips and equipment. The anatomy tab gives an overview of anatomy related to the specific block, it includes schematic diagram’s which can be expanded to full screen. The procedures tab is a full pictorial and text guide to the performance of the specific block, including annotated ultrasound screen captures to help visualise nerves. The tips tab contains useful advice related to the selected block, also included is advice on the use of ultrasound and local anaesthetics.\n\nA must have app for both junior and senior anaesthetic staff as well as practitioners working within regional anaesthesia.\n\nThe blocks are:\n\nInterscalene & Mapping\nSupraclavicular & Mapping\nInfraclavicular\nAxillary x 2 & Mapping\nRadial Nerve & Mapping\nMedian Nerve & Mapping\nUlnar Nerve & Mapping\nTAP\nFemoral Nerve & CPNB\nSaphenous Nerve\nPopliteal Sciatic\nPECS1\nPECS2\nPECS1 and 2 combined\nSerratus anterior\n\nDedicated nerve mapping videos now make orientating yourself with anatomy even easier. Using demonstrator video interlinked with annotated live ultrasound scanning can help you to locate and track nerves and other relevant anatomy. (The nerve mapping videos will be available as online content to cut down on the size of the app, an internet connection will be required to access these.)More blocks will be added to this app, contact us to let us know what you would like to see in future updates.\n\nwww.raguru.com\n\nThis App is exactly what it says it is - it’s a guide. It doesn’t set out to replace a standard text book. It certainly isn’t a substitute for a sound knowledge of anatomy and local anaesthetic pharmacology. It’s more of a guide to the occasional blocker, a refresher to the more experienced, and a teaching aid to the trainer. \n\nWe are a busy hospital with a heavy teaching commitment. Therefore we choose to use nerve stimulation in conjunction with ultrasound as we feel it adds another layer of safety to the patient, and reassurance to the operator."

Quick Entry views provide immediate access to a wide array of echocardiographic calculations to fuel the Analytic Engine.\n\nUnique to EchoLab among echocardiography applications is the powerful Analytic Engine, which synthesizes results from multiple calculations into a cohesive overview with a comprehensive summary, with integration of ASE/EACVI guidelines. The included companion app for the Apple Watch provides a ready reference when performing or interpreting echocardiograms.\n\nEchoLab displays all data with an assessment of each variable as normal or abnormal by adult criteria. Available with each formula is a graphical display of the corresponding mathematical equation, along with tips for using the calculation and medical literature references with integrated hyperlinks.\n\nCalculations and analyses include:\n\n• Aortic effective regurgitant orifice area\n• Aortic energy loss index\n• Aortic flow acceleration time with ratio to left ventricular ejection time\n• Aortic prosthetic paravalvular regurgitant extent\n• Aortic regurgitant fraction\n• Aortic regurgitant jet width, jet area, pressure half-time, and vena contracta\n• Aortic regurgitation index (for TAVR, from invasive pressure measurements)\n• Aortic root assessment\n• Aortic transvalvular flow rate\n• Aortic valve area (from velocity and velocity-time integrals, including dobutamine stress with projected aortic valve area)\n• Aortic valve resistance\n• Aortic valvulo-arterial impedance (Zva)\n• Body mass index\n• Body surface area\n• Cardiac output and ejection fraction (3D, area-length, Doppler, Dumesnil, Teichholz, simplified Quinones, and Simpson's methods)\n• Diastolic assessment (using either 2009 or 2016 guidelines for analysis)\n• Diastolic stress echocardiography\n• echocardiographic Pulmonary to Left Atrial Ratio (ePLAR)\n• Exercise stress echocardiography\n• Hemodynamic summary\n• Left atrial pressure\n• Left and right atrial volume and index\n• Left ventricular diastolic diameter index\n• Left ventricular dP/dt\n• Left ventricular fractional shortening\n• Left ventricular GLS\n• Left ventricular mass, mass index, and relative wall thickness\n• Left ventricular myocardial performance index\n• Left ventricular stroke work loss\n• Maximum predicted heart rate (for dobutamine and exercise stress)\n• Maximum rate-pressure product (for exercise stress)\n• Mean arterial pressure\n• Mitral effective orifice area (PISA and stroke volume methods)\n• Mitral regurgitant fraction (PISA and stroke volume methods)\n• Mitral regurgitant vena contracta\n• Mitral valve area (continuity, PISA, and pressure half-time methods)\n• Mitral valve resistance\n• Mitral valvuloplasty score\n• Pericardial effusion (size and flow velocity paradoxus)\n• Prosthetic aortic and mitral valve assessment\n• Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (using tricuspid regurgitant velocity, VSD flow velocity, or pulmonary artery acceleration time), diastolic pressure, and mean pressure\n• Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\n• Pulmonary vascular resistance\n• Right atrial pressure\n• Right ventricular-arterial coupling\n• Right ventricular function: dP/dt, fractional area change, index of myocardial performance, lateral annular plane systolic excursion, size, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)\n• Shunt ratio (Qp:Qs)\n• Systemic vascular resistance\n• Tricuspid regurgitant vena contracta\n• Tricuspid valve area (pressure half-time method)\n\nEchoLab is a teaching and reference application, not a tool for clinical diagnosis, clinical decision-making, or echocardiography report generation."

This option can be activated if needed.\n\n- Interference between pyramidal and cerebellar function assessment:\nAs required in the EDSS assessment, if the pyramidal score is greater than 3, an alert will ask you whether there is an interference with the evaluation of cerebellar function. In this case, the cerebral score can be rated but will not be included when determining the EDSS step.\n\nEasy EDSS Score is based on the EDSS score published by Kurtzke et al.

We all know that the patient is the best doctor for himself and now it's up to you!\"\n\nHow? Well, Egyptian, Chinese, Indian, Tibetan doctors and even the Nazis used this alternative medicine technique called iridology. And \"Health Test\" app is an automated iris diagnostics system that will match your iris photo to the iris chart, which divide the iris into zones that corresponds to specific parts of the human body. You wouldn’t believe how much your eyes can tell about your health, it’s all connected. Try and see it for your self! It’s amazing when you can read your self from your eyes.\n\nHealth Test results are automatically generated by doing a three-step process. After analyzing you can run a catalog of the results by date, view them in details and even share it. Eventually you can take actions in your life by doing further investigation with your doctor’s recommendation."

The application has a suggested standard solution based on the schemes most used in intensive care services and allows editing and saving your favorite solutions.\n\nThe application also allows the creation of new solutions from the ampoules available in its service, the calculation of the dosage in mL/hour and the possibility of converting the infused speed into an infused concentration and vice versa. In addition, it is possible to view the therapeutic range individually for the patient's weight as guided by some medical bibliographies and the adjustment of this range by the user depending on the objective and clinical judgment. Thus, the application increases patient safety when prescribing these drugs reducing the risk of calculation errors by the professional.\n\nThe application also has messages to warn about photosensitive solutions and medications that must be diluted in a specific medium such as physiological solution or glucose solution, thus preventing changes in their therapeutic properties.\n\n\nThe application is available in english, portuguese and spanish."

Improve your sleep naturally, maximize your sleep efficiency. \n\nSTOP SNORING\nTries to stop your snoring by playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected.\n\nBy using the tracker data and by defining your own factors (activities/means/drugs/custom notes) it is possible to find out which facts influence your sleep positively and limit your snoring. At your disposal there are beautiful statistic charts for simple and efficient analyzing of your sleeps/nights.\n\nSnoring detection is based on artificial intelligence (A.I.) with the support of a new Apple machine learning technology. By using a large number of snoring samples, we can achieve high accuracy in statistics and in snoring detection itself.\n\nHow to place your device correctly is shown in instructions. \n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- ADJUSTABLE RECORDING SOUND SENSITIVITY:\nFor different sound conditions in your room (a quiet or loud environment).\n\n- HIGH TECH SNORING DETECTION:\nAccurate snoring detection based on A.I.\n\n- POSSIBILITY OF RECORDING ONLY SNORING\n\n- AUDIO VISUALIZATION DURING RECORDING OR PLAYING\n\n- FAVORITE RECORDINGS\n\n- SHARING RECORDINGS WITH YOUR FRIENDS:\nSend recordings via email, iMessage or post to Facebook\n\n- UNLIMITED ALARMS: \nSet your own alarms, daily alarms, weekly alarms, etc. You can use included alarm sounds or your own iPod music.\n\n- SMART WAKE UP: \nWake you up with gradual alarm when you are in your lightest sleep phase (based on your movements).\n\n- SLEEP TRACKER:\nSleep cycle analyzes and statistics with complete history and beautiful charts.\n\n- SNOOZE BY SHAKING:\nNo need to unlock screen or enter password.\n\n- STOP SNORING:\nPossibility of playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected. \n\n- FACTORS, WAKE UP MOOD, NOTES:\nUser can place factors (alcohol, coffee, stress etc.) to every night as well as the mood after waking up or users own notes.\n\n- ACTIVATION DELAY:\nStart monitoring after a period of time.\n\n- BACKGROUND MODE:\nMonitoring runs also in background mode. Alarm also fires from background.\n\n- APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION\n\n- iCLOUD SYNCHRONIZATION:\nSynchronization among your devices and between free and paid version.\n\n- EXPORTING HISTORY TO CSV FILE\n\n- APPLE WATCH:\nTracks your sleep movements and plays haptic (sound, vibration) if alarm is triggered or snoring is detected.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:\n* It is recommended to connect your iPhone (iPad) to a charger.\n* Set \"Airplane Mode\" or \"Do Not Disturb\" on your iPhone (iPad) for undisturbed sleep.\n* Place your iPhone (iPad) according to the instructions (see screenshots).\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\nHappy customers are our highest priority.

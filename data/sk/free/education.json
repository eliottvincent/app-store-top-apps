      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

Moreover, it also provides current news (text and photo), access to live streaming from the Chapel of the Miraculous Image of Merciful Jesus as well as quick information about ongoing works at the Łagiewniki Shrine.\n\nThrough this app, the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, together with many co-workers, shares the gift of the message of Divine Mercy that Jesus gives to the whole world through St. Faustina. St. John Paul II calling St. Faustina’s spiritual wealth and the message of mercy “God’s gift for our times,” passes on this gift to the Church and the world of the Third Millennium. Through this gift, Jesus reminds us about the biblical truth about the merciful love of God for every man and invites us all to proclaim it with new vigor by the witness of life, deeds, words and prayer. The new forms of devotion to Divine Mercy that Jesus gave form part of this message. These are: the Image of Christ with the signature: Jesus, I trust in You, Divine Mercy Sunday which falls on the first Sunday after Easter, Chaplet of Divine Mercy, Hour of Mercy (3:00 PM) and Spreading devotion to Divine Mercy. Great promises are attached to each one of them provided that they are practiced in the spirit of trust in God (fulfillment of His will) and mercy toward neighbor.\n\nWith the death of St. Faustina, God as it were laid down this gift of the message of Mercy at the Shrine in Cracow-Łagiewniki. This is why St. John Paul II called this place the capital of devotion to Divine Mercy. From this place, the message goes out to the entire world carried by modern apostles of Divine Mercy, today reaching many millions. These modern apostles make up the Apostolic Movement of Divine Mercy (this is that new congregation, which Jesus wanted established): various congregations, cloistered and active, male and female, associations, confraternities, apostolates and people who individually undertake St. Faustina’s mission of proclaiming and imploring God’s mercy for the world. This spark needs to be lighted by the grace of God, said John Paul II at the Łagiewniki Shrine, This fire of mercy needs to be passed on to the world. In the mercy of God the world will find peace and mankind will find happiness!"

Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go.

Nájdete v nej všetky naše filmy - \"Spievankovo 1\" prináša deťom známe hity ako Rafaela Stonožka, Ide ide slon alebo pieseň Keď si šťastný. \"Spievankovo 2\" sa venuje štyrom ročným obdobiam, kde spoznáme prírodu a ako sa mení počas roka svet okolo nás. \"Spievankovo 3\" je krásnym nahliadnutím do sveta škôlky. Ukážeme im, ako si umývať, zúbky ručičky, ale zažijeme aj kpec zábavy pri vankúšovej vojne. V \"Spievankove 4\" spoznáme Vílu Nezábudku a Zajka Smejka, ktorí naučia vaše deti hovoriť po anglicky. \"Spievankovo 5\" predstaví deťom rôzne povolania. Lekári, hasiči, policajti či smetiari nám zaspievajú veľmi zábavné piesne a zažijete s nimi veľkú zábavu. \"Spievakovo a Kráľovná Harmónia\" je pútavá rozprávka o hľadaní stratených hudobných nástrojov. Tento film patrí medzi najnavštevovanejšie slovenské rozprávky v kinách vôbec. V aplikácií nájdete aj naše posledné DVD s názvom \"Angličanina\". Tu sa vaše deti môžu tešiť na Vílu Nezábudku a Píšťalku Tidlalku, ktorá je veľmi zábavná, a ktorá sa stále nevie naučiť po anglicky.\r\n\r\nCelkovo na vaše deti čaká vyše 6 hodín zábavy, dobrodružstva a piesní. Navyše obsah aplikácie bude priebežne dopĺňaný o unikátny obsah. Vaše deti nebude vyrušovať reklama a obsah je bezpečný. Príjemnú zábavu!"

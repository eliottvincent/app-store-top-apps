Máte doma ingredience a nevíte co z ní připravit? Vyzkoušejte funkci na hledání receptu podle ingredience. Nechybí ani vyhledávání dle typu jídla, ukládání receptů či jejich hodnocení.\n\nU každého receptu je uveden čas přípravy, obtížnost a také nutriční informace. Máte tak detailní přehled o tom, co konzumujete.\n\nSoučástí mobilní aplikace je také e-shop s vybranými produkty, které autoři receptů používají pro jejich přípravu. V kuchyni se vždy snažíme skloubit kvalitu, cenu a nestárnoucí design. Stejně tak jako na udržitelné stravování, myslíme na udržitelné vybavení, které nemusíte každý rok měnit. Na e-shopu tedy najdete menší množství produktů a značek, s kterými si ale v kuchyni snadno vystačíte a budete tak mít vše, co potřebujete :)\n\nV e-shopu je možné zakoupit také tištěné kuchařky, které pocházejí ze stejného pera jako recepty v aplikaci. V kuchařkách navíc najdete exkluzivní recepty, které v aplikaci nejsou. Pokud tak milujete vůni knih, rádi vaříte podle kuchařek a nebo chcete někomu udělat radost, knižní Jíme zdravě je tou správnou volbou.\n\nTěšíme se na vás! :)"

People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\r\n\r\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "The app has five basic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts and professional help resources.\n\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\n\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\n\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious\n\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\n\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\n\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\n\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\n\nThis app is here for anyone who needs an urgent help in case of depression, anxiety or other issues. The app offers help but it doesn’t replace a consultation with qualified doctor or other specialist. It’s necessary to seek professional help when the situation gets worse. If the app doesn’t help or if you’re unsure whether it has a positive influence on your mental health, please consult its using with your doctor.\nThe advice provided in this application comes from professional practice and is also available in the following sources: \nhttps://positivepsychology.com/anxiety-coping-skills/\nhttps://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/self-harm/helping-yourself-now/\n\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/ichlubna/mind"

No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

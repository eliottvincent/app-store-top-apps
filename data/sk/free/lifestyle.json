      "label": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app.\n\nAlong with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.\n\nThrough our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.\n\n**The I Am Sober app features:**\n\n• Sober day tracker\nTo visualize how long you’ve been sober.\n\n• Remember why you quit\nAdd reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.\n\n• Daily pledge tracker\nTake a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

It’ll show you buzzing places and where you have a high chance of meeting someone new. Skip the nervy phase of meeting. It’ll be with you wherever you would be invisible otherwise. \n\nConnect with people online, share your stories, find a match based on common sympathies and hobbies. Btrfly’s motto is FREE TO MEET YOU and it’s for everyone open to free dating. \n\nYou can use the free-of-charge app version; however, the paid membership brings you extra benefits and you get to know who saw your profile and who likes you. VIP membership skyrockets you to the first place in stories and searches. BOOSTs will definitely make you stick out and that’s what we want. \nYou stick out = you finally find what you are looking for.\n\nIt has features you’ve missed so much until now and which will move your dating experience to a new level: \n\nPeople nearby:\nNo one will slip by without you noticing. The feature is based on the proximity principle. Your object of interest must be in the same area as you, being in the same region is just not enough. Turn the app on in a club, at a festival or simply on the street. Your new discovery is likely where you are. 24-hour history makes sure you are not going to miss out on it.\n\nStories:\nYou are most likely familiar with stories and don’t need any tedious handbooks. Share your stories, show the world your experience. The more they know about you, the higher your chance for the perfect match!\n\nClubs and Events:\nBe where the action is. Thanks to the Clubs and Events feature you can find out what club or event is around you. Moreover, who is there and if it’s vibrant. In this way, you know how to spend the evening. You might even know with whom to spend it. \n\nVIP:\nWhen speaking of you sticking out, we really mean it. Subscription to the VIP feature makes you striking. Your profile will notice everyone that you’re a VIP, not just a mortal commoner. In addition, your profile will be viewed more than the others. \n\nMatching:\nThe good ol‘ classic. Swipe right when interested in the one on the other side, swipe\nleft when not. You can’t go wrong."

Send destination\n- Allows you to pre-plan and set your journey through the app for seamless use in the navigation system.\n\n4. Find my car\n- Keep track of your Kia and remember where you left it, thanks to the Find My Car.\n\n5. Alert notifications\n- You will be notified whenever a car alert is triggered and sent Diagnostic Notifications about the current status of your car.\n\n6. My trips\n- Provides a summary of your previous journey’s including average speed, distance driven, and time in transit.\n\n7. User Profile Transfer and Navi Linkage: \n\n- You will be able to link your User Profile in your car to your Kia Connect app so that you can check and change your vehicle settings on the app anytime. You can also back up your vehicle settings in the Kia Connect app and apply it to your car, as well as store your favorite addresses and send it to your car from the app.  \n\n8.

How much your last journey cost? Or when your next service is due? Make your ŠKODA a connected car!\n\nSimply obtain a ŠKODA Connect LITE DataPlug from your local ŠKODA retailer and plug it into your ŠKODA’s diagnostic port (OBD2). Connect the DataPlug to your smartphone via Bluetooth, register yourself in the app and ŠKODA Connect LITE will transmit all your important vehicle information to your Smartphone. This works for the majority ŠKODA models with an internal combustion engine manufactured since 2008.\n\nŠKODA Connect LITE brings the following features in particular to your smartphone:\n\nMy ŠKODA:\n- Overview of the most important vehicle data, such as vehicle identification number, mileage, fuel tank levels and the date your next inspection service is due.\n\nTrips:\n- Your digital logbook records all journeys driven with the option of identifying and exporting business trips.\n\nStatistics:\n- See an overview of the amount of miles driven and the driving time, fuel consumed and costs of this, breakdown of types of journey (business, private, journey to work) and many other parameters.\n\nDriving style analysis:\n- This function assesses your driving style per journey and provides tips for more efficient driving.\n\nParking space:\n- See where you last parked your vehicle and share your parking space location, e.g. via Whatsapp.\n\nFuel monitor:\n- Save all your fueling actions and automatically calculate the precise fuel costs per journey. This way, you’ll have a constant overview of your fueling costs in the course of the week or the month.\n\nService and appointments:\n- Shows you the ŠKODA authorised workshops nearby and gives you the option of requesting an appointment. In this way, you can easily stay in contact with your preferred authorised workshop\n\nBreakdown assistance:\n- In the case of a breakdown, you have access with just one click to 24-hour breakdown assistance or the ŠKODA service hotline. If a warning light comes on you can find out what it means in the app.\n\nChallenges:\n- Complete exciting tasks and win trophies in your everyday driving.\n\nPlease note:\n- In order to access all functions, when starting you need to register in the app with your ŠKODA ID.\n- For optimal recording of journeys, GPS and Bluetooth must be activated.\n- ŠKODA Connect LITE is compatible with most models manufactured since 2008. Check to see if your ŠKODA is compatible at www.connect-lite.com\n- ŠKODA Connect LITE is primarily a retrofit solution for models without Connective Services manufactured before 2017 and for lower equipment models that do not allow the use of Connective Services after 2017 \n- PHEV and BEV are not fully supported\n- The Data Plug can be obtained from your local ŠKODA retailer.\n- You should always keep your operating system up to date.\n- The use of the GPS function may decrease your battery life."

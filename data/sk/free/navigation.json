We will notify you about the expiring parking session 15 minutes before, so you can prolong it remotely. Currently you can use ParkDots application in the selected cities in Slovakia, Czechia, Poland, Netherlands and Greece. You can pay for parking in Pardubice, Prievidza, Banská Štiavnica, Liptovský Mikuláš, Dolný Kubín and Modra.

You can record your tracks and the application will then render them on the map, calculate various statistics and height profiles. Recorded tracjs are saved in GPX format and you can easily transfer them to your computer.\n\nMain features of the application:\n- displaying the current position on the map,\n- 3D map display,\n- hybrid satellite map,\n- your track recording,\n- search on the map (requires an Internet connection),\n- indicator of the iPhone's current orientation,\n- GPS coordinates, altitude and GPS accuracy display,\n- recorded tracks' statistics - distance covered, time, elevation,\n- tracks height profiles rendering,\n- recorded tracks are saved in GPX format for further processing and can be easily transferred to a computer via iTunes,\n- track recording automatic shutdown after a specified time (e.g. 2 hours),\n- track recording automatic shutdown if the battery level drops below a certain level,\n- GPS accuracy setting (lower accuracy extends battery life).\n\nMap in this application was generated based on data from the OpenStreetMap project and this data is under (c) OpenStreetMap contributors. Map design and tiles are under (c) Daniel Tekel.\n\nImportant notice: The map in this application does not contain all existing hiking trails and points (currently about 90% of the trails are covered)!

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface.

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Most often, the land parcel can be a cadastral parcel, but it can also be part of an agricultural plot where you have for example planted apples. The corner points are defined with GPS (WGS84) coordinates known as latitude and longitude.\r\nAlso the corner points can be defined in other coordinate reference system provided by your geoportal.

We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

Whether you're looking for DKV Mobility service stations or charging points in Europe or within your neighbourhood area, or whether you want to wash or park your vehicle, or even settle your refuelling bill with your smartphone: Our app is always there to guide you to the desired result in just a few steps.\n\nPaying after refuelling directly in your car?\n\nThe APP&GO feature guides you through the entire refuelling process: from selecting the nearest APP&GO station to authorising payment - the DKV Mobility App remains available to help you save valuable time in your daily routine.\n\nCharging your electric vehicle?\n\nThe new update of the DKV Mobility App not only gives you access to over 66,000 fuel stations, but to also more than 200,000 public charging points in our network. It's easy and is just one click away. Another unique feature is the intelligent route planning, where the DKV Mobility App automatically calculates the best route with optimal charging stops for long distances.\n\nNeed to find a station quickly?\n\nWith our new home screen, you have instant access to the station closest to you. You can check the price and start navigation right away.\n\nActively managing time windows in which the DKV CARD can be used?\n\nThe activation mode \"on demand\" offers the possibility to activate cards only for the period in which they are used for a transaction. During the rest of the time, the card is inactive, and transactions will be declined. Simply start the 60-minute time window during which fuel can be purchased. After the time has expired, the card is automatically deactivated again.\n\nWhat other benefits does the DKV Mobility App offer?\n\nIf you need immediate assistance, for example in the event of a breakdown or the loss of your card, the app offers direct dialing to connect you to the helpline.\n\nYou can find more information about our range of services at https://www.dkv-mobility.com/en/. \n\nDKV. You drive, we care."

In addition, then the GPS reception is active in the background. This can quickly drain the battery. Using the app abroad may incur additional roaming charges if your roaming feature is enabled. However, the UTA app also works in offline mode, provided that acceptance point data has already been downloaded in advance.\n \nMore information about our extensive services can be found at https://www.uta.com.\n \nIf you have questions or criticism, we look forward to receiving an email at: info@uta.com app@uta.com\n \nOur privacy policy can be found here: https://www.uta.com/dataprotectioninformation https://web.uta.com/en/data-protection\n \nLegal notice: https://www.uta.com/www.uta.com/legalnotice https://web.uta.com/en/-2eu/legal-notice"

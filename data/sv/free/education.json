Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words.

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain.

To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy.

      "label": "Por medio de T-Box App las instituciones educativas pueden compartir de forma sencilla e inmediata información de interés para los miembros de su comunidad, principalmente con los padres y madres de familia. \n\n¿Hay una noticia que compartir con toda la comunidad? Siguiendo pocos pasos, el administrador de la plataforma en el centro educativo puede crear la noticia con texto, imágenes y vínculos. Luego la publica y esta noticia llega directamente a todos los miembros de la comunidad por medio de la aplicación en sus teléfonos inteligentes. De manera similar se pueden compartir boletines informativos, eventos del calendario escolar, documentos institucionales y tareas, entre otros.\n\nPara utilizar T-Box App es necesario tener una cuenta de estudiante, docente o responsable del alumno. Las cuentas son administradas por cada centro educativo y se activan anualmente de acuerdo al contrato de servicio con T-Box. \n\nLa aplicación se organiza en cuatro secciones principales:\n\nAgenda\nEn esta sección aparecen todas tareas escolares asignadas y los eventos del centro educativo. Se ordenan según la fecha y están diferenciados por colores. Se puede utilizar el filtro de la sección para observar la agenda completa o mostrar solo un tipo específico de elemento, por ejemplo “Eventos del centro educativo”.\n\nCentro educativo\nAquí se encuentra información valiosa compartida desde las instituciones: \n\n- Noticias importantes para la comunidad. \n- Información general del centro educativo.\n- Boletines para informar sobre temas de interés a todos los miembros de la comunidad o a grupos específicos. \n- Calendario escolar que muestra los eventos y fechas de entrega de tareas que han sido generadas por los docentes. \n- Documentos institucionales con archivos que el centro educativo desea compartir con sus miembros: normativas, reglamentos, publicaciones educativas, entre otros.\n\nEspacio estudiantil\nBrinda acceso al muro de T-Box Planet y a las opciones principales de T-Box School, en caso que el centro educativo cuente con esta herramienta. Si un padre de familia tiene más de un hijo en el centro educativo, es importante que seleccione al hijo que desea visualizar desde la administración de cuentas. ¡La información cambia según esa selección!\n\nDesde Espacio estudiantil es posible:\n\n- Acceder a las publicaciones del muro realizadas por docentes y otros estudiantes del grado.\n- Consultar el registro de asistencia en una fecha determinada.\n- Revisar un resumen de las calificaciones por período.\n- Acceder al registro de las citas de seguimiento con todos los detalles de la reunión.\n- También se pueden verificar los códigos de conducta asignados por período.\n\nMensajes\nLa última sección de la aplicación permite enviar y responder mensajes de texto con contactos de la comunidad que estén vinculados con el usuario activo. El botón “Nuevo mensaje” permite iniciar una nueva conversación con los contactos disponibles.\n\nDesde la opción de Configuración se puede cerrar la sesión activa en el app, activar o desactivar las notificaciones y cambiar el idioma. \n\nA través de las notificaciones podrá contar con “avisos” que informen, por ejemplo, sobre nuevas tareas escolares o noticias de interés. Al observar la notificación podrá ver un resumen e ir al app para ver el detalle.\n\nEn T-Box decimos sí a la tecnología que contribuye positivamente en la formación integral de nuestros estudiantes. ¡Esperamos que aprovechen al máximo esta aplicación!"

And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

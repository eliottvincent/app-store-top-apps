Tests may be taken online or offline, though offline testing is preferred to prevent any distractions from notifications. In cases of unstable or intermittent internet connectivity, individual tests and batches may be downloaded to the device ahead of time. Once the user is back online, responses are automatically uploaded and submitted for scoring. Test scores and statuses are also conveniently available within the app."

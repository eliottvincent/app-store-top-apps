      "label": "Want a 99% chance of passing your DMV Permit Test?  With DMV WRITTEN TEST you get state-specific DMV practice tests that are the same as the real test.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n• No Need for the Driver's Manual:  We provide you with the most up-to-date questions based on the current version of your state's official driver's handbook.  Don't be surprised with outdated test questions. We cover every DMV, DDS, BMV, MVA, RMV, DOR, MVC, MVD, DOT, DOL in the country.\n• Take Comprehensive Practice Tests:  Our tests cover every section of the driver's manual so no matter what state you're in, you'll be well prepared.  Go through our practice tests and when you take the real thing, it will seem easy.\n• Pass the DMV Test:  Once you've practiced enough and are passing the practice exams, you should be ready to make an appointment with the DMV.  With a 99% chance of passing, you'll be ready to pass the test the first time!\n\nPRACTICE DMV TESTS MAKE YOU PASS FASTER\nA whopping 5 out of 10 people fail the DMV test the first time they take it, but the people that use DMV Written Test see a 99% pass rate.  We also let you take every sample DMV permit test and DMV license test as many times as needed so you can be sure you're ready for the real thing.\n\nWHY CHOOSE DMV WRITTEN TEST?\n• State-Specific Tests:  Because each state has different driving laws and restrictions, we've tailored our tests to each specific state.  This isn't one of those generic DMV practice tests.  \n• Accurate & Up-to-Date:  We constantly monitor the newest versions of your state's official driving handbook and traffic laws and then update our test questions accordingly.  They are always accurate and up to date.\n• The Same Content:  Since we take our facts directly from the handbooks, it allows us to create practice test questions that are very similar, if not identical, to the questions found on the actual driver's license test.\n\nWHY WE’RE SO EFFECTIVE\n• Know what to expect:  Our tests have the same number of questions and the same passing score requirements as the actual tests so you'll know what to expect.\n• Feel confident as you walk into the DMV:  You've seen it all before and know what's coming.  You got this!\n• Stay motivated to study:  With our practice tests you'll learn as you go and see your own progress in real time.\n\nHAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?\nIf you have any questions, want to report a bug, or notice any errors, feel free to reach out to us."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

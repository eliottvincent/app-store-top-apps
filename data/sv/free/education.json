It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

The master traders  are doing the analysis  and sharing which pair, time, direction  and potential entry price and even including notes to add more clarity \n\n  the users can choose to copy and paste the information if they wish, but that is done at their own risk   \n\nFunctionalities include,  swiping past certain trades you don want, and going back into history to see how the trades panned out over time. Which allows the user an amazing experience   we believe this is a simple yet ground breaking idea  and it will change the way people learn.  Its applicable , simple and hands on !"

      "label": "We are a Ukrainian software developer creating apps for kids. We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education. And today, we are a 250-people team of dedicated designers, artists, animators, and educators. To date, we have more than 30 apps, with our user base having reached 98M.\n\nWe are inspired by the idea of bringing fun into early education and enhancing a child's natural love of learning through educational apps for kids.\n\nIf you need help, have questions or just want to say “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\nhttps://binibambini.com/privacy-policy/\n\nAll our games are safe, and do not collect any personal information."

      "label": "Las 4 técnicas que usa Memodi: \n1) Active recall/evocación activa: es el esfuerzo de recordar lo que acabas de leer. Se aprende mucho más si piensas activamente qué es lo que acabas de leer; el esfuerzo consolida la memoria. Por eso cada párrafo de Memodi contiene preguntas y ejercicios para que no olvides nada.\n2) Textos multimodales: el formato con colores, negritas, subrayados, y demás, permite \"romper\" el texto como si fuera un objeto para comprenderlo mejor. Y por supuesto, lo vuelve todo menos aburrido. Cada punto clave de Memodi es llamativo.\n3) Diversificación: estudios demuestran que es mejor leer temas \"salteados\" entre sí, porque eso permite crear conexiones y consolidar más el conocimiento.\n4) Repetición espaciada: Cuando lees algo, ¿cuánto recuerdas en 1 semana? ¿Y en 3 semanas? Aunque la memoria humana es increíble, estamos hechos para olvidar. Es ahí donde entra la Repetición Espaciada. Gracias al algoritmo, la aplicación va a agendar los repasos que tengas que hacer de los puntos clave, separándolos entre sí lo suficiente para que jamás los olvides. Así podrás recordar desde cosas tan esenciales como el tratamiento de la enterocolitis necrosante y la escala de Bell, hasta el cromosoma y gen que se muta en Fibrosis quística.\nLo único que tienes que hacer es dedicarle unos minutos durante el día, cuando sea que puedas y te sientas listo. Ideal para estudiar durante una guardia o mientras esperas tu café. Sin el problema de buscar información, de leer cosas que no sirven y por supuesto, de olvidar.\n\nMemodi está diseñada por un médico, pensando en la vida de otro médico. Guardias, cantidad exorbitante de información y temas, literatura únicamente escrita en inglés o de fuente dudosa, falta de tiempo o de energía para estudiar; todo eso se acabó.\nMemodi está diseñada para: estudiantes de medicina del último año, Médicos Internos (MIP), Médicos Pasantes del Servicio Social, Médicos Generales que quieran presentar el ENARM o que simplemente quieran tener la información siempre fresca y mantenerse actualizados, Médicos Especialistas que deseen no olvidar la Medicina de otras áreas.\n\nMemodi contiene:\nA) +2,500 puntos clave de +900 temas de toda la Medicina, y todas las especialidades: Dermatología, Endocrinología, Reumatología, Neumología, Cardiología, Infectología, Cirugía, Neurocirugía, Cirugía Vascular, Medicina Interna, Traumatología, Anestesiología, Gastroenterología, Pediatría, Ginecología, y más (para una lista completa visita: https://memodiapp.com/lista-de-temas). Los temas se encuentran divididos en 3 partes: 1) Definición, epidemiología, causas y patogenia, 2) Clínica y diagnóstico, 3) Tratamiento, prevención/screening, complicaciones.\nB) Los puntos clave están basados en los mejores Journals, Guías Internacionales y literatura reciente, pero traducidos al español y escritos de una manera fácil de leer; no tardarás más de 1 minuto por tarjeta. Además, todos tienen formato para que sea aún más fácil recordar y leer.\nC) Gracias a que la base de datos está en la nube, la información es actualizable con los últimos estudios y descubrimientos que cambian la práctica médica.\nD) Tiene una interfaz sencilla de usar; de hecho lo único que tienes que hacer es leer y presionar un botón para ver la siguiente tarjeta de información.\n\nFuncionamiento. Es fácil, inicia hoy mismo:\n1) Baja la aplicación y regístrate para sincronizar tu progreso en la nube.\n2) Selecciona cuántas tarjetas/puntos clave nuevos por día quieres ver. Te recomendamos 6-10.\n3) Dedícale unos minutos al día, y deja que el algoritmo haga el resto, mientras tú te dedicas a estudiar Medicina de la manera más inteligente con Memodi.\nTérminos de uso: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Graded entirely on your pronunciation, our app makes language learning fresh and fun.\n\nLearn to speak Spanish, French, German and English like a native speaker. Unlike traditional language learning apps, that teach you ‘classroom’ speak, Univoice teaches you to speak a new language as it’s spoken in the real world, including idioms and slang words.\n\nJust load up the app, select the language and genre of music that suits your mood and start singing along with the artist. As you sing or speak, you can see the translation of the lyrics back into your native language.\n\nWe’ll grade you on your pronunciation, not your pitch or tone, so you can see how well you’ve done and how you improve over time!\n\nLong gone are the days of memorizing long vocabulary lists, repeating the same keywords and phrases, or reading pages of grammar rules. Now you can learn through song – scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn how to speak a new language!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nHow does the Univoice app work?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**No singing skill required! We grade only on pronunciation**\n• Pick from Spanish, French, German, and English\n• Choose from a wide range of 30+ music genres\n• Sing (or speak) with the artist in the language you’re learning\n• Follow the translation into your native language as you speak\n• Familiarize yourself with idioms & slang words you won’t find in a textbook\n• Expand your vocabulary & learn new phrases the fun way... through music!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat motivates Univoicers to learn a new language?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n• Becoming a global citizen & raising globally-minded children\n• Connecting with others in a more meaningful, organic way\n• Staying tightly connected to heritage & strengthening family ties\n• Communicating more fluidly with coworkers, clients, patients\n• Learning to speak (and sing) a dream language like a native\n• Immersing oneself in the culture, while learning the language\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat subscription plans does Univoice offer?\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAll app users will receive 5 minutes / day, free of charge.\n\nOur auto-renewable premium plans feature unlimited song access, across the following term lengths:\n\n• Weekly: $2.99\n• Monthly: $8.99\n• 3 Months: $17.99 \n• 6 Months: $35.99\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEntertain & educate yourself with Univoice.

      "label": "Want a 99% chance of passing your DMV Permit Test?  With DMV WRITTEN TEST you get state-specific DMV practice tests that are the same as the real test.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n• No Need for the Driver's Manual:  We provide you with the most up-to-date questions based on the current version of your state's official driver's handbook.  Don't be surprised with outdated test questions. We cover every DMV, DDS, BMV, MVA, RMV, DOR, MVC, MVD, DOT, DOL in the country.\n• Take Comprehensive Practice Tests:  Our tests cover every section of the driver's manual so no matter what state you're in, you'll be well prepared.  Go through our practice tests and when you take the real thing, it will seem easy.\n• Pass the DMV Test:  Once you've practiced enough and are passing the practice exams, you should be ready to make an appointment with the DMV.  With a 99% chance of passing, you'll be ready to pass the test the first time!\n\nPRACTICE DMV TESTS MAKE YOU PASS FASTER\nA whopping 5 out of 10 people fail the DMV test the first time they take it, but the people that use DMV Written Test see a 99% pass rate.  We also let you take every sample DMV permit test and DMV license test as many times as needed so you can be sure you're ready for the real thing.\n\nWHY CHOOSE DMV WRITTEN TEST?\n• State-Specific Tests:  Because each state has different driving laws and restrictions, we've tailored our tests to each specific state.  This isn't one of those generic DMV practice tests.  \n• Accurate & Up-to-Date:  We constantly monitor the newest versions of your state's official driving handbook and traffic laws and then update our test questions accordingly.  They are always accurate and up to date.\n• The Same Content:  Since we take our facts directly from the handbooks, it allows us to create practice test questions that are very similar, if not identical, to the questions found on the actual driver's license test.\n\nWHY WE’RE SO EFFECTIVE\n• Know what to expect:  Our tests have the same number of questions and the same passing score requirements as the actual tests so you'll know what to expect.\n• Feel confident as you walk into the DMV:  You've seen it all before and know what's coming.  You got this!\n• Stay motivated to study:  With our practice tests you'll learn as you go and see your own progress in real time.\n\nHAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?\nIf you have any questions, want to report a bug, or notice any errors, feel free to reach out to us."

More accessible than Chrome, this app features ad-free search capabilities for more efficient studying without distractions. \n\nJapanese Dictionary is a Japanese-English offline dictionary featuring over 160000 entries, over 10000 kanji and almost 60000 example sentences.\nJapanese Dictionary also is a Japanese language learning tool. It includes translations of some words in French, German and Russian and displays example sentences, kanji information and conjugated forms for each word.\n\nThe words can be searched using kanji, kana, romaji or latin alphabets. Full sentences and conjugated forms are also recognized. Kanji can be searched by selecting multiple radicals.\n\nLike most of the Japanese dictionary apps out there, the data is from the awesome JMdict project made by the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group thanks to Jim Breen and others.\n\nABOUT PERMISSIONS\nNetwork Connection Permission is used to send your contributions to jisho.org if you do so in the app, otherwise nothing is sent and network connection is not required (dictionary works offline).\n\nAcknowledgments:\n- Electronic Dictionaries Research Groups\n- KanjiVG\n- Tatoeba\n- KanjiCafe\n- Tanos (JLPT)\n\nNote: The data also get from some popular Japanese Dictionary\n- Jisho\n- Japandict\n- Tangorin\n- Takoboto\n- Romajidesu & Romaji desu\n- Tofugu"

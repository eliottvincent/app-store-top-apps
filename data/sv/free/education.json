Graded entirely on your pronunciation, our app makes language learning fresh and fun.\n\nLearn to speak Spanish, French, German and English like a native speaker. Unlike traditional language learning apps, that teach you ‘classroom’ speak, Univoice teaches you to speak a new language as it’s spoken in the real world, including idioms and slang words.\n\nJust load up the app, select the language and genre of music that suits your mood and start singing along with the artist. As you sing or speak, you can see the translation of the lyrics back into your native language.\n\nWe’ll grade you on your pronunciation, not your pitch or tone, so you can see how well you’ve done and how you improve over time!\n\nLong gone are the days of memorizing long vocabulary lists, repeating the same keywords and phrases, or reading pages of grammar rules. Now you can learn through song – scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn how to speak a new language!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nHow does the Univoice app work?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**No singing skill required! We grade only on pronunciation**\n• Pick from Spanish, French, German, and English\n• Choose from a wide range of 30+ music genres\n• Sing (or speak) with the artist in the language you’re learning\n• Follow the translation into your native language as you speak\n• Familiarize yourself with idioms & slang words you won’t find in a textbook\n• Expand your vocabulary & learn new phrases the fun way... through music!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat motivates Univoicers to learn a new language?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n• Becoming a global citizen & raising globally-minded children\n• Connecting with others in a more meaningful, organic way\n• Staying tightly connected to heritage & strengthening family ties\n• Communicating more fluidly with coworkers, clients, patients\n• Learning to speak (and sing) a dream language like a native\n• Immersing oneself in the culture, while learning the language\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat subscription plans does Univoice offer?\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAll app users will receive 5 minutes / day, free of charge.\n\nOur auto-renewable premium plans feature unlimited song access, across the following term lengths:\n\n• Weekly: $2.99\n• Monthly: $8.99\n• 3 Months: $17.99 \n• 6 Months: $35.99\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEntertain & educate yourself with Univoice. Learn a new language today!"

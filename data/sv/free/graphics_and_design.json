      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

      "label": "Sketchar is for creators and for those who’ve always wanted to create. Our technology merges computer vision and augmented reality to speed up the creator learning process, and to make it more entertaining!\n\nHere are some unique features only on Sketchar:\n\n1. AUGMENTED REALITY drawing guidance\nUsing your smartphone camera, you’ll see an AR sketch on a surface in front of you. Then, just take a pencil and follow the virtual lines step-by-step. (This feature is also used by professionals to scale sketches onto larger surfaces like walls.)\n\n2. Turn your art into NFTs\nMake your art into NFTs and quickly fast-forward through all the stages of becoming a popular artist.\n\n3. AI PORTRAITS\nTurn photos into illustrations with just a tap — your smartphone can quickly do what the professional artists do.\n\n4. AR MASKS for Snapchat\nCreate your own AR mask using this exclusive feature, then share directly to Snapchat.\n\n5. Virtual CANVAS with a step-by-step guide\nNo paper on hand to use our AR feature? You can practice with the help of our drawing tool: it gives you the right tool at the right time (pencil, marker, or brush).\n\n6. A plethora of LESSONS\nLearn with one of our many step-by-step tutorials. You can start with a beginner lesson or delve deeper into a specific topic to improve your artistic skills. Learn to draw animals, cartoons, anime, graffiti, and lots of other cool stuff!\n\n7. MINI-GAMES\nTrain your creativity and other useful skills with interactive mini-games.\n\n8. SHARE your work\nShare achievements with friends. Time-lapse videos of each of your creations are automatically saved to your profile.\n\n----\nFOR CORRECT DETECTION, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE TIPS:\n- Find a well-lit environment — AR technology requires sufficient lighting.\n- Use a clipboard or similar device, otherwise, your paper will move as you draw.\n- Don't shake your smartphone.\n----\nIn-app purchases: Sketchar offers three paid auto-renewable subscription options that give you unlimited access to premium content and features.\n1-Week Subscription – $7.99 / Month\n1-Year Subscription with 3-Day Trial – $69.99 / Year\n1-Year Special Offer Subscription – $44.99 / Year\nPrices may vary across countries. They are equal to the value that Apple's App Store Matrix determines as the equivalent of the subscription price in USD.\n\nWe’re always interested in your feedback, so please contact us at support@sketchar.tech!\n\nTerms of Use: https://sketchar.io/terms/\nPrivacy Policy: https://sketchar.io/privacy/"

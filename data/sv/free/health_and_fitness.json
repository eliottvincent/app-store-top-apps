Instead, I'm making and eating a limited number of fresh and healthy meals/snacks on a repeat basis.\n\nI made this app because I just wanted a simple way to quickly input my own custom foods (an area that is severely lacking in other free apps).  And I wanted to be able to re-use those foods as they were or to modify the \"serving\" amount.  \n\nInstead of wondering whether this is a small, medium or large apple/tomato/etc., I can add the nutrition of a tomato at 100 grams.  Then I weigh a tomato of any size, select my previously input tomato, and change the serving size to match the weight of this tomato.  The macro / calorie information updates automatically.\n\nI hope you find this app helpful in achieving your goals!"

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps.

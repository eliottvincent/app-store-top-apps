      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier. Install the Dr. Kegel app to amaze your partner, stay confident & be happy. Install now & you won’t regret it!\r\n\r\nWe offer a wide range of subscription options.

Here’s how:\n\n• Record everything – runs, rides, hikes, yoga and over 30 other sport types. Think of Strava as the homebase of your movement.\n\n• Discover anywhere – our Routes tool uses de-identified Strava data to intelligently recommend popular routes based on your preferences. You can also build your own.\n\n• Build a support network – Strava’s about celebrating movement. Here you’ll find your community and cheer each other on.\n\n• Train smarter – get data insights to understand your progress and see how you improve. Your Training Log is the record of all your workouts.\n\n• Move safer – share your real-time location with loved ones while outdoors for an extra layer of safety.\n\n• Sync your favorite apps and devices – Strava is compatible with thousands of them (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin – you name it).\n\n• Join and create challenges – join millions in monthly challenges to chase new goals, collect digital badges and stay accountable.\n\n• Embrace the unfiltered – your feed on Strava is filled with real efforts from real people. That’s how we motivate each other.\n\n• Whether you’re a world-class athlete or a total beginner, you belong here. Just record and go.\n\nStrava includes both a free version and a subscription version with premium features.\nStrava uses HealthKit to export your Strava activities into the Health app and to read heart rate and biometric data.\n\nYou can subscribe and pay on the App Store, using your Apple ID.

      "label": "My Cycle is an app that helps you monitor your cycle. How often have you asked: \"What date did my period start last month?\" With our app, you won't have to keep that important information in your head. Take note of your menses in our app, and it will automatically remind you about the start of a new cycle several days before it happens.\n\nIf you're planning to get pregnant, this app tells you what days you are most likely to conceive.\nBesides monitoring your cycle, you can keep track of other important information. Add important events related to your sex life. Add notes to remember such things as symptoms and mood changes. You can use this app as your personal journal.\n\nMy Cycle is made specially for women like you.\nIf you have any questions or requests, please write to neumandev@gmail.com. We are eager to hear your comments on how to improve the app."

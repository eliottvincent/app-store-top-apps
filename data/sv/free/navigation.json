Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

Safedriver allows parents to monitor their children behavior behind the wheel. Safedriver also reduce the use of Smartphones and control the speed while they are driving. Our app is an innovative solution to reduce car accidents among teenagers rewarding them if they drive safely.\n \nSafeDriver  “The App that saves lives”\n\nManipulating the smartphone, having a social media conversation, post, talking, surfing the web, etc. while driving could be the last thing a person would do. Smartphone distractions while driving increase 24 times the risk of a car accident. Our engineers at Webtrack, understand that responsible behavior is the key to developing safe driving habits, whether you are a teen, a parent, an educator, or a community member.\n\nWe found that most parents have rules and restrictions for their teen driver, however only a small proportion had formalized these rules via a parent-teen driving agreement. Parents reported worrying more about their teen driver’s safety during the learner permit phase, when crash risk is very low compared with crash risk when the teen begins to drive independently. Parental awareness of teen drivers’ safety after licensure and the understanding of the importance of parental rules and restrictions for shaping teen driving behavior could be improved. Interventions that directly engage parents and provide concrete tools such as a parent-teen driving agreement have been reported to reduce risky driving among teens\nSafeDriver is a mobile app installed in the driver’s Smartphone, it automatically is activated during a trip, setting the behavior rules to reduce the risk of an accident.\n\nSafeDriver is location and monitoring application linked to the driver’s vehicle through an electronic Bluetooth Low Energy accessory developed by Webtrack, any other HF Bluetooth protocol or even a built in Bluetooth accessory that comes from the car company factory.\n\n*Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.\n\nYou can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.\n\nIf you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details – all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments. \n\nFeedFinder is part of a project by Open Lab Newcastle University, UK.

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One!

      "label": "Makes from your iPhone/iPad a complete GPS device with detailed topographic maps. Viewed maps will be stored on your device so that Topo GPS can also be used offline.\n\nWhy should you buy an expensive GPS device if you can install Topo GPS? Topo GPS contains all functions of a regular GPS device for less money, has a much more detailed map, and is more convenient to operate. The accuracy of the position determination is in favorable conditions about 5 m.\n\nIdeal for walking, hiking, cycling, mountain biking, sailing, horse-riding, geocaching, scouting, trail running and other outdoor activities. Also suited for outdoor professionals.\n\n- Map\n* To use Topo GPS you need to buy a map.\n* Official topographic maps of many countries, including Great Britain (OS Explorer), New Zealand and Australia are available as in-app purchase. \n* Topographic maps are very detailed maps, include height contours and are very suited for outdoor activities.\n* All maps of a certain region can be made offline accessible using the map download screen.\n* Easy switching between maps.\n\n- Routes\n* Recording routes, with pause and restart possibility.\n* Planning routes via route points.\n* Generating routes\n* Editing routes\n* Synchronization with your other devices via iCloud.\n* Searching routes with filters.\n* Routes can be organized into folders.\n\n- Waypoints\n* Easy adding by pressing long on map.\n* Adding waypoints through address or coordinates.\n* Sharing waypoints.\n* Editing waypoints.\n\n- Layers\nLayers contain information that can be added to and removed from the map.\n* Long distance bicycle routes\n* Mountainbike routes\n\n- Coordinates\n* Easy entering coordinates\n* Scanning coordinates\n* Supported coordinate systems:\nWGS84 decimal, WGS84 degree minutes (seconds), UTM, MGRS, and other country specific coordinate systems.\n* Coordinates grid layers\n\n- Intuitive interface\n* Clear menu with most important functions.\n* Different dashboard panels with distance, time, speed, altitude and coordinates.\n* Clear manual at www.topo-gps.com\n\n- Supported file formats:\n* gpx, kml/kmz, geojson (all also zip compressed), WFS, csv\n\n\nIf you are recording a route, the GPS will run in the background. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nRdzl, the company behind Topo GPS, does not obtain in any way the position of the user of Topo GPS. Rdzl does also not obtain the routes recorded by the user, and save the routes planned by the user, unless the route is shared with Topo GPS. We sell our product, not our user data.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.topo-gps.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://www.topo-gps.com/terms-of-use"

      "label": "Lafayette, Ind. –July 15, 2018--CityBus is rolling out MyRide, a new GPS-based bus location system. Using MyRide, riders can access transit schedules and real-time GPS-based bus location information, track their bus on a map, and receive transit news and route-specific alerts. \n\nWhen the MyRide app is downloaded on a rider’s phone, geolocation determines the closest bus stops to their location. And with one screen-tap, riders can view estimated departure times for the next buses and routes servicing these stops.\n\nBy selecting a favorite location or route, or entering a starting point and destination, riders can get real-time GPS-based information for all possible bus options. A trip planner can also make future transit plans. Riders can track the location, estimated departure time and passenger load of the selected bus on an interactive map powered by Google. \n\nFrom their customer account, riders can subscribe to receive text, email or push-notifications containing bus departure information, including one-time or recurring notifications for specific routes, days and times. Another feature identifies detoured routes and temporary stops.\n\nCityBus can also post news stories about weather, detours, or community events, publish route-specific or general news, or add pictures or video content. \n\nRiders without data plans can get real-time information as well by texting a designated phone number. After inputting their stop number, the system will automatically return estimated departure times for the next buses."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Can be also used as a coordinates converter. You can use map to check or set waypoint location and add photo or audio note.\n+ Share your location via email, text message, Facebook or Twitter. This includes UTM, MGRS and Latitude/Longitude (MENU>Share my location).\n+ You can use UTM, MGRS or Lat/Long, just pick your preference in settings (Coordinate Format).\n+ Speedometer. Shows you the speed and pace. Speedometer also gives you options to control average and max speed and pace counters (MENU > RESET and PAUSE/RESUME counters).\n+ Compass. Instant reaction compass, no delays. Automatically pickups the direction based on magnetic or GPS course. If you mostly walk or drive, you can change this automatic mode in app settings > Compass or GPS course. NATO mils? Same place in settings to set.\n+ Magnetic declination δ for the current location and any location on the map (via World Magnetic Model, WMM, no need for data/internet).\n+ Sunset and sunrise. So you can plan your travel better.\n+ Arrow pointing to your target waypoint. Distance and bearing to it.\n+ Create/measure routes and areas.\n+ Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\nAll above belong to a basic version. PRO Pack upgrade will add following capabilities:\n\n+ Recording and sharing GPS tracks.\n+ Moving waypoints between folders.\n+ Showing ETA to a target as this requires GPS tracking.\n+ Native Google map with fantastic terrain map, amazing 3D and real night mode.\n+ Adding own/custom tile map servers.\n+ Downloading offline maps. Offline maps import in .sqlitedb, rmaps, mbtiles formats.\n+ GPX import and export for waypoints, tracks and routes. \n+ Google Earth KML support for waypoints and tracks import/export. KMZ support for waypoints and tracks export, waypoints import.\n+ CSV import/export for waypoints.\n+ Voice coach to tell you active track distance and duration, current speed and altitude without need to open the app.\n+ Support for Siri shortcuts in IOS 12 for starting and stopping GPS tracks.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE. App will work in background automatically when tracking. You can use other apps while Compass 55 does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Compass 55 never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for telling you direction to a target and recording GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always lets you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless the track is being recorded.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). As quite a lot of us are using external GPS modules, app is available for wifi only iPads and iPods.\n\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

It offers direct access to navigation, calls, messages, and music through its smart, driving-purposed interface. It’s designed to keep you focused on what really matters — on the road ahead. \n\nNavigation: \nEnter your destination or search for a POI — HUDWAY will create the best route to commute and give you turn-by-turn directions. The live 3D view of the road is easy to grasp, and you won’t get lost even at the most complicated junctions. And you won’t need Internet for that — the app will download offline maps for you to drive offline — globally!\n\nCalls:\nKeep your eyes on the road when receiving an incoming call — and use a swipe to accept or dismiss it. Add contacts to favorites and call them with one tap. \n\nMusic:\nConnect your Spotify account or music library — and manage tracks with quick swipes and taps. You can also listen to hundreds of radio stations from all over the world (please note that you’ll need Internet for streaming online audio).\n\nWidgets: \nQuickly view your speed, ETA, trip statistics and driving score — and share your location with just one tap.\n\nRecommendations on app use: \nMount your phone anywhere in your car where it’s convenient for you to quickly reach it — for example, above the airvent. The app can be used as is, but together with our HUDWAY Cast device it will give you an unparalleled experience of driving with a real heads-up display: you’ll still be able to manage your calls, messages, and music on your smartphone, whereas navigation will be streamed wirelessly onto a transparent lens right in your line of sight. \n\nLearn more and get HUDWAY Cast device at hudwaycast.com"

That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities. Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser. As such, it inherits all the Midori functionalities. It supports many of the most popular parts of the web, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify and Rdio."

Organise them in mosaics and favourites. \n   · Zoom in to see gas stations with their prices, cameras and speed cams\n\n- GAS PRICE:\n   · Find gas stations on the “Traffic Map” (zoom in) or in “Routes” (they are ordered by price in each route you have created)\n   · Prices updated every minute\n   · Tap and hold for a second on the “Traffic Map” to find nearby gas stations ordered by price.\n   · Configure in settings how much you would like to deviate from your route to find cheap gas (cheap gas stations aren’t placed in main roads), a second gas type, and with how much zoom they are shown on the “Traffic Map”\n   · Create your gas station favourite list to check their prices easily\n\n- MORE:\n   · Choose the tab where the app is initiated according to what you use more: Warner, Traffic Map, or Routes.\n   · Warn your friends of problems in the road via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, iMessage,…\n   · Traffic Alarms to remember checking the traffic and avoid traffic jams\n\n- The paid version (the “pro”) includes everything, it doesn’t have ads or in-app purchases. The free one has one in-app purchase which enables the automatic update of speed cams (the speed of speed cams is not shown on the Watch without this in-app purchase, although a general warning is given), enables CarPlay, removes the ads, and allows to chose dark/light mode independently of the iPhone settings. If you buy it, you would have the same functionality of the paid version.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- To use the Warner you need your device to have a GPS integrated: all iPhones have it, iPod and iPad WiFi do NOT have it (iPad 3G DOES have it). The rest of the functionality (routes, traffic, gas price) works in any device.\n\nATTENTION! The Speed Cam Warner uses your GPS. Continuos use of the warner in fore or background can drain your battery quickly."

Up to four dash cams can be wirelessly connected with the Dash Cam Auto Sync feature to provide comprehensive coverage around a vehicle, offering various viewpoints recorded by the multiple cameras. The Garmin Drive app can create a “picture-in-picture” video from any two perspectives at the same time, making it easy to review video and also share videos with friends, insurance agencies, or legal authorities.\r\n \r\nGarmin Speak™ and Garmin DriveSmart™ 65 with Amazon Alexa are two Garmin products that bring what you love about Amazon Alexa to your vehicle. Just ask Alexa to hear music, news, and more. Also, enjoy Garmin turn-by-turn navigation. Stream the audio (music and other responses) from your vehicle’s stereo when you connect Garmin Speak to your stereo using Bluetooth® or AUX.\r\n \r\nOlder Bluetooth-capable Garmin navigators are compatible with the Garmin Smartphone Link app, and older Wi-Fi-enabled Garmin dash cams can access video footage through the Garmin VIRB app."

Check the weather before and during trips, ocean races, regattas, cruises and all other types of offshore passages.\n\nA compass is also integrated into this tracking app. This easy-to-use compass helps you to determine your own current position and thus helps you spotting ships with the ship radar map around your current location.\n\nAre you wondering how it is possible that all this information appears live on your smartphone or tablet? Most modern ships have an AIS (Automatic Identification System) transceiver installed. This transceiver then sends the marine traffic information to a network of ship traffic stations around the world, so that you can see the exact current ship position and details about the ship.\n\nDownload the free ship tracker app now!"

It supports HTML 5 + CSS 3, and is based in Webkit. \n\nCroPlus gives you the power to take back control of your Web experience. That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities.

Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser.

Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

      "label": "Hudway Go is a simple GPS navigation app for drivers. \nIt keeps it very intuitive and non-distracting, displaying just the outline of the road you’re driving and your next manoeuvre.\n\n***\n\"Hudway is one of the cleverest driving apps we've seen\"\n— CNET\n\n\"Hudway app is unbelievably cool for one special reason: It actually lets you see your directions and route right on your windshield\"\n— USA Today\n\n\"Hudway HUD tool will remind you nothing less than a science fiction movie that you watched recently\"\n— crazyengineers.com\n\n\"HUDWAY turns your windshield into a jet fighter cockpit\"\n— digitaltrends.com\n***\n\nHUDWAY Go helps you drive safer in fog, rain, heavy snow, in dusk and darkness.\n\nCreate a route and place your smartphone on the dashboard — you’ll see the route reflected on your windshield. Keep your eyes on the road and know in advance what’s ahead — a straight run, or a ramp-turn. This is especially handy when driving between cities.\n\nFeatures:\n- Intuitive 3D map, simple navigation\n- Voice Assistance\n- Speed limits\n- Long tap on the map to set the destination\n- Fuel consumption calculation\n- Transit points\n- Search for addresses and POI\n- Choose alternative routes\n- Drive offline right after you start\n- The app will recalculate the route if you leave it\n- Classic GPS map navigation mode\n- Head-up display (HUD) mode\n- Trip info: ETA, speed, distance traveled, directions on the next manoeuvre, and more\n- Based on OpenStreetMap (OSM)\n\nNote: If you face any problems or find any bugs, please email us at support@hudwayapp.com or report the bug right from the app.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $2.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nIf you want to use HUD during a day-time — there is a special accessory HUDWAY Glass: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

      "label": "Speedometer by HUDWAY offers a brand new way to control speed when driving. A remedy against the speeding tickets, the app keeps you aware on what speed limitation is set for the current road section and alerts when you're exceeding it.\n\nThe app is straight and handy, with no tricky settings. Launch the app and place the phone onto the dashboard close to the windshield (if you want to use it in Head-Up Display or HUD mode and see the reflection on the windshield), or into the mount (for standard use).  It's specifically designed to offer you a safe and non-distracting visual assistance.\n\nPerfectly works in the background — tracks your speed and gives sound alerts when you're exceeding, even when you're using some other app (for example, some navigation one).\n\nHUDWAY Speedometer is a good company in any journey as it:\nKnows current speed limitation (both within cities and on highways);\nWorks in both standard and HUD mode. HUD mode allows using your smartphone or tablet as a projector. Just place your device close to the windshield, and the screen image will get reflected and displayed on the windshield. Keep your eyes on the road — everything you need is displayed right in front of you!\nDoesn't require much attention. The app is designed to be comfortably used without direct focus on it. Your peripheral sight will be enough to keep you aware.\nAlerts on sped limits, as well as on speed cameras and radars.\nDoesn't need Internet connection to work. Needs Internet only at first launch.\nIt simply works. And does it very neatly!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $4.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location.

You can then tap to view street view, share or get directions (via Apple Maps or iMaps+).\n\nAlternatively, drag the yellow peg man from the top left hand corner of the map and release over a road or path to access street view.\n\nStreet view supports zooming in and out, and showing a mini-map overlay. There is also a full screen mode for a more immersive experience.\n\nIf you need a more complete Google Maps experience, look for \"iMaps+ for Google Maps\" on the App Store. iMaps+ provides all the great functionality from iStreets with the addition of directions, traffic, contacts integration and more.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nSubscriptions: iStreets operates as a subscription service. Recurring purchase is required for full functionality. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed, and auto-renewal may be turned off, from iStreets settings or the Apple Settings app. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited if you change your subscription term.\n\nDirections, street view and live traffic details are only available in certain geographical regions.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nTerms of Service: http://apptility.co.uk/imaps_tos.html\n\nApptility Limited is not related to, or affiliated with, Google, Inc.

Can be also used as a coordinates converter. You can use map to check or set waypoint location and add photo or audio note.\n+ Share your location via email, text message, Facebook or Twitter. This includes UTM, MGRS and Latitude/Longitude (MENU>Share my location).\n+ You can use UTM, MGRS or Lat/Long, just pick your preference in settings (Coordinate Format).\n+ Speedometer. Shows you the speed and pace. Speedometer also gives you options to control average and max speed and pace counters (MENU > RESET and PAUSE/RESUME counters).\n+ Compass. Instant reaction compass, no delays. Automatically pickups the direction based on magnetic or GPS course. If you mostly walk or drive, you can change this automatic mode in app settings > Compass or GPS course. NATO mils? Same place in settings to set.\n+ Magnetic declination δ for the current location and any location on the map (via World Magnetic Model, WMM, no need for data/internet).\n+ Sunset and sunrise. So you can plan your travel better.\n+ Arrow pointing to your target waypoint. Distance and bearing to it.\n+ Create/measure routes and areas.\n+ Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\nAll above belong to a basic version. PRO Pack upgrade will add following capabilities:\n\n+ Recording and sharing GPS tracks.\n+ Moving waypoints between folders.\n+ Showing ETA to a target as this requires GPS tracking.\n+ Native Google map with fantastic terrain map, amazing 3D and real night mode.\n+ Adding own/custom tile map servers.\n+ Downloading offline maps. Offline maps import in .sqlitedb, rmaps, mbtiles formats.\n+ GPX import and export for waypoints, tracks and routes. \n+ Google Earth KML support for waypoints and tracks import/export. KMZ support for waypoints and tracks export, waypoints import.\n+ CSV import/export for waypoints.\n+ Voice coach to tell you active track distance and duration, current speed and altitude without need to open the app.\n+ Support for Siri shortcuts in IOS 12 for starting and stopping GPS tracks.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE. App will work in background automatically when tracking. You can use other apps while Compass 55 does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Compass 55 never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for telling you direction to a target and recording GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always lets you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless the track is being recorded.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). As quite a lot of us are using external GPS modules, app is available for wifi only iPads and iPods.\n\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Readings with the filter on are more inert than those with the filter off though. THE FILTER MUST BE ON WHEN CYCLING, JOGGING OR WALKING.\n\n3. The G-meter. Get APPROXIMATE acceleration calculated based on your speed variation. Why use the GPS G-meter: no need to keep your iPhone in a fixed position or connect it to your vehicle’s computer system, which means speed readings can be taken discreetly, for example, during a test drive. Taking a number of readings compensates lesser accuracy. Acceleration is calculated only when the filter is off. Acceleration cannot be measured near tall buildings, in the mountains or woods.\n\n4. Large, well-lit digits\n\n5. HUD (the speed is displayed in the windscreen reflection at night time or in cloudy weather)\n\n6. Background mode. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n7. Speed and acceleration graphs\n\n8. Odometer\n\n9. Altimeter\n\n10. Time, journey duration, and current stop duration. The current stop duration will be reset after 20 seconds of motion.\n\n11. See tracks on the map\n\n12. Save tracks\n\n13. Compass\n\n14. Angle of incline (inclinometer)\n\n15. Aircraft descent/climb angle\n\n16. Get detailed stats for any part of your journey\n\n17. Export your journey to a KMZ or GPX file\n\n18. Export track statistics table to a CSV file\n\n19. Load and show your route (journey plan) on the map together with a track. To do this, create a route, using a special online service (such as GPX Editor - https://www.gpxeditor.co.uk/map, The online GPX file editor - https://gpx.studio/, Track drawing websites - https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Track_drawing_websites) on your desktop, and export it as a GPX (KML, CSV) file. The file name must begin with \"Route\". Using iTunes, transfer the file into the app (OR use the \"Files\" app). Following this, you will be able to select your route at the bottom of your track list. Now you can easily travel following your route line, even without loading a map.\n\n20. Export and import files via iTunes and email\n\n21. Waypoints (description, color selection, keywords, photos, audio records)\n\n22. A single waypoint database with a filter option\n\n23. Music controls\n\n24. No annoying ads\n\n25. Vintage design \n\n\nAudio alert settings:\n• \"60! 70!! 80!!!\": One audio signal once you go over 60, a continuous signal for over 70, and another continuous (and more unpleasant) signal for over 80.\n• \"60! 70\": Detailed cues, such as \"60! 70!!\".\n• \"50!! 55. 60!!\": Continuous signal within the speed range between 50 and 55, and continuous signal for over 60.\n• \"60!!! 60.\": One signal above 60.\n• You can enter a comment at the beginning of the line, for example, \"Highway 70!!!\".\n• Type in any word without numbers (for example, \"OFF\") and use if to turn off the speed control.\n• You can upload your own WAV file with the name of the signal (for example, \"!.wav\" or \"!!!.wav\") to play your own sound. Connect your iPhone to a computer, then go to iTunes > iPhone > \"File Sharing\" > Apps. Or use the \"Files\" app.\n\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\n1. When driving past tall buildings (or in the mountains or woods) with the filter off, the device may display false speed spikes (due to an unstable satellite signal). In this case, switching the filter on may be a better option.\n\n2. Car speedometers often display a higher than actual speed, the difference sometimes reaching 10%. This is due to your wheels’ diameter. This is why at high speeds GPS speedometers can deliver better accuracy than your regular car speedometer. And the higher the speed, the more accurate your GPS speedometer is.\n\n3. Please note that temporary false readings are possible with ANY GPS speedometer when you start using it.\n\n4. Battery life (iPhone 5S, poor light outside, 100% => 20%):\nBackground mode (iPhone asleep): ~ 9 h\nSpeedometer (speed, distance): ~ 4 h\nTrack-enabled map: ~ 2 h 30 min\n\nhttps://youtu.be/92TefSsz7gY"

Up to four dash cams can be wirelessly connected with the Dash Cam Auto Sync feature to provide comprehensive coverage around a vehicle, offering various viewpoints recorded by the multiple cameras. The Garmin Drive app can create a “picture-in-picture” video from any two perspectives at the same time, making it easy to review video and also share videos with friends, insurance agencies, or legal authorities.\r\n \r\nGarmin Speak™ and Garmin DriveSmart™ 65 with Amazon Alexa are two Garmin products that bring what you love about Amazon Alexa to your vehicle. Just ask Alexa to hear music, news, and more. Also, enjoy Garmin turn-by-turn navigation. Stream the audio (music and other responses) from your vehicle’s stereo when you connect Garmin Speak to your stereo using Bluetooth® or AUX.\r\n \r\nOlder Bluetooth-capable Garmin navigators are compatible with the Garmin Smartphone Link app, and older Wi-Fi-enabled Garmin dash cams can access video footage through the Garmin VIRB app."

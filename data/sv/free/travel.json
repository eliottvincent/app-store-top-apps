      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 700 cities in 47 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

Visit our rental website at shop.takewheels.com for more information.\n\nRIDE SAFER\nWheels is dedicated to bringing safe, low-cost, environmentally-friendly transportation to communities around the world. We’ve reimagined micro-mobility to make it more accessible, safer, and more convenient than ever before. Everything we do is designed to deliver an exceptional experience for riders worldwide.\n\nWe require all riders to be at least 18 years old with a valid ID card to ride.\n\nWHY WHEELS IS SAFER AND EASIER TO USE\nWheels is more accessible than a standard bike thanks to its electric motor and pedal-less design. With its lower center of gravity and multiple touchpoints, it is safer than accident-prone scooters. Its unparalleled stability is due to a 14-inch wheel, allowing you to navigate uneven surfaces with ease. Additionally, we’ve made numerous safety-first design decisions, including dual disk brakes for better stopping power, automatic lights for high visibility anytime, a padded seat for comfort, and an integrated smart helmet system on select models. All of this makes the Wheels form factor an industry leader for safety and ease of use.\n\nWHERE TO RIDE\nRide in bike lanes when available. Please do not ride on the sidewalk. You can ride a Wheels bike as far as you want. A fully charged Wheels can ride up to 30 miles.\n\nRIDE RESPONSIBLY\nPlease do not take a Wheels bike on other forms of transportation such as cars, buses, trains, etc. Please be sure to also consider the no ride/parking zones before shutting off your bike.\n\nWHERE TO PARK\nPlease park your Wheels with respect for pedestrians and your fellow community members.\nWe encourage Wheels riders to park near public bike/scooter corrals or accessible public locations that do not cause an obstruction of the sidewalk. Wheels should never be parked in a gated location or compound, in underground parking garages, or other locations that would make it difficult for another user to access them. For the safety of others, Wheels should not be parked where they can block driveways, doors, or other pathways. \n\nWHEELS FOR ALL\nWheels for All is a discount program that provides access to an easy, equitable, and environmentally-friendly form of transportation for qualifying riders. Access to transportation is an everyday necessity. Wheels is committed to promoting equity by providing increased access to transportation to everyone. \n\nTo qualify, individuals must be currently enrolled in city, state, or federal assistance programs such as Medicaid, EBT, SNAP, or a discounted utility bill*. Program details may vary by market, but most cities offer:\n\n50% ride discount (including unlock fee)\n\n*Terms subject to change. Approval is at Wheels’ sole discretion.\n\nPARTNER WITH US\nIf you’re interested in bringing Wheels to your organization or municipality, please reach out to us at partners@wheels.co or visit our website takewheels.com/partners.\n\n\nDownload the app, and get riding today!\n\nVisit www.takewheels.com to learn more."

Flewber’s mobile application gives users the ability to share, bid, and book affordably priced private flights for all of life’s occasions.\n\nThe \"Bid\" feature allows users to bid on a flight, which sources an empty leg or other lesser priced alternatives from Flewber’s marketplace of aircraft. With the \"Bid\" button, you get up to 30% cost savings, and peace of mind in reducing your carbon footprint, by flying on aircraft that would have flown empty.\n\nThe \"Share\" feature is for those who wish to fly out of town for events, long weekends, and weddings alike, and share the cost of the flight by inviting friends to come along. Friends can simply RSVP and pay their portion of the cost directly to the user who booked the flight. Not only does this feature make saving money easy for the user, it provides everyone with inclusive access to the joys of private aviation.\n\nFor experienced private air travellers who simply want a quick and easy booking process without the need to call a private jet broker and wait for hours or days, the \"Book\" button is the fastest way to a personal aviation experience; your own plane and customized itinerary with no lines or security checkpoints.\n\nView available airports and prices and book directly through the app. Simply book your flight and arrive 15 minutes prior to take off. Tap, pack, and go!"

It is currently available to international air travellers who enter Canada at selected airports.\n\nBy submitting your customs and immigration information in advance, you will spend less time at a primary inspection kiosk (PIK) or eGate when you arrive at the airport. This contributes to shorter line-ups in arrivals halls.\n\nAt the border, you will be prompted to scan your travel document at a primary inspection device and confirm your identity. Once your identity has been confirmed, your Advance CBSA Declaration will be retrieved from ArriveCAN for you to review and certify. If changes are required, you can edit and update your declaration prior to certification.\n\nUse of the Advance CBSA Declaration feature of ArriveCAN is entirely optional.\n\nPlease refer to the accessibility notice for this app: https://www.canada.ca/en/border-services-agency/services/arrivecan.html#accessibility-notice\n\nThis app supports English, French and Spanish (as per your device’s language settings).\n\nFor more information: http://www.canada.ca/ArriveCAN"

      "label": "Quantum random exploration can change reality as you know it. The superpower behind Randonautica gives you a random location to journey to. Set your intention in your mind for what you seek, you will find. \n\nReasons to use Randonautica to generate completely random coordinates for you to travel to:\r\n\r\n\n-To go on an unexpected adventure\r\n-To test out quantum entropy and the mind's ability to influence reality\r\n-To break the matrix\r\n-To get some exercise by walking to a random location\r\n-To open a real world portal\r\n-To get off screens and go on an outdoor adventure\r\n-To feel heightened awareness and observation\r\n-To feel being present \r\n-To find new areas in your neighborhood, town or city\n\r\n-To connect with other people of similar interests across the globe on Randonautica's in-app Social Media feed, Discover\n\n\n\r\nProven:\r\n\r\n\nGoing to a random location makes you hyperaware and present, often providing a sense of meditation or the feeling of being alive again. Random exploration adds novelty to life!\r\n\r\n\nTheoretical: \n\n\r\n\r\nBy interfacing with quantum entropy there is growing evidence that the mind, thoughts, emotions and words have an impact on matter. Using Randonautica creates a bridge to access a very malleable reality. Having an intense thought or \"intention\" while the generation process is happening can result in an effect in the real world as you journey to the random coordinates provided by the app. People have reported that there is a ripple effect where their intention has lasting effect on their personal reality and observation.-To defeat feeling \"stuck\" in the day-to-day \n\nRandonautica is the first ever quantumly generated adventure game that takes you on a journey of true randomness. The adventure is yours to have and the legend will be yours to tell. Welcome, future Randonauts!\n\nThe app uses both pseudo and quantum entropy sources for randomization which provides a set of coordinates that can be opened in a map to navigate to or the user can digitally explore the coordinates. While “Blind Spots” are random points meant to be visited for exploring the unknown world around you, choosing an “Anomaly” type coordinate will run an algorithm over your radius to find the most statistically improbable distribution of random points within your radius. These are destinations where the real magic happens.\n\nExplore the world beyond the habitual and deterministic patterns of your everyday life, discover adventures right in front of your doorstep. \n\nSubscriptions:\n• Pro Subscription allows you to unlock unlimited points, setting custom location by long pressing anywhere on the map, and the new Pro Theme\n• Payment will be charged to your credit/debit card at the confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nPrivacy, Terms and Conditions:\nhttps://www.randonautica.com/terms-and-services"

      "label": "The official mobile ticketing app from San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency! The MuniMobile app lets you purchase and use fares and passes instantly on your phone—anywhere, anytime. Just download the free app, create an account and you're ready to go.\n \nWHY YOU'LL LOVE THIS APP:\n• No paper fares to keep track of.\n• No need to carry cash, count exact change, or find a ticket machine.\n• Buy and use fares using a debit/credit card, PayPal or Apple Pay\n• Store multiple tickets on your phone for future use. \n• Pay a single fare or multiple fares for a group of riders.\n• Register your debit/credit card(s) in our secure system.\n \nHOW IT WORKS:\n1. CHOOSE RIDER TYPE: Adult, Senior/Disabled/Medicare, Youth, or SF Access\n2. CHOOSE FARE: Single Trip Fare for Muni Bus & Rail, Single Ride Fare for Cable Car, or Passports\n3. CHOOSE QUANTITY: You can buy multiple tickets to use later\n4. CHECK OUT: Pay with debit/credit card, PayPal or Apple Pay\n \nCOMMON QUESTIONS:\nQ: Do I need to be connected to the Internet?\nA cellular network or a wireless Internet connection is required to purchase tickets, but you can use/activate your tickets offline. \n\nQ: What if my battery dies?\nJust like with paper tickets, you're responsible for making sure you have a valid fare at all times, so be sure to plan ahead!\n\nIMPORTANT REMINDERS:\n • Don't uninstall the MuniMobile app or erase your phone without transferring your unused tickets first. Your tickets are stored on your phone (which makes it possible to use them without a cellular network or a wireless Internet connection). Activate your ticket before boarding.\n• In the subway, activate (“use”) your purchased mobile ticket before passing through metro station fare gates. Show your active ticket to the station agent, and pass through the fare gate closest to the station agent booth. If the station agent is not present, you may still pass through the gate as long as your ticket has been activated.  Do not attempt to “tag” the gate.\n• On the surface, use your purchased mobile ticket before boarding the vehicle. You may board through any door. If you feel more comfortable boarding through the front door to show your ticket to the transit operator, please feel free to do so.\n• For Cable Car, use your purchased mobile ticket once you are on board the vehicle. Show your mobile ticket to the Cable Car conductor.\n• Watch your battery level! Just like with paper tickets, you're responsible for making sure you have a valid fare at all times.\n• Create an account before purchasing tickets, as this is the only way you can transfer your unused tickets if you get a new phone. (Note: Only unused tickets can be transferred. Use up any activated tickets before switching phones.)"

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go.

And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

With this upgrade, the app will display objects as faint as magnitude 22 (versus magnitude 8 in the base version) and enable advanced observing features.\n\nStellarium Plus features (unlocked with in-app purchase):\n\n• Reach the limit of knowledge by diving in a massive collection of stars, nebulas, galaxies, star clusters and other deep sky objects:\n  - All known stars: Gaia DR2 catalog of over 1.69 billion stars\n  - All known planets, natural satellites and comets, and many other minor solar system objects (10k asteroids)\n  - Most known deep sky objects: a combined catalog of over 2 million nebulas and galaxies\n\n• Zoom almost without limits on high resolution images of deep sky objects or planetary surfaces.\n\n• Observe in the field, even without internet connection, with a \"reduced\" set of data: 2 million stars, 2 million Deep Sky Objects, 10k asteroids.\n\n• Control your telescope through WIFI: drive any GOTO telescope compatible with NexStar, SynScan or LX200 protocols.\n\n• Prepare your observing sessions using the advanced observation tools, to predict a celestial object observability and transit times.\n\nStellarium Mobile is made by the original creator of Stellarium, the well known open source planetarium and one of the best astronomy applications on Desktop PC.\n\nYour can unlock the full features using either a one time payment or a subscription.  See In-App Purchase section for the subscription price available in your country.  Payment will be charged to your iTunes account.  Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

Take the test on your mobile device from anywhere, at any time.\n \n- EnglishScore is trusted. Every year, over two million people take international English exams and qualifications with the British Council.\n\n- EnglishScore is quick and accurate. Know your English level in as little as 30 minutes with a test designed by British Council.\n\n- EnglishScore is free to practise. Join 4.8 million English learners and take multiple practice tests for free.\n \nAbout the English test and certificate\n\nThe EnglishScore test is delivered on a mobile phone, so it requires different security measures and rules. \n\nWe use security features such as face monitoring technology through your smartphone’s selfie camera. You must be alone in a quiet place with your whole face clearly in the camera during the test.\n\nThese rules help give you and organisations confidence that your results are accurate and reliable.\n\nTo take the test and purchase a certificate, you will need to turn on your test security.\n\nOnce the test is complete, EnglishScore awards you with an internationally recognised CEFR level from A2 to C1 and a more detailed score between 0 and 599 aligned to the CEFR framework. This is a recognised global standard for describing language levels. You can use your CEFR score to compare results with tests such as IELTS, TOEIC and TOEFL.\n\nThe British Council EnglishScore Professional Certificate is recognised by leading employers and education institutions around the world.\n\nYou can use a Professional Certificate to help advance your career, including applying for a job or to enhance your CV.\n\nEnglishScore is also available for businesses, universities and colleges that are looking to conduct English tests at scale.

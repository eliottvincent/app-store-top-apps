The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

Visit records will be automatically removed after 31 days.\n\nIf there is confirmed case in a venue located in Hong Kong, the mobile app will notify those users who have visited the same venue at the same time with the infected person(s), thus increasing vigilance and self-protection awareness of citizens as well as enhancing public confidence in visiting different venues.\n\nUpon confirmation by Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, app users who are confirmed positive or preliminary positive of COVID-19 infection can share their visit history with the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health to help trace the relevant contacts.\n\nThe mobile app allows the app users to store their Vaccine Pass records (e.g. COVID-19 vaccination records, vaccination medical exemption certificate and recovery record, provisional vaccine pass) and testing record. The mobile app automatic displays the app users selected Vaccine Pass QR code after scanning a venue QR code to facilitate the compliance with the “Vaccine Pass” measure. The Vaccine Pass QR code stored in the mobile app will be changed to red color if it is belonged to a COVID-19 infected person, and to amber code if it is belonged to a person under medical surveillance according to Department of Health’s records for the purpose of fighting the pandemic.\n\nThe mobile app also provides a Testing Registration Code function to enable app users to voluntarily store their personal information in advance. This function aims to reduce the time spent on queuing on-site and registration at testing points through a simplified registration process for app users to conduct COVID-19 nucleic acid testing if needed.\n\nThe LeaveHomeSafe mobile app is developed under the supervision by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/privacy \nPersonal Information Collection Statement: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/personal-information-collection-statement"

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

The better you understand how well you are sleeping the more you are able to make changes in your routines to benefit your rest.  \n\nMy goal is to provide every Apple Watch owner with a free automatic sleep tracker that is simple and clear to understand.  For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

Athlytic even has a proprietary Effort Score on a 0-10 scale to see how far you’ve pushed yourself. It also coaches you to tell you how far off of your PR or average the Effort was for each type of workout type.\n\nNotes:\n• Athlytic does not require an Apple Watch, however for most of the features such as Recovery and Exertion Levels, you will need an Apple Watch in order to collect HRV and Resting Heart Rate Data necessary for these features.\n• Athlytic integrates with the Health App on your iPhone to retrieve the data it displays. It will request permission to access the relevant data types necessary to present the metrics and features in the app.\n\nInformation about Athlytic subscriptions:\n- Subscribers will receive 1 week free of Athlytic\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n- Your subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n- Depending on what subscription length you choose (Monthly or Annually), so long as your subscription is active, you will have access to the entire iPhone app for these periods, respectfully.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.

      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier. Install the Dr. Kegel app to amaze your partner, stay confident & be happy. Install now & you won’t regret it!\r\n\r\nWe offer a wide range of subscription options.

You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases.

      "label": "TrackMyGolf delivers a golf swing analyzer right on your wrist. Watch your golf swing at up to 100 samples per second, as captured by the built-in motion sensors of your Apple Watch. There’s no extra hardware to buy (similar products sell for up to $150).\nAn Apple Watch is required in order to capture your golf swing analysis.\n\nTrackMyGolf Golf Swing Analyzer Features:\n\n- Find out your golf swing power and speed measured in MPH (speed measured is hand swing speed, not club head speed)\n- Visualize your golf swing form in 3D \n- Rotate view in any direction to look at your golf swing from any angle\n- Up to 100 samples/second so that you can see details no human eye can capture\n- A number of data reported including hand swing speed, tempo, swing plane, impact angle, swing path, grip angle, and golf swing power.\n- Swing data stored in the cloud so that you can revisit at any time\n- No Internet connection required during swing. Your golf swing analysis saved to cloud when the phone is connected to the Internet later.\n- Support both left-handed & right-handed golfer\n\nThis golf swing trainer tool is extremely helpful in visualizing your arm movement through the swing. For example, you can visualize how your arm cross over through the impact zone. Another use of the Apple Watch golf swing reader, if you tend to cast early, you can visualize your arm pushing out and swinging outside in to compensate.\n\nAdvantages compared to other golf swing analyzers on the market:\n\n- No hardware to buy, just use your Apple Watch. Other analyzers cost $150+\n- No calibration, no set up. Start the golf swing trainer app and play. \n- No switching. No need to switch the sensor when you switch the golf club.\n- No extra weight. Nothing is attached to the shaft, so your golf swing power and form are never affected. You can even use it on the golf course to capture your game swings.\n\nPlease make sure you sign in to iCloud on your phone. This app stores your swing in iCloud so that you can visualize it on phone and review later. \n\nLimitations: Because the sensor location is on your wrist, you will not see problems associated with your hand. For example, if you flip your hand or un-hinge too early, you will not be able to visualize the problem. However, a hand flip is usually a result of compensating for an early arm casting, so you can get a hint from your arm trajectory.\n\nWe appreciate your feedbacks. If you see a problem or have a suggestion, please do not just leave a negative rating (yes 4* is a bad rating, we have a high standard :-)), because we have no idea why. Tell us the problem so that we can improve the product. Better yet, email us directly at support@vimo.co. Like other reviews have mentioned, we provide a speedy support, we typically respond within 30 minutes.\n\nThe watch app will invoke HealthKit API to request starting a golf workout session when you click \"start session\" on the watch interface. \n\n** Watch OS3 is required for this app. If it is not showing on your watch, go to Apple Watch app on Phone, choose \"General->Software Update\" and follow instructions. **\n** You need to sign in to iCloud. All swings are stored in your iCloud account. No swing will show if you do not connect an iCloud account **\n** Turn off sensors afterwards to save battery, by Force Touch, then choose \"End Session\" **"

      "label": "The Free Shot Timer is an extremely accurate shot timer application that anyone can use to improve their shooting skills.\n     When designing the Free Shot Timer we asked shooters of all types and experience levels what they wanted in a timer. We found that the most important features in a shot timer from the shooter’s perspective are ACCURACY and EASE OF OPERATION. The last thing people want to do at the range is mess around with their timer, but at the same time they want it to work.\n     With that in mind we engineered a shot timer app that has the precision of a high dollar stand-alone unit, with an incredibly user-friendly interface. But we didn’t stop there…\n\n\nOther Features:\n\nAdjustable Start Delay (0-4 seconds).\n\nRandom Start Delay (randomly starts the timer 2-5 seconds after the start button is pressed).\n\nAdjustable Par Time (0-99.99 seconds). \n\nExtra Loud Start Beep, designed to be heard through ear protection.\n\nLarge, easy to read numerical display.\n\nSave shot data to view later.\n\nEmail shot data.\n\nPrint shot data right from your device using AirPrint."

Avoid areas where glare from lights and windows may the affect detection of shots on the targets. \n-    Place your smartphone on the tripod and point the rear camera at the target(s) you have placed. \n-    If you are using a laser cartridge, load the laser cartridge into the chamber of your firearm. \n-    Launch the Mantis Laser Academy app on your phone, select a drill, and proceed to train.\n\nDRILLS and SMART TARGETS:\nThe Mantis Laser Academy app has a variety of drills focused on different aspects of shooting. Some drills require specific smart targets. Other drills work with any smart target. Several drills support multiple targets and allow local competition between shooters.\n\nSmart targets are automatically detected and scored by Mantis Laser Academy. Using smart targets provides the most enjoyable and valuable training experience. The Control Target allows you to Start, Stop, Clear, and Close in the app by shooting specific regions on the Control Target.\n\nMantis Laser Academy has a selection of free drills and a selection of drills that can be purchased or unlocked. You can purchase a single drill or Full Access in the app.\n\nOur mission is to help every shooter improve their accuracy and confidence.

      "label": "Golfboy is a golf ball trajectory measurement application. \nIt can be used by anyone as long as they have an iPhone and a tripod (see iPhone model requirements below).\nIt uses image analysis technology to measure flying distance, ball speed, launch angle, club speed, etc. in real time.\nIt also has a course simulation function for more realistic practice.\nPutt measurement and automatic recording of swing videos are also available to support all kinds of golf training.\n\nGolfboy uses our self-developed sports analysis technology to make golf more fun and efficient for the general public. Golfboy has been tested against laser-based distance measuring devices already on the market, and accuracy has been improved to the point where it can be used in practice, to take your golf  to the next level.\n\n+ Golfboy is a great way to improve your golf.\n+ It is useful for getting a feel for the distance and trajectory of your shots.\n+ You can use the app not only at an outdoor driving range, but also indoors or on the course.\n+ If you're practicing with a friend,you can use two iPhones and the included pairing function to automatically capture your swing video with shot data on it.\n+ In \"Round mode\", you can  use Golfboy's original virtual courses to simulate practicing on a real course.\nThe \"Form mode\" is available on iPhoneSE2 and iPhone11 or later.\nGolfboy can measure different distances depending on the lens used on the iPhone.\n\n+ In the case of iPhones with ultra wide angle lenses (assuming the use of a tripod at a height of 4.0ft[1.2m]) It is possible to measure distances of up to 280 yards.\n\n+ If your iPhone does not have the ultra wide angle lens (assuming you use a tripod at a height of 4.0ft[1.2m]),\nthe distance can be measured up to 220yd.\n\nThe distance can be increased by raising the height of the tripod.\nIf the lighting is too dark or it is difficult to distinguish the color of the ball from the background, the measurement may not be possible. Please check the operation in your preferred environment during the free trial period.\n\nAbout subscription\nGolfboy is free to download, but you will need to register for a subscription to use the measurement functions.\nFor first time users, there is a two month free trial, after which you will be asked to pay a set fee based on your country of residence as indicated in the app.\nYour subscription will be automatically renewed if not cancelled within 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n+ Features provided with the subscription\n1) Ball trajectory measurement function by \"Shot mode\"\n2) \"Putt mode\" to measure ball trajectory in a putting scenario.\n3) Course simulation function in \"Round mode\"\n4) Swing video comparison and history management function in \"Form mode\"\n\"Form mode\" is only available on iPhoneSE2 and iPhone11 or later.\n\nWhile your subscription is active, you can use the above features as many times as you like with no limit.\nGolfboy can also be used to check your past practice records, as it keeps a log of your past shots and swing data.\nGolfboy will help you maximize your potential in golf by visualizing your shot data.\n\nYou will not be able to access your past practice records after your subscription ends, so please export the records you need during your subscription period by using the share function, posting them to SNS, or saving them on your device.\n\nTerms of Use and Privacy Policy\nYou can check the terms of use and privacy policy in the app.\n\nIf you need support\nPlease contact us at contact@qonceptstl.com."

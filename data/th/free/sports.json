      "label": "• This app IS NOT a game\n• This app requires the Ianseo archery competition software to function properly\n \nIANSEO Scorekeeper is an archery scoring app and is the only app that is fully integrated with the Ianseo archery software. Extend your competitions to include scoring directly at the target and provide real-time results after each end! Using wireless communication, the app always has direct contact with Ianseo to save and retrieve scores. Take your competitions to the next level.\n \nScorekeeper provides scoring for:\n• Indoor Target Archery\n• Outdoor Target Archery\n• Field Archery\n• 3D Archery\n \nThe app handles scoring for qualification rounds, elimination rounds, individual matches and team matches. Information is clearly displayed showing archer name/country, target placement, end number, target type and number of arrows to be scored. Archers can easily enter scores per end using the large scoring buttons. Swiping the screen provides a quick and easy way to navigate between archers and ends. An electronic scorecard is available to see all arrows shot, end totals, distance totals, and a running total for the whole competition. Online help is available directly in the app.\n \nSetup is a breeze using the QR-codes provided by Ianseo on the printable scorecards. A single scan of the code provides all the information needed to set up the the device. Score multiple targets with the same device. The app is translated into multiple languages and new languages are available for download directly from Ianseo.\n\n\nWhat is Ianseo?\nIanseo is a software for managing the results of an Archery Tournament; it is an Open Source Project developed thanks to the Italian Archery Federation's financial support, that decided to freely distribute it in whole Europe. Translated in several languages, Ianseo is the most up to date and advanced in the world integrating all the World Archery rules, but has evolved to include a comprehensive management of an Archery Tournament as a whole: from accreditation of the athletes and officers to every kind of printouts utilities, from network and online integration to field-of-play design."

We found that the most important features in a shot timer from the shooter’s perspective are ACCURACY and EASE OF OPERATION. The last thing people want to do at the range is mess around with their timer, but at the same time they want it to work.\n     With that in mind we engineered a shot timer app that has the precision of a high dollar stand-alone unit, with an incredibly user-friendly interface. But we didn’t stop there…\n\n\nOther Features:\n\nAdjustable Start Delay (0-4 seconds).\n\nRandom Start Delay (randomly starts the timer 2-5 seconds after the start button is pressed).\n\nAdjustable Par Time (0-99.99 seconds). \n\nExtra Loud Start Beep, designed to be heard through ear protection.\n\nLarge, easy to read numerical display.\n\nSave shot data to view later.\n\nEmail shot data.\n\nPrint shot data right from your device using AirPrint."

      "label": "Golf’s first Artificial Intelligence platform, the Arccos Caddie app syncs with Arccos Caddie sensors to automatically track your shots while delivering Smart Distance club averages and game insights. The system also includes an A.I. powered GPS rangefinder and caddie advice for any hole on earth to help golfers of all skill levels make smarter decisions, improve faster and shoot lower scores.\n\nIn 2020, new Arccos Caddie members improved their handicap by a remarkable 5.02 strokes! \n\nThe winner of five-straight Golf Digest Editors’ Choice Awards (2016-2020), Arccos Caddie now features Strokes Gained Analytics (SGA). Providing players with the most advanced personalized insights in the game, SGA is the first platform to allow a player to select any target handicap – from Tour player to 20 – and measure their performance versus that goal across every game facet. SGA not only supports deep dives for all performance segments by each round or customizable periods, it automatically highlights a player’s top-3 strengths and weaknesses and provides tips from world-class instructors. \n\nFor golfers who prefer to prefer to play without having to carry a smartphone, Arccos Caddie Link is a perfect solution. This small, ultralight wearable allows Arccos players to capture their shot data without having to carry a smartphone on the course. Link seamlessly pairs with the Arccos Caddie app and sensors. Worn on a player’s belt, waistband or pocket, it tracks shots in real time – including the club used and precise location – and automatically transfers the data to a player’s smartphone via Bluetooth, either during or after the round. This allows golfers to play the game their way, freeing them to keep their phone in a cart, bag, back pocket or elsewhere.\n\n\nThe ideal way for players, coaches and clubfitters to dial improve decision-making, inform practice regimens and dial-in equipment choices, key Arccos Caddie features include:\n   - Automatic Shot Tracking\n   - Smart Distance Club Averages\n   - A.I. Powered GPS Rangefinder\n   - A.I. Caddie Advice (developed in partnership with Microsoft)\n   - Strokes Gained Analytics \n\nThe Arccos Caddie app works with Arccos Caddie Smart Sensors, and Arccos Caddie Smart Grips as well as a wide range of PING and Cobra golf clubs that come standard with Arccos Caddie sensors embedded in the grip (PING G710 and G425 clubs, and every club in the KING Cobra line). Arccos also has official partnerships with TaylorMade Golf, Club Champion, TXG and Cool Clubs.\n\n\nThe world’s most-used on-course golf app, Arccos Caddie has hundreds of thousands of registered users who have played millions of rounds and taken hundreds of millions of shots. Arccos Caddie also offers a tournament mode that Conforms to the Rules of Golf (USGA Decision #2017-0754).\n\n\n\nThe Arccos Caddie app uses the iPhone's GPS at the highest level of accuracy which can have an impact on battery usage.\n\nThe Arccos Caddie app supports Apple Watch and uses HealthKit to create a golf workout while you are playing golf.\n\nArccos End User License Agreement: https://www.arccosgolf.com/pages/end-user-license-agreement"

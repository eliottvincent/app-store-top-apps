You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad. No special basketballs, uncomfortable sensors, or expensive equipment is required. Just set up your phone with a clear view of the court and starting training and competing through HomeCourt.\n\nPRICING\n• Free: Access the full library of 100+ drills and activities. Get unlimited shot tracking.\n• HomeCourt Plus: Access your full workout history, get complete skill ratings, join the members-only training club, request feedback from HomeCourt pro trainers, participate in HomeCourt Global Camp, and create up to 4 user profiles.\n\nHomeCourt Plus is available for subscription as either monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions.

      "label": "Golf GPS is a simple app.  It tells distance to bunkers, water hazards, and pins.  Many similar apps requires subscription (hopefully no additional cost) , or you need to build your own map ahead of time.  While struggling with my terrible iron shot, I got an idea.  When you play golf, you see red, white, blue yardage represents 100, 150 and 200 yards respectively from the pin.  The idea was why don’t I reverse it on my iPhone screen.\n\nIt draws a map around you, and put blue pin where you are.  And draw red, white, blue circle around you.  Since I can add circle easily, I add three more: 50, 250 & 300 yard.  For those who are familiar with meter, I add an option for you.\n\nThose circle should be enough for most player while the app allows you to drop yardage wherever you want.  Drop and drag it to a point you want, and it will tell exact distance from your location.  Those yardages will be stored internally and will be displayed again until you delete it.\n\n\n*** You need internet connection to use this app ***\n\nFeatures\n\n- It works any courses as long as you have internet connection \n- Distance circles around your current location: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 \n- Support both yard and meter \n- 10-yard(meter) circles when you zoom in \n- Drop yardages wherever you want to know exact distance \n- Relocate yardages by drag & drop \n- App saves yardages for later play \n- Compass view (rotate map) to match the direction you are facing; easy to find green \n- Yardages in 3 different sizes \n- Support background mode for quick restart \n- More yardage circles when zoom closely for accuracy \n- Drop a marker (shot from)  where you hit and calculate distance from it\n- Purchase option to remove ads and enable Marker History View, which allows you to review your mark (short from) history after a game"

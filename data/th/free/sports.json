      "label": "The Free Shot Timer is an extremely accurate shot timer application that anyone can use to improve their shooting skills.\n     When designing the Free Shot Timer we asked shooters of all types and experience levels what they wanted in a timer. We found that the most important features in a shot timer from the shooter’s perspective are ACCURACY and EASE OF OPERATION. The last thing people want to do at the range is mess around with their timer, but at the same time they want it to work.\n     With that in mind we engineered a shot timer app that has the precision of a high dollar stand-alone unit, with an incredibly user-friendly interface. But we didn’t stop there…\n\n\nOther Features:\n\nAdjustable Start Delay (0-4 seconds).\n\nRandom Start Delay (randomly starts the timer 2-5 seconds after the start button is pressed).\n\nAdjustable Par Time (0-99.99 seconds). \n\nExtra Loud Start Beep, designed to be heard through ear protection.\n\nLarge, easy to read numerical display.\n\nSave shot data to view later.\n\nEmail shot data.\n\nPrint shot data right from your device using AirPrint."

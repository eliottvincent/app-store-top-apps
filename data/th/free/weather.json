Sundial puts solar and lunar information into the palm of your hand and, thanks to the Apple Watch app, onto your wrist as well!\n\nSundial is an app designed to give everyone access to the sun and moon in ways they don't normally have it. Perfect for runners, hikers, campers, boaters, sailors, pilots, gardeners, farmers, photographers, film/tv production crew, astronomers, astrophotographers, solar installers, and travelers of all kinds. Sundial is an app for anyone who just needs to know when it'll get light and dark.\n\nSundial provides a one-of-a-kind display of the sun and moon's rise and set cycle over the 24-hour day. As the seasons change, the yellow Òsun is outÓ arc informs you of the precious daylight hours, shrinking during winter months and expanding as summer approaches. The white inner arc represents when the moon is visible in the sky. Civil, nautical, and astronomical twilights are also shown on the solar dial in shades of blue.\n\nCreate alerts for one of 24 different solar and lunar events and Sundial will tell you about them Ð without you ever having to open the app.\n\nThe 24 events that support notifications include:\n\n- Sunrise, solar mid-morning, solar noon, solar mid-afternoon, sunset, and solar midnight\n- Civil twilight (dawn/dusk), nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight\n- Moonrise, lunar noon, moonset, and lunar midnight\n- Moon phases: full moon, new moon, first quarter moon, and last quarter moon\n- Astronomical seasons: March equinox, June solstice, September equinox, and December solstice\n\nAll notifications can be customized to alert you minutes, hours, and even days before an event takes place. Sundial can give you plenty of notice that you need to be ready for a sunrise, sunset, and more. Like to walk your dog for 30 minutes before dusk? Sundial can help you with that!\n\nThere's more, too!\n\nTIME TRAVEL\n\nUse Sundial's 24-hour wheel to see where the sun and moon will be today, tomorrow, and any other time you choose. Use gestures on iPhone and iPad to scroll through dates. Or jump to a specific date with iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nSundial features 35 different home and lock screen widgets. Most are customizable.\n\nAPPLE WATCH APP\n\nThe Sundial Apple Watch app makes all of its solar and lunar data available where it's most easily found Ð right on your wrist. Because Sundial runs on your watch you won't even need to have your iPhone with you.\n\nHundreds of complication combinations mean you'll find one that displays the right data and has the right look Ð even for the most custom of watch faces. Sundial's unique time dials, solar times/countdown, lunar times/countdown, moon phase, and solar/lunar azimuth are all present on Apple Watch.\n\nACCESSIBILITY\n\nWe want to make sure everyone can enjoy Sundial which is why we built in full Voice Over support from the ground up.\n\nPRIVACY\n\nWe believe that your data is your own.

The app caches the last acquired forecast for up to 24 hours, allowing you to hike or run outside the network (or go running or biking with a wifi-only Apple Watch) and still see the most recently fetched data. The data refreshes automatically once a connection is available.\n\nWeathegraph cares about your privacy. No ads, no tracking, and no sharing of locations with third parties. This is how I want all the apps on my phone & watch to behave.\n\nThe hourly forecast is updated every hour, nowcast and rain alerts update every 15 minutes. If rain or snow is expected during the next 3 hours, you will get a notice on a widget (iPhone, iPad & Mac), a large complication (Watch), and a detailed 3-hour precipitation chart in the app.\nNowcast and alerts are powered by Foreca and depend on the precision of rain radars in your area.\n\nYou can unlock professional Apple Weather, Foreca, Open-Meteo, and Dark Sky forecast sources, weather alerts, nowcast, and all styles and options via a reasonably priced subscription, which covers the cost of data and allows me to further improve Weathergraph. One-time Weathergraph Forever unlock is also available.\nThank you for your support!\n\nIf you liked Dark Sky, Weather Line, Weathertron, or Weather Strip, then Weathergraph might be the best replacement :).\n\nPrivacy policy and terms of use:\nhttps://weathergraph.app/privacy\n\nPlease note:\nSubscriptions made on Apple devices will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account. Your subscription will automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to cancel once activated. Manage or turn off your subscriptions in App Store app > Account > Subscriptions."

Handy when you are about to travel somewhere and want to get a heads up on the UV radiation level where you are going.\n\nWidget:\niOS 14 home screen widgets are now supported. Choose between 7 different home screen widgets, and add them to either you Home Screen or the Today screen.\n\nNotifications:\nThe app can notify you when the UV Index goes above a certain level. Set the desired UV Index you wish to be notified about, and you will receive a notification if the UV Index at your location goes over this treshold.

      "label": "Air Quality Index (AQI) is increasing day by day and the impact is affecting the climate a lot. The change in the weather condition has worsened air quality.\n\n• Air is the Earth's atmosphere. Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear gas in which living things live and breathe. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no colour or smell. It has mass and weight, because it is matter. The weight of air creates atmospheric pressure. There is no air in outer space. \n• Air is a mixture of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and very small amounts of other gases.\n• Air can be polluted by some gases (such as carbon monoxide), smoke, and ash. This air pollution causes various problems including smog, acid rain and global warming. It can damage people's health.\n• The Air Quality data sources varies depending on the cities.\n\n\n\nPLACES:\n- Store favourite places to find out Air Quality Info easily.\n- Easy to navigate to the bookmarked places and find pollution level instantly.\n\n\nMAP: \n- You can check all the near by City’s Air Quality Index on Map\n- Providing the Air Quality info city wise.\n- Plan your visit based on the good AQI for the specific city.\n\n\nWEATHER:\n- Show weather conditions for the current place.\n- Show sunrise and sunset time.\n\n\nNEWS:\n- Get up to date with latest Air Quality Data and Air Pollution news using Google News.\n- The latest News provides option for planning the journey for any new places based on pollution levels.\n\n\nAIR QUALITY INDEX CHART: \n- You can check the range of quality indexes and info about Index is good or bad\n- Distinguish between different indexes with color so the user can easily understand the level of pollution.\n\n\nCOUNTRY LIST: \n- You can check the country list and select your city to get the AQI info\n- Providing the country name and flag so easily identify and fid the top cities for the selected country.\n\n\nProviding below gases information in Air using this app: - CO (Carbon Oxide) \n- NO2 (Nitrogen dioxide)\n- O3 (Ozon)\n- PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter)\n- PM25 (particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter)\n- SO2 (Sulfer dioxide)\n- T \n- W\n- WG \n- H (Hydrogen)\n- DEW (Hydrocarbon Dew)\n\n\n\nAQI LEVELS DEFINITION:\n\n• Green: AQI (0 - 50) | Good\nAir quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk\n\n• Yellow: AQI\t(51 -100) | Moderate\nAir quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.\n\n• Orange: AQI\t(101-150) | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\nMembers of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected.\n\n• Red: AQI (151-200) | Unhealthy\nEveryone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects\n\n• Purple: AQI (201-300)\t| Very Unhealthy\nHealth warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected.\n\n• Brown: AQI 300+\t| Hazardous\nHealth alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects"

It takes full advantage of the iPad’s size and looks great. The addition of the hidden activities within the story make it a fun app that my son really enjoyed\n-The iPhone Mom\n\nExperience Jack and the Beanstalk like never before in this wonderfully illustrated storybook, featuring over 30 pages of interactivity which your child will enjoy. This timeless tale comes alive with audio narration, read-along text, and interactive games and features. Each page contains a hidden surprise! Come and dive into the pages of Jack and the Beanstalk and join Jack in his adventure to defeat the giant!\n\nSPOILER WARNING - Don't read this next section if you want to discover all the great surprises in this app on your own!\n\nAll 32 pages are interactive, but here are some highlights you won't want to miss.\n\nPage 1\nTilt the application to watch the sun move. Move the sun with your finger below the mountains and observe day turn to night. Touch the house to watch and hear the chimney puff.\n\nPage 6\nTouch the beans to play the memory matching game.\n\nPage 13\nMagically finger-paint the black -and-white page. When most of the image has been painted, stars will burst with enchanting sounds, and reveal an amazingly vivid image. When the page is in color, touch the lake to play a popup game. Shake the device to either finish the painting or to restart painting again.\n\nPage 14\nTouch Jack to get him to sing. It may take a few times...he's shy!\n\nPage 29\nThe Giant is high on the beanstalk. Tilt the device and watch the Giant sway. The Giant will complain when you shake the device - he's afraid of heights."

      "label": "\"Editor´s Choice Award\" by Children´s Technology Review for Excellence in Design! \n\nwired.com: \"It’s not quite a storybook, and not quite a video game. It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\n“CHOMP by Christoph Niemann” is the latest imagination from internationally renowned children’s author and illustrator Christoph Niemann, whose App ‘Petting Zoo’ is already loved by millions of children and families around the world.\n\n‘CHOMP’ combines playful, humorous, and lovingly hand-drawn animations with live video, enabling children and adults alike to slip into a variety of comical roles. From a virtuous pianist, to a spaghetti-slurping dog, or a living cuckoo-clock, anything is possible!\n\nWhat makes this App so inspiring and special is that children participate using their own faces, mimicry, and song, allowing their creativity to run free.\n\nWith the video functions, all of these adventures can be saved forever. ‘CHOMP’ is so easy and intuitive to use that kids can create and sing their own personal messages to send to parents, grandparents, friends, or siblings, all in the blink of an eye.\n\nHighlights :\n\n•\tHand drawn animations made with love and care.\n•\tOver 50 hand-drawn scenes with countless funny animations.\n•\tFun for all ages.\n•\tNo language knowledge needed. The app is text-free.\n•\tNo in-app purchases, invasive advertising, or data mining.\n•\tRecord play sessions with integrated video recording.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n•\tChildren can swipe left and right to change animations. Tap the screen to see the fun.\n•\tGrownups can open the camera menu in the bottom left to record videos. Tap to microphone icon to enable sound recording, use the large center button to start and stop video recording.\n•\tPlease enable camera permissions when prompted.\n\nJust as with his App ‘Petting Zoo’ and his New York Times blog ‘Abstract City’, Christoph Niemann uses ‘CHOMP’ to once again show us his own unique, absurd, and always funny view of the world.\n\nPress reviews:\n\nwired.com:\n\"It’s not quite a storybook, and not quite a video game. It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\nPlease also check out our other great App for kids:\n\n“PETTING ZOO” - is a fantastic storybook app. It features beautiful, fun, interactive animations of over 20 animals, and it’s bound to be a big favorite for kids and animal lovers of all ages.\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

The Jesus Calling App is the mobile version of the time-tested classic packed with digital features that make this daily devotional more accessible than ever:\n\n  * Full devotional text and fully written-out Scriptures\n  * Search by keyword, date, topic, and verse\n  * Share devotional excerpts and inspirational quotes on social media\n  * Functions as a prayer journal app – keep notes for each devotion\n  * Shop for other Sarah Young devotions inside the app\n  * Easy access to the Jesus Calling community – free podcasts, blogs, and more\n\nExperience a deeper relationship with Jesus as you savor the presence of the One who understands you perfectly and loves you forever. With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

Sandra Boynton’s best-selling book of all time comes alive with sound and movement and gloriously unpredictable interactivity. The wryly inventive Moo, Baa, La La La! digital book app will intrigue and amuse little kids and big people alike, and perhaps even elicit an appreciative snort from the occasional uninvited rhinoceros. \n\n“This is my second digital book project with the perfectly wonderful team at Loud Crow,” says Sandra Boynton, “and I’m really happy with what we’ve created together. As with The Going to Bed Book, our interactive book app version of Moo, Baa, La La La! succeeds in retaining the original board book experience, while adding multi-sensory dimension. It’s such a cool enterprise.” \n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Moo, Baa, La La La! interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery. Of course you can hear each animal make its unique sound. (In some cases, VERY unique.) But there’s more! Help the perplexed chicken stagehand raise the curtain on a stageful of dapper dancing pigs. Turn day to night with the touch of the moon. Slingshot the running cats away from the barking dogs. A touch of the duck activates a quack which brings in another duck. And another. And another. Even the back cover has a curiously articulate spokesman that you really mustn’t miss. \n\nFeatures:  \n\n* The second Boynton Moo Media book app (following their top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app), venturing far beyond what an e-book experience can offer\n * Touch the animals to hear them moo or oink or quack or even, in the case of three incongruous showbiz pigs, harmonize \n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations for her most popular book ever, Moo, Baa, La La La! (over 5 million in print!) \n* Includes an original instrumental soundtrack, \"Country Air\"; a wonderful uptempo pastoral string quartet written by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book \n* \"The Big Guy Reads It\"; with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” and hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

      "label": "** Children's Technology Review Editor's Choice\n\n“OOPS…” Blue Hat, Green Hat, Sandra Boynton’s famous and funny book, comes alive with sound and zestily ingenious interactivity. This wonderfully clever digital book app will surprise kids and grownups alike. Turkeys may also enjoy it, if they can ever figure out how to turn the dang thing on.\n\nThree earnest animals and one misguided turkey learn colors and clothes. Though admittedly, the turkey never quite gets the hang of it.\n\n“I have a particular fondness for Blue Hat, Green Hat. At age three, my son Devin had a surprisingly hearty laugh for a small person—a laugh that would make everyone else laugh. I created this book long ago specifically to elicit that belly-laugh from him. It was great fun to re-invent this book as an interactive e-book app, collaborating again with my endlessly clever Loud Crow friends. The digital dimension gave us so many terrific opportunities for adding theatrical flair to this spare yet decidedly Vaudeville book.” - Sandra Boynton\n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Blue Hat, Green Hat interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery.\n\nThe third Sandra Boynton book app, all of them created in collaboration between Boynton Moo Media along with the award-winning developer Loud Crow Interactive. Blue Hat, Green Hat follows their wonderful top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app, and the glorious bestselling Moo, Baa, La La La! app\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Touch the animals to prompt them to move and respond.\n* Touch “OOPS” to cause a different surprise on each page.\n* Tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade.\n* Dress the turkey with colorful pop-in/pop-out clothes\n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations, and also added new touch-animations\n* Wonderful resonant and wry narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer\n* Includes a original sounds and soundtrack, “William Mattel Overture,” a melody for toy crank-guitar, written by Sandra Boynton, performed by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book\n* “The Big Guy Reads It” narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” to hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

I can confirm it as I learned English by reading books myself and met many people who also did so.\n\n– About the app:\n\nThe app allows you to read books and translate unfamiliar words with a single tap. It is infinitely more convenient than copying every word to a separate translator app.\n\nNo need to make word cards with the words you don't know and put any effort in memorizing them. Just keep reading and whenever you encounter an unfamiliar word - translate it. After doing so for about 3-5 times you will memorize the word.\n\nYou can look up a word's definition using one of the dictionaries available in iOS and translate whole sentences and bigger pieces of text as well.\n\nIt is also possible to save translations as favourites. It can be useful for some rare or fascinating words.\n\nThe app itself is quality made and boasts a simple easy-to-use interface, high stability and performance. It has all the necessary features and settings for comfortable reading.\n\n– Available languages:\n\nYou can use the app to learn the following languages:\nEnglish, Español, Français, Русский, Deutsch, Italiano, Nederlands, Ελληνικά, Dansk, Norsk, Polski, Português, Türkçe, Svenska, Slovenčina, Suomi, Čeština, Magyar, Română, Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, עִבְרִית, 中文, 한국어, 日本語, ภาษาไทย, العربية.\n\n– Supported e-book formats:\n\nAt the moment, PDF, EPUB, FB2 and TXT e-books are supported.\nThe app is in active development and new formats are being added.\n\n– Recommendations:\n\nEven if you have just basic language skills start reading simple children's books now and after only a week(!) of consistent reading you will be amazed by the progress you've made. After a few months, or even sooner, you will be able to read fluently barely using the translation feature.\n\nAs a further step, аfter you feel like you can read freely enough, start watching movies in the language you learn with subtitles in the same language. It is an incredible way to improve your speech perception ability.\n\nYou will be surprised, but the words, phrases and language patterns you memorized will allow you to communicate with natives without any problem.\nIf you think about it, that is what children do when they learn their first language - they simply absorb language around them and then reproduce it. You can do it too.\n\n- Summary\n\nToday this incredible app makes it possible to easily master a language and it costs even less than one hour lesson with a private teacher. Don't miss it.\n\nKnowing more languages gives you a vast variety of new opportunities which can significantly improve your life. If you can start learning now - do it. You will thank yourself later :) \n\n– Support\n\nIf you have a question or an issue with the app please email me at\nbukus.app@gmail.com\n\nAlso feel free to send me your comments and suggestions. Together we can make it perfect :)"

Our interactive book app version of my book manages to both retain the original board book experience, and add subtle and captivating dimension to it. It’s such wonderful fun. And oh! I am so smitten by Billy J. Kramer’s infinitely reassuring narration for this, and Michael Ford’s understated and lovely piano composition.” - Sandra Boynton \n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, The Going to Bed Book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and thoroughly mesmerizing and delightful discovery.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Imagine! An ark that rocks.\n\n* Touch, pull, and turn animals and objects to make them move, or tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade \n\n* Tap water that turns on and off, and steam that fogs the screen. Can you write your name in the steam? Of course!\n\n* There are teeth to brush, and a group exercise session with ten pajama-clad animals (big and small) each with its own unique exercise.\n\n* Help the little piggy turn off the lights, then rock yourself to sleep to the music box sound of beautiful twinkling stars.\n\n* There's something wonderful to discover on every page.\n\n* \"The Big Guy Reads It\" narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills \n\n* Or “I want to read it myself” and hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\n* Wonderful resonant and gentle narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer \n\n* Boynton’s original text and illustrations for her popular The Going to Bed Book (over 5 million in print!) \n\nBoynton adds, “Of course The Going to Bed Book app is first and foremost for children, and I know they will be captivated and delighted.

Don’t worry, all the books that are pre-loaded into the app are age appropriate.\n• Have a teen who wants to learn to speed read? Want to learn yourself? Check out the full version of QuickReader.\n\n************\nSee what others are saying:\n\n\"Quickreader For Young Readers is an amazing app, that enables you to drastically improve your reading and focusing speed, while allowing you to read and download your favorite books, plus hundreds of other ones.

If it helped me, it can help you!\"\nAdrianna Zambrano, age 11\n\n“As a teacher I find this app is a great tool to help my students improve their oral reading fluency. There is a wide variety of books, something for everyone. I would use \"Quickreader- Young Readers\" with all students from 4th grade and beyond. The material is too advanced and the speed too high for any younger readers.”\nMrs. James – Customer review\n\n“…a much-needed breath of fresh air to the world of speed reading apps.” \nReadWriteWeb (http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/quickreader_iphone_app_teaches_you_to_read_faster.php)\n\n\"… a speed-reading tool that can produce remarkable results. I was shocked by the rate at which my speed improved.

      "label": "Nature has provided a veritable magical pantry in the plants which grow all over our planet. Since ancient times these plants have been used for magick.\n\n Through the medicinal properties of plants are fairly known- many or the most widely prescribed drugs are synthesized versions of substances originally derived from plants- their occult powers are less accessible. Much of their magick still lies in of shadow of secrecy.\n\n Our ancestors knew that plants had mysterious, magickal powers. Although the magick in herbs has been forgotten by many, it never disappeared.\n\n If you are working on a oil, or a herbal bag, and want the herb for its scent, then work out a herb that smells similar and use that.  The lists of the magickal properties for the herbs give a few options, you can use one, two, or all of those herbs if you wish to. \n\n When you pick plants, you should always thank their spirit.  Basically you are saying that you thank them for their service to you.  You should only take as much of the plant as you need, and you should never pick small plants, remember to leave enough of the plant so that it can regenerate itself  Some people like to leave an offering at the base of the tree/plant, something like a crystal or perhaps some organic matter to feed the plant.\n\n The application contains information about more than 200 herbs and their magickal use. No internet connection is required to display the items.\n\n \n Features: Over 200 plants and their magickal properties.\n   Share items with your friends via email, Facebook, Twitter or message.\n   Add items to favorites.\n   Search through the list for a specific item."

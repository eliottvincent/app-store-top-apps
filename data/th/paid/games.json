Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

You can now even design custom interiors.\n\n- Set product menus and pricing wisely to compete with neighboring coffee shops.

You can now even hire a store manager to delegate many of daily store operations.\n\n- Store staff and customers cause many accidents every week. You deal with it one by one or delegate them to store managers.\n\n- Borrow money from banks if you need cash. Watch out the interest rates, though, now that every country has its own GDP growth and bank policy rate.\n\n- As the number of stores grows, store management gets complex. Open offices, hire white-collar workers and create functional departments: Human Resource, Finance, Products, Marketing, Engineering, Executive, and Investment.\n\n- Through the HR division, provides training, recreations, compensations and benefits to employees.\n\n- The Finance now has a cash flow statement, in addition to income statement and balance sheet.

      "label": "\"If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you.\" - , 9/10, Pocket Gamer UK\n\n\"This War of Mine isn’t exactly “fun,” but it’s definitely a game worth playing.\" , 9/10, 148apps\n\n\"I'm really excited to go home and download 11 bit studios' title on my iPad\" , Game Informer\n\nIn This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n\nThis War of Mine: Anniversary Edition\nIt's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? \n\nKey Features:\n• Inspired by real-life events \n• Control your survivors and manage your shelter \n• Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive \n• Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience \n• Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game \n• Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\n\nThis War of Mine experience is now broadened with \"The Little Ones\" expansion. \"The Little Ones\" explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.\n\n• Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine\n• Protect innocent children\n• Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need\n• Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is optimized for latest devices. While playing on older devices such as iPhone 4s or iPad 2 you might experience lower frame rates."

      "label": "In a land far, far away there once was a vast continent called Milton. It was a land where the power of rule came by the sword and the arcane, where Men who devoted themselves to the blade or to magecraft, could become the finest warriors, wisest wizards or the greatest adventurers. In this land, there are several kingdoms divided by borders but united through history. Countless stories of alliances, upheaval, and moments of peace bedeck this tapestry, but that is a tale for another day. \n\nOur story begins in a remote kingdom to the north, Iblis, an obscure and oft-forgotten place. It is a wild and barren land, a place where its people scrape a living from the earth, mining minerals for the lords of the south. On occasion, adventurers would stop by for the night but never linger. Until one day, a fledgling adventurer lost his way and stumbled into a hole. The story might have ended then had he not come back, but return he did, with sacks of gold and glittering treasure. \n\nLike a fierce gale from the north, news of his fame and fortune fanned across the kingdoms overnight, and kings sent their bravest warriors and adventurers to clear the cavern of monsters in search of treasure. Even peasants wanting a part of this newfound wealth partook in these expeditions. In no time at all, a bustling town had sprung up in this forgotten place. People set up camps, and formed their own groups to explore the cave. Clever merchants not missing this opportunity, built taverns and shops near the cave, selling equipment and potions to eager adventurers. At first, everything seemed fine. As explorers delved into the caves, they encountered new creatures and discovered new treasures. Mysteries continued to pour forth from the cave, yet nobody knew where the source of the secrets lay. However, as the explorations continued, the balance of wealth beyond the cave began to waver, and cracks appeared among those adventurers who had previously worked arm-in-arm. The latecomers or weak, limited to wandering the upper levels of the cave, could only watch as the veteran adventurers brought treasure after treasure from the deep. They began harboring dark thoughts as they watched the veteran adventurers grow arrogant from their largesse, ordering people around, hoarding secrets from the rest. The place became a festering pool of suspicions and greed, mired in a jealous rage. \n\nIt started with an adventurer disappearing in the cave. Rumors circulated he had found some legendary treasure and hoarded it for himself. Others said he had been guided to another world by some mysterious magic force in the cave. Still, the unspoken belief was that he had been murdered by a rival party and was buried somewhere beneath the caverns. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but people have continued to disappear ever since. As more people have gone missing, some adventurers have called it quits, others cling to hope, and a few continue to wait and see. Which brings us to you, an ordinary young man, coming into this extraordinary circumstance with purposes unknown to others. May you find what you seek in ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nIn \" The Greedy Cave\", you are a brave adventurer tasked with exploring a mysterious cave and battling all kinds of monsters.\n\nUse your wits to defeat them, learn different skills, gain mighty equipment, challenge evil monster bosses, and decipher the mystery surrounding this cave...\n\nGame Features\n·Randomly generated cave levels provide a different game experience every time!                     \n·Hundreds of monsters to defeat!\n·Hundreds of equipment to collect!\n·Hundreds of quests and achievements to conquer!\n·Enchant/Reform/Level up/Gold collecting, and more abundant systems to explore!\n\nContact us\ncs.thegreedycave@avalongames.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/greedycave/"

      "label": "Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee is the award-winning Rogue-Like Dungeon-Defense game, in which you and your team of heroes must protect the generator of your crashed ship while exploring an ever-expanding dungeon, all while facing waves of monsters and special events as you try to find your way out. The Apogee Edition of Dungeon Of The Endless includes the full game and five DLCs.\n\nWHAT’S BEHIND THE DOOR?\n\nA few hundred condemned criminals were being shipped to the Auriga system on board the prison hulk “Success”. While this was presented as a chance to earn back their place in society by working hard for the common good, they understood that in fact they would be slave labour, sent to colonize an unexplored planet. All they knew about Auriga Prime was what the probes told them: it had water, temperate zones, plant life, and plenty of metals in the crust.\n\nIn fact, the planet Auriga once hosted a major settlement of the galaxy-travelling ancestors known as the Endless. In addition, the planet was still orbited by a functioning (and well cloaked) defensive system, which sprang eagerly to life upon the arrival of the Success. Within a few minutes, the ship was nothing but a few large chunks of metal falling toward the planet.\n\nLuckily, every set of holding cells also functioned as an escape pod, so the ship let itself disintegrate and the surviving prisoners fell bruised but (temporarily) alive and (momentarily) safe to the planet below. Safe, that is, until they realized that they had crashed through some sort of Endless facility, all the way down to a sub-basement so deep and ancient it might as well be called a dungeon…\n\nGather A Team\n• Form a team of heroes, each with their own strengths (and psychoses)\n• Equip them, deploy them, and earn powerful abilities\n• Manage the balance between ex-prison inmates and guards\n\nBuild Your Defenses\n• Use the Dust you gather to power the rooms\n• Use scarce resources to help your team survive\n• Build minor and major modules to hold off waves of monsters\n• Decode Endless ruins to discover life-saving technologies\n\nOpen the Door\n• Each door is a danger; prepare yourself and your team for anything\n• Explore and discover an infinity of levels and layouts\n• Carry your crystal through waves of monsters to the exit of each level\n• Fight your way to the surface to discover the truth about Auriga\n\nThe Apogee Edition includes the following add-ons\n• DEEP FREEZE: New ship, New game mode and New character\n• DEATH GAMBLE: New merchant\n• RESCUE TEAM: Three new characters, New monsters, New major module\n• ORGANIC MATTERS: New ship, New game mode, New character, New minor modules, New monsters\n• BOOKWORM: New ship, New character\n\nCarefully Redesigned for Mobile\n• Revamped interface\n• Cloud Save \n• Pay once to get the full Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee game and 5 DLCs! No ads, no in-app purchases!\n\nIf you experience any issue with Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee, please contact our customer support at hello@playdigious.com and give us as much as possible information on your problem.\n\n© 2021 Amplitude Studios SAS.

      "label": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens."

Players control members of the Night Chasers, a group of heroic warriors, as they embark on an adventure to save their lands from an evil threat.\n\n[Game Features]\n◆ Thrilling match-3 battle experiences\nMatch three Emblems to clear them from the board and make your heroes attack. Clear four or more to generate Magic Emblems, allowing your heroes to unleash powerful skills. Perform combos to launch even more powerful attacks and vanquish your enemies!\n\n◆ Traditional Japanese-style RPG experience\nIn a world of magic and swordplay, players will control members of the Night Chasers as they embark on an adventure together. Enter deep caves, explore ancient ruins, unlock treasure chests, fight against ferocious monsters, upgrade your equipment in town, and gain new information from villagers in the local taverns. A exciting RPG experience is waiting for you in Hero Emblems II!\n\n◆ Substitute Heroes\nEach Hero possesses their own unique skills and backstory. There's Zack, the Human Warrior; Lucien, the Marten Knight; Sid, the Felinian Black Mage; Abner the Bard, and many more!

To fight against these tough opponents, you will need to choose your Heroes'  weapons and armor carefully, and make good use of accessories to resist enemy debuffs and boost your Heroes' abilities!\n\n◆One-time payment, IAP-free, and ad-free\n\n\nA New Chapter in the Night Chasers' History\nA long time ago, there was a mercenary group known as the Night Chasers. Instead of making money, these heroic warriors went around helping those in need. During the war, they helped a great many people who were suffering under tyranny and injustice. However, in the ensuing age of peace, the Night Chasers were no longer needed, and were forced to disband. Years later, four young people - Zack, Lucien, Sid, and Odelia - decided to carry on their legacy, forming the new Night Chasers.\n\nOne day, Zack and his party save an Elven girl named Dolores. Suffering from amnesia, Dolores cannot remember why she has ventured so far from the Elven Kingdom – only that she has been sent on an urgent quest. Concerned for her well-being, the Night Chasers take her into their fold, leading them to discover an ancient and terrible threat to the kingdom...\n\n** Recommend to use iPhone 6/iPad min4/iPad Air2/iPad 5th Gen./iPad Pro or later devices for better experiences.**"

      "label": "In 911 OPERATOR, you take on the role of an emergency dispatcher, who has to rapidly deal with the incoming reports. Your task is not just to pick up the calls, but also to react appropriately to the situation – sometimes giving first aid instructions is enough, at other times a police, fire department or paramedics’ intervention is a necessity. Keep in mind, that the person on the other side of the line might turn out to be a dying daughter’s father, an unpredictable terrorist, or just a prankster. Can you handle all of this?\n\nPLAY ON ANY CITY IN THE WORLD*\n\nCheck out thousands of cities from all around the world. The Free Play mode lets you choose a city to play on - the game will download its map, along with real streets, addresses and the emergency infrastructure. You can also try the Career mode, which contains 6 cities with unique events – survive an earthquake in San Francisco and save Washington, D.C. from bomb attacks.\n\nMANAGE TEAMS\n\nA number of police, fire department and paramedic units are at your disposal. The forces may use a variety of vehicles (from common ambulances to police helicopters), essential equipment (e.g., bulletproof vests, first aid kits and technical tools) and consist of team members with different abilities.\n\nPEOPLE’S LIVES ARE IN YOUR HANDS!\n\nMain features:\n\n- Over 50 recorded dialogues inspired by real calls: serious and dramatic, but sometimes also funny or annoying.\n- Real First Aid instructions.\n- Opportunity to play on any city in the world!\n- 6 selected cities in Career mode, featuring unique calls and events.\n- More than 140 types of reports to encounter.\n- 12 types of emergency vehicles (including helicopters, police cars and motorcycles).\n\n***\n(!) The game requires Internet connection to download free maps. The offline game is available after downloading the maps.\n(!) The game does check the user's location once to propose a city for download. User's location is anonymous and not stored. \n\nAll map data © OpenStreetMap authors\n\n* The term “city” is used within the meaning of OpenStreetMap service and relates to urban areas described as “city” or “town” therein."

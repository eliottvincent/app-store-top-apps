      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.\n \nSlow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:\n \nMOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.\n\nLIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop.

It is recalling the images you took 72 hours later, when 80% of your memory has blurred and faded away, will turn your short-term memory into long-term memory. Our team also has attempted to reproduce the in-the-moment experience of taking photos by eliminating the Instant Review feature found on conventional digital cameras and reducing 95 % of the conventional viewfinder feature, leaving only the bare minimum needed for taking shots.\n\n\"Gudak-dari Camera\", as its name suggests, refers to a time-worn and antique camera. Living in a digital generation where \"Un-do\" function is prevalent, we may have lost\n\nthe thrill of making new and conscious decisions. \"Patients is a virtue\" has faded its original value and people are getting used to selecting one palatable photo out of a myriad of photos. Amid this so-called \"digitalization\", we hope you to recall the thrill of making new choices by seizing the \"Gudak Moment\".\n\nGudak 3.2 Update has added a self-camera feature that allows you to shoot with a front camera as Gudak feels.\nExperience a new look of Gudak and a variety of emotional photos with front cameras as well as rear cameras. The theme will be updated further in the future.\n\n*The Lecoq film is only available in Korea.\n\nAlso, for those who feel that Gudak photos are dark, you can adjust the brightness of photos through the newly added ISO (based on world standard film sensitivity).\n\nA Gudakbook icon has been added to make Gudak photos a real album. Try to experience the feeling of those days through Gudakbook like the excitement I felt when printing the film camera. You can apply for Gudakbook through the print icon on the Printed Envelope Check page.\n\n\n[Explanation of Authority ]\n\nEssential access authority\n- Cameras: Camera access for photography\n- Save: External Storage Read/Write permissions for photoshooting, storing, and bringing in\n\nSelective access\n* You can use the service without agreeing to access rights.\n- Location: Location access to tag location information in pictures"

Included histogram ensures you don't clip highlights or lose shadow details.\n\nRAW TIME-LAPSE WITH INCREDIBLE CONTROL\n\nWith the help of intervalometer, you can get rid of a dedicated cable release.

Recover all shadow and highlight details in post-production.\n\nASTROPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nBy combining (\"stacking\") multiple photos with the same composition, you can drastically reduce camera noise in post-production. Use Shutter to catch multiple exposures of the night sky. This will allow you to produce stunningly clear images of the Milky Way and Northern Lights (aurora borealis).\n\nLIFESTYLE PHOTOGRAPHY FOR INSTAGRAM AND SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nNo one better understands your Instagram business than yourself. Compose perfect shots and improve your Instagram engagements. With Shutter's timer you can take as many photos as you want without hubby's bored face.

      "label": "Designed by a photographer for photographers, focused on RELIABILITY and PRECISION for digital and analog photography.\n\n• Extended sensitivity as low as -2/-4EV (dark scenes)\n\n• Two different convenient interface designs.\n\n• Incident and reflected light metering modes.\n\n• Save exposure data.\n\n• f/Tools connection.\n\n• Independent calibration for the two metering modes.\n\n• Independent selection of aperture, speed, ISO and exposure compensation with 1/3 resolution. From 4 minutes to 1/8000 sec., aperture from 1.0 to 512 and iso from 3 to 6400.\n\n• Automatic priority for aperture or speed. (Automatic Av and Tv modes).\n\n• Automatic ISO or locked ISO options.\n\n• Point metering in camera view.\n\n• Maximum aperture limited by the selected lens.\n\n• Calculate the average of any number of measurements you want.\n\n• Read the exposure data of any photo from the gallery.\n\n• Calculate hyperfocal distance for 5 memorized lenses. Which also blocks maximum aperture.\n\n• Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.\n\n• Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light. (IR button)\n\n• Exposure value EV on an analog scale or right up front.\n\n• Two LED indicators show whether the measurement is unreliable due to lack of light in the scene, or if we have under 30% battery left.\n\n• On 3.5 \" displays preset lens buttons tilting the device or tapping at the bottom.\n\n• Be advised that accurate incident light reading needs a diffuser attached to the front camera. Without the diffuser still can be used but think about it, it will be a reflected reading taken with the front camera.\n\nI'm an independent photographer/designer/developer and am very grateful for your support. Trying to do the best lightmeter app ever, a lot more to come. You can ask for any improvement and I'll be happy to help. This app is constantly reviewed and improved because it is my tool, if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me by email at davidquiles@me.com\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid Quiles"

      "label": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!"

      "label": "DoubleTake by Filmic transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll."

      "label": "This is a simple but powerful photo distortion App. You can use it to simulate body transformations, improve your appearance on social networks, or have fun warping people. All you need to do is drag, grow or shrink the body parts you want to distort. Find out how you would look like with a different nose, chin, buttock, less weight... \n\nOur app, downloaded 10 million times on all platforms worldwide stands out because of 2 particular features:\n\n1) The distortion algorithm we are using produce very smooth image distortions, such as the ones you find in 100x more expensive professional liquify apps. \n\n 2) Our dual display mode, which clones your image into the other half of the screen when you rotate your device, allows you to modify your image without the encumbrance of your finger hiding the area you are working on. This is ideal for small touch devices such as your phone !!\n\n- New Feature: You can now save morphing animations as videos! \n\n************************ \nWHAT CAN THE APP DO? \n************************ \n\nWith this photo distortion app you can transform any face and body part:\n\n• Nose reshaping\n• Lips augmentation \n• Chin and face contouring \n• Weight loss \n• Muscle augmentation \n• anything you can reshape or shrink! \n\nFor fun or simply because you are curious about how you would look with a differently shaped body part, this app will help you.\n\n\n************************ \nHOW TO USE THE APP? \n************************ \n\nUsing the app is very easy, even on small screens: \n\n• Import a head-shot or full body picture from your camera or device image library. Preferably the subject should be photographed on a unified color background and well lit, so the contours are clearly visible. \n\n• Use your finger to drag or shrink the body parts that you want distorted. For example you can crush this bump on your nose, or even make you slimmer. \n\n• Undo latest changes if you are not satisfied with latest modifications. \n\n• By rotating your device, switch from single to dual view, to easily compare the before / after images on the same screen. \n\n• Zoom in, and use the dual view to see your changes on a real time workspace mirror without your finger in the way. This is a great solution to perform precise distortions on small screens!! \n\n• Launch a morphing animation between the original photo and the modified one to see the old you transforming into the new you! \n\nDownload our app now. Then see how those changes you’ve been wanting to see might look."

It'll look that way when you record and send old, messed up-looking retro videos to friends. They'll swear you built a time machine: \"OMG, how'd you shoot that?\"\n\nWith Rarevision VHS, you'll make videos that look and sound like real retro video tapes pulled out of storage after 30 years. You can change the on-screen date to trick your friends, create custom animated titles, glitch up the picture by shaking your device and use the fake zoom to emphasize those truly embarrassing moments!\n\n\"That's freakin' amazing!\" -Everyone\n\nHere's Why You Need It:\n\n• Four words: Best. Throwback. Videos. Ever.\n• Create VHS-style retro videos of your kids that look like the ones from your childhood\n• The only VHS cam app you should ever consider to capture your 80s and 90s-themed parties\n• Shoot your own \"found footage\" movie and become a big Hollywood director like those other guys\n• Make your kids' incredibly boring school plays actually rad\n• Impress the new girl by using our app to convince her you built a time machine\n• Pretend like you lived through the rad 1980s using our app!\n\nWhat Rarevision VHS Can Do:\n\n• Realism: the ORIGINAL and BEST VHS cam app for simulating the glitches of old videotape recordings\n• Import videos and give them the VHS look\n• Make your own signature look using the old-school picture adjustment menu\n• Create your own animated titles for the ultimate in on-screen awesomeness\n• Change the on-screen date so people think you're way younger--or older--than you really are\n• Glitch the picture during recording using your finger or by shaking your device\n• Fake zoom feature dramatically enhances the cheese factor\n• Don't think we forgot to make things sound retro terrible (we didn't)\n• Up to 60p recording for a more accurate VHS video look (depends on device capability)\n• Widescreen recording option (but would you REALLY want to use it?)\n• HD video recording on iPhone 4s and newer devices (1080p requires iPhone 5 or better)\n\nFollow Rarevision:\nhttp://instagram.com/rarevision\nhttp://twitter.com/rarevision\nhttp://facebook.com/rarevisionfans\n\nRarevision is a US-based company, with all software development done in-house.\n\nCopyright © 2015-2021 Rarevision LLC.

This effect draws the viewers' attention to the colored areas, creating striking images.\n\nThe intuitive and responsive multi-touch user interface makes Color Splash amazingly easy and fun to use. Use your finger as a brush to \"paint\" sections of your image black and white, or to bring back the original color.  Zooming in and out using the two-finger pinching gesture allows you to work on details with pixel-accuracy.\n\nFeatures:\n- Short tutorial videos explain the use of all features and will have you editing your images in minutes.\n- Choose photos to edit from your iPhone photo library or from Dropbox or Flickr.\n- Share your edited images on Twitter or Flickr. Email them, or save them to your Dropbox.\n- Save multiple sessions to resume your work later.\n- Undo any number of accidental brush strokes.\n- An alternative view mode highlights the regions that will remain in color with a red tint. This makes it easier to see and adjust the boundaries between color and black & white regions.\n- Choose from 4 different brushes (hard or soft edged, opaque or transparent) and adjust the brush size.\n- Hide the toolbars in full screen mode."

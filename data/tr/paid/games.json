If you're more tech-inclined, you can modify data-driven behaviors in the game to create new resource packs.\n\nMinecraft Realms auto-renewable subscription info:\n\nMinecraft now comes with the option to buy Minecraft Realms. Realms is a monthly subscription service that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you won't be refunded for the remaining active period of the subscription.\n\nHere are links to our privacy policy and terms of use:\n- Privacy policy: https://account.mojang.com/terms#privacy\n- Terms of use: https://account.mojang.com/terms"

If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\r\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\r\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\r\n\r\nWe will update and improve Real Drift constantly.

Don’t get burned and jump between walls to collect coins and medallions. Break stone blocks and activate platforms before you fall into fog and much more...\n\nA RUNNING ADVENTURE\n\nManuganu is a 3D side-scroller running game, in which you control the boy “Manuganu”.\nUnlike other usual running games, Manuganu brings on the “Halt feature” to avoid swinging rocks, hammers, flames and other enemies with the right timing. Another important feature of Manuganu is the ability to switch from “running” mode to “rope climbing” mode when needed. But be careful! This mode has its own challenges.\n\nGAME FEATURES\n\n•Platforming Actions: Double Jumping, Wall Sliding, Hovering, Wall Jumping, Rolling, Breaking Stone Blocks\n•Run through 30 different levels, each with it’s own unique design according to the level theme.\n•Two button controls and specific swipe controls.\n•Run into alternate paths to get 3 Star in all Levels.\n•Three different environments with full 3D graphics.\n•Original Soundtrack by Tolga YURDABAK\n•Turkish-English Language Support"

      "label": "Based on simple rules and minimalist features, Traffix will amaze you in no time! \nThe highway is a place where chaos, stress and rage are always present, mainly in big cities like Paris, Tokyo, Istanbul or Las Vegas. Aware of this, you must control the traffic light to keep the drivers safe and maintain peace. \nStart fighting chaos all over the world! \n\nFeatures:\nSimple rules: Tap the traffic light on the right time to change its color and manage the highway. It works just as a normal traffic light with green, yellow and red colors. \nMinimalist: You will find cars, a bus or a van in almost every city. There are cities featuring a truck, a train and even a plane. Your job? Make sure they don’t crash. \nCalming: Traffix will not force you to think too hard. Each new city will amaze your senses and help you to relax. \nTricky levels: The visual features of Traffix are very simple and minimalist, but some cities can turn very tricky! The slightest distraction can cause a big crash.\n\nEverybody hates traffic. Even when it is minimalist, like on Traffix. \nNow there is a way to control chaos and spread some peace to the streets.\nOn Traffix you are the highway manager. Each city will deliver a different dose of stress and chaos. By tapping the traffic lights on the right time, you can control the flow and avoid raging drivers.\n\nIt’s very important that you do not make drivers wait or they will get mad. \nOn the other side, do not rush or they will crash!\nYou have to wait for the right time to tap the traffic lights and guide the cars to their destination.\n\nThe lights are red by default. Wait for the right time to turn the yellow light on and let one car go. When the road is empty, double tap to activate the green traffic light!\nYou will quickly understand how Traffix works, thanks to the minimalist and evocative elements. \n\nThe rules are simple:\nRed: All the vehicles will stop. The red traffic light will get everybody angry after a while. \nYellow: It will allow one car to pass. After that, becomes automatically red. The yellow traffic light is the safest play. \nGreen: Tap twice to make the light turn green. This will open the traffic light and allow all the cars to advance. Most of the accidents occur within the green traffic light.\n\nChaos Mode:\nThere is a second game mode available. The Chaos Mode is just for pros and it will amaze you by its simplicity. As you understand by its name, it features extra stress and madness. \nYou need to guide the police cars to their destination safely. One crash and you lose.\nDo you think you can complete all the cities? This is your time to prove it. \n\nPlay all over the world!\nTraffix features the busiest cities in the world. Places where stress is rooted and peace is a distant mirage. As you progress, the highway will get more and more chaotic. \nOn that point, one of two things will happen: or you overcome the challenges or you become one of the raging drivers. \n\nSee you on the highway!"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.\n\nYou have only a flashlight to protect yourself.

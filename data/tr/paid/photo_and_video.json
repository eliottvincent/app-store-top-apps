      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

      "label": "Watch any web-video, online movie, livestream or live tv show on your LG Smart TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen with the no#1 web video streamer.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast for LG Smart TV you can browse the web and stream any web video, online movie, livestream or live tv show you want on your LG Smart TV. Mp4, m3u8, hls livestreams and also video-over-https are supported.\n \nThere is no time limit at all! You can watch videos of 2 minutes or 2 hours or even more. Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for link detection and send the video with a single tap to your LG Smart TV. The discovered link will be shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the LG App Store (LG Smart World / LG Content Store) on your TV, search for 'TV Cast' and install the companion app.\n\n* Please enter the ip-address of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your TV Remote or scroll wheel on your Magic Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* Please use the hardware remote of your LG for controlling the TV app and video playback.\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all LG Smart TVs. \n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with LG Electronics or any other trademark mentioned here."

      "label": "Reeflex is the best photography app on the App Store designed for enthusiasts, creatives, and professional photographers! The app provides pro-level DSLR features directly on your iPhone while being extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\n— Professional Tools for Everyone —\n\nReeflex offers two main capture modes - the main one for classic still photography and the IAP long exposure photography mode - providing a rich set of professional tools for full manual control over focus, exposure, and white balance. The live histograms combined with the zebra stripes allow you to precisely monitor your exposure. The focus peaking is a powerful guide for adjusting the focus on your subject. By a simple two-finger tap on the viewfinder, Reeflex also allows you to independently adjust focus and exposure, moving two reticles across the scene.  \n\nReeflex allows shooting in HEIF, JPG, TIFF, or RAW on all iPhone models. You can also shoot in the Apple ProRAW* format and 48MP*** on compatible devices.\n\n— Slow Shutter Mode (IAP) —\n\nReeflex offers the best long-exposure tools on the App Store. Enjoy the flexibility of manual controls and watch the picture forming on the screen. Select either Motion Blur or Light Trails modes to make people disappear, give moving water & cloudy skies a smooth silky appearance, or transform busy roads and starry skies into stunning rivers of light. Long Exposure on iPhone has never been easier than now!\n\n— Honorable Mentions —\n\nOnly a few days after its launch Reeflex was listed as “Must Have APPS - You Never Heard About” by the highly popular iReviews YouTube channel.

      "label": "A quick and easy time-lapse calculator with three modes. The default mode allows you to determine the shutter interval (time between shots) that is required to achieve a desired video clip length for a given recording duration.\n\nThe Time-lapse Calculator can also be set to calculate the necessary event duration (recording time) or target duration (video clip length) based on the other variables.\n\nMost time-lapse utilities only allow you to enter the recording duration and shutter interval. Then they calculate the duration of the video clip that would result. That is rarely useful.\n\nIf you know how long you would like the final clip to be, your video frame rate, and how long you plan to continue capturing exposures to cover the event, then it is the shutter interval variable that you need to calculate. If you know what shutter interval you would like use and how long your video clip needs to be, it is the recording time that you need to calculate.\n\nIn addition to the intervalometer functions, the Time-lapse Calculator estimates the memory card storage capacity that will be required for RAW or high-quality JPG image files, based on the megapixel count of your camera.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Calculate shutter interval, event duration (recording time), or target duration (video clip length) \n• All standard NTSC, PAL, and film frame rates (FPS): 15, 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 48, 50, 59.94, 60, or 120\n• Memory card data estimator\n• Home screen quick actions using 3D Touch: Shutter Interval, Event Duration, or Target Duration mode\n• Copy to Clipboard with one touch (inputs and results)\n• Maximum event duration (recording time): 999 days\n• Clean, intuitive interface is easy to use while offering features for professional photographers and videographers\n• Universal app for iPhone and iPad\n• Responsive layout optimized for all device sizes and models, from iPhone SE through iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, and iPad mini up to iPad Pro"

      "label": "Hey you! Yeah you! Shouldn't you be looking for Camera+ instead? Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots."

It's as easy as \"paint-by-numbers\", but using your own personal images. Unlike other photography apps, ToonPAINT is not just an image filter -- it's a smart-painting application that enables you to express your creativity and obtain compelling results without requiring you to take Art classes.\n\nSimply import a photo, create an \"automagic\" sketch of the photo, color-in at your leisure, and you're done!\n\nIMPORTANT -- You can CHANGE THE COLORS in the palette by DOUBLE-TAPPING on the color splats. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n---------\n\n* IMPORT: Import pictures from your iPhone or iPod touch, or even take a snapshot with the iPhone's built-in camera.\n\n* MAGISKETCH: State-of-the-Art image processing algorithms process your input image to create a customizable sketch, fully automatically. You can create many exciting effects just by adjusting the basic and advanced MagiSketch settings.\n\n* PAINTING: You can color-in the MagiSketch by painting with your finger to create amazing images within minutes.\n\n* TOON COLOR: With our new optional ToonColor feature, you can take the hard part out of creating great looking color sketches and let the app do the heavy lifting.\n\n* SESSIONS: Your current session is automatically saved when you load a new image, so you can continue it at a later time.\n\n* UNDO/REDO: You can correct any painting mishaps by shaking the iPhone, or by accessing undo/redo via the \"bomb\" icon.\n\n* NAVIGATION: While you paint, you can pinch-zoom and pan to give you the most control over your painting.\n\n* HELP/HINTS: New to painting? We've got your back! When you first use ToonPAINT, help screens instruct you about the functionality of the app. For more advanced users, we provide in-app hints and tips.\n\n* LANGUAGES: ToonPAINT now supports 10 different languages\n\n\nWe hope you enjoy using ToonPAINT as much as we enjoyed creating it for you!\n\nYour Insatiable Genius team.\n\n\n(Demo images under creative commons license, by Flickr users BodogGirl, Mickael Casol, and Izzard)"

      "label": "This is a simple but powerful photo distortion App. You can use it to simulate body transformations, improve your appearance on social networks, or have fun warping people. All you need to do is drag, grow or shrink the body parts you want to distort. Find out how you would look like with a different nose, chin, buttock, less weight... \n\nOur app, downloaded 10 million times on all platforms worldwide stands out because of 2 particular features:\n\n1) The distortion algorithm we are using produce very smooth image distortions, such as the ones you find in 100x more expensive professional liquify apps. \n\n 2) Our dual display mode, which clones your image into the other half of the screen when you rotate your device, allows you to modify your image without the encumbrance of your finger hiding the area you are working on. This is ideal for small touch devices such as your phone !!\n\n- New Feature: You can now save morphing animations as videos! \n\n************************ \nWHAT CAN THE APP DO? \n************************ \n\nWith this photo distortion app you can transform any face and body part:\n\n• Nose reshaping\n• Lips augmentation \n• Chin and face contouring \n• Weight loss \n• Muscle augmentation \n• anything you can reshape or shrink! \n\nFor fun or simply because you are curious about how you would look with a differently shaped body part, this app will help you.\n\n\n************************ \nHOW TO USE THE APP? \n************************ \n\nUsing the app is very easy, even on small screens: \n\n• Import a head-shot or full body picture from your camera or device image library. Preferably the subject should be photographed on a unified color background and well lit, so the contours are clearly visible. \n\n• Use your finger to drag or shrink the body parts that you want distorted. For example you can crush this bump on your nose, or even make you slimmer. \n\n• Undo latest changes if you are not satisfied with latest modifications. \n\n• By rotating your device, switch from single to dual view, to easily compare the before / after images on the same screen. \n\n• Zoom in, and use the dual view to see your changes on a real time workspace mirror without your finger in the way. This is a great solution to perform precise distortions on small screens!! \n\n• Launch a morphing animation between the original photo and the modified one to see the old you transforming into the new you! \n\nDownload our app now. Then see how those changes you’ve been wanting to see might look."

It'll look that way when you record and send old, messed up-looking retro videos to friends. They'll swear you built a time machine: \"OMG, how'd you shoot that?\"\n\nWith Rarevision VHS, you'll make videos that look and sound like real retro video tapes pulled out of storage after 30 years. You can change the on-screen date to trick your friends, create custom animated titles, glitch up the picture by shaking your device and use the fake zoom to emphasize those truly embarrassing moments!\n\n\"That's freakin' amazing!\" -Everyone\n\nHere's Why You Need It:\n\n• Four words: Best. Throwback. Videos. Ever.\n• Create VHS-style retro videos of your kids that look like the ones from your childhood\n• The only VHS cam app you should ever consider to capture your 80s and 90s-themed parties\n• Shoot your own \"found footage\" movie and become a big Hollywood director like those other guys\n• Make your kids' incredibly boring school plays actually rad\n• Impress the new girl by using our app to convince her you built a time machine\n• Pretend like you lived through the rad 1980s using our app!\n\nWhat Rarevision VHS Can Do:\n\n• Realism: the ORIGINAL and BEST VHS cam app for simulating the glitches of old videotape recordings\n• Import videos and give them the VHS look\n• Make your own signature look using the old-school picture adjustment menu\n• Create your own animated titles for the ultimate in on-screen awesomeness\n• Change the on-screen date so people think you're way younger--or older--than you really are\n• Glitch the picture during recording using your finger or by shaking your device\n• Fake zoom feature dramatically enhances the cheese factor\n• Don't think we forgot to make things sound retro terrible (we didn't)\n• Up to 60p recording for a more accurate VHS video look (depends on device capability)\n• Widescreen recording option (but would you REALLY want to use it?)\n• HD video recording on iPhone 4s and newer devices (1080p requires iPhone 5 or better)\n\nFollow Rarevision:\nhttp://instagram.com/rarevision\nhttp://twitter.com/rarevision\nhttp://facebook.com/rarevisionfans\n\nRarevision is a US-based company, with all software development done in-house.\n\nCopyright © 2015-2021 Rarevision LLC.

The mobile app automatic displays the app users selected Vaccine Pass QR code after scanning a venue QR code to facilitate the compliance with the “Vaccine Pass” measure. The Vaccine Pass QR code stored in the mobile app will be changed to red color if it is belonged to a COVID-19 infected person, and to amber code if it is belonged to a person under medical surveillance according to Department of Health’s records for the purpose of fighting the pandemic.\n\nThe mobile app also provides a Testing Registration Code function to enable app users to voluntarily store their personal information in advance. This function aims to reduce the time spent on queuing on-site and registration at testing points through a simplified registration process for app users to conduct COVID-19 nucleic acid testing if needed.\n\nThe LeaveHomeSafe mobile app is developed under the supervision by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/privacy \nPersonal Information Collection Statement: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/personal-information-collection-statement"

The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level.

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "Unlock the power of intermittent fasting to reach your goal weight and get healthy. No diet and no yo-yo effect. Improve your metabolic health  and feel full of energy.\n\nWhat is intermittent fasting?\nIntermittent fasting is one of the most popular health and fitness trends. Instead of a diet, it's an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating. It doesn't specify which foods you should eat or avoid, but when you should eat.\nToday, we eat 3–4 (or more) meals per day, and never feel hungry. This requires our organs to work hard all the time, and never take a break from digesting. Our eating habits may result in obesity and health problems, such as diabetes.\nWhen fasting, your body will detoxify, burn fat and regenerate. After a few weeks, you'll feel healthier and more active. \n\nGradual fasting plans, suitable for all! \nCreate your own fasting plan 13-11, 15-9, 16-10, 16-8, 18-6, 20-4, 23-1, 24, 36, 48, Custom\n5+2 Weekly Plan : During the week, eat normally for 5 days, and choose another 2 days for a little control.Women take 500Kcal and men take 600Kcal on fasting days. You can choose to take it all at once, but a better choice is to divide 600Kcal into two meals, 250Kcal for breakfast and 350Kcal for dinner. The food should preferably be some food with high protein content but low glycemic index (GI). It is not recommended to completely eliminate carbohydrates. When eating, chew slowly and savor well. The fasting days need to be separated, such as Monday and Thursday. This light fasting plan is healthy, effective and easy to implement, allowing you to lose weight easily while enjoying the other benefits of fasting. It can be performed long-term, gradually turning it into a healthy lifestyle.\n16-8 is the most popular fasting plan for weight loss. With 16 hours fasting period, your body will gradually get used to fasting. \n \nBody Status Tracker : \nBlood Sugar Rises \nBlood Sugar Falls \nGlycogen Reserve Drops \nKetosis State \n\nMore Features :  \n- Track your weight changes \n- BMI(kg/m²) \n- Water tracker \n- Drink water reminder \n- On 'Record' Page, you can click 'Start' in the 'Daily Steps' card to read step count data from Apple Health\n\nPrivacy Policy : https://wowfitness.github.io/Privacy-Policy/ \nTerms of Use : https://wowfitness.github.io/Terms-of-Use/"

      "label": "Dreaming of a flat belly, lean legs, and toned glutes? Get desired results in 30 days with Gravity Fit: choose workouts for your trouble zones or train your entire body using a ready-made program designed for your needs and parameters.\n\nWe guarantee you will achieve your goals, just like these other users:\n\n”I'd like to thank Gravity Fit for an excellent training program. You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

You can also specify when or how many days in advance you'll be notified.\n・Record your past periods. You can record menstrual periods up to one year before starting the app. If you purchase Simpluna Plus, you can register up to the last 5 years.\n・Predict your periods up to one year ahead. You can take note of your future periods and check them with the forecast calendar feature.\n・Lock your apps with a 4-digit passcode, even if you don't want anyone to see them. Face ID is also available.\n・Data backup. You can back up your data by logging in to your account. This is safe when you take over a device or accidentally delete an app.\n・Also functions offline or under poor internet conditions.\n・Supports dark mode. UI colors differ between light/dark modes.\n・No Ads.\n・The app size is less than 30 MB.\n\nThe below features require a fee. You will need to purchase Simpluna Plus (once only):\n・Color Themes\n・Ovulation Day Prediction and Management\n・PMS Period Display\n・Prediction Summary Display\n・Customizing Input Fields (for example, 'Symptoms', 'Body Temperature', 'Pill Taking', etc.)\n・Customizing Notifications\n・Pill Reminders\n・Widget (Small and Medium size)\n・Historical Data Registration (last 5 years)\n\n\nWe provide Simpluna to be a tool that users can easily use daily. Therefore, we have determined that subscriptions for paid features would not be desirable and only charge customers once.\n\nYou might want to use some more features for free, such as ovulation day management, color themes, etc. The minimal number of free features is because we do not display any ads to improve the user experience. We believe that it is more important to be able to use an app without ads and stress than to have ads constantly displayed and many functions for free.\\n\\nWe have kept the cost of the app to the bare minimum; however, don't hesitate to reach out should you have any concerns. We would love to hear your opinion.\n\n\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://simpluna.app/en/terms-and-conditions"

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal. Or, see the full picture in browse, where you can find all of your health and wellness data.\n\nLearn more about Google Fit and see a list of supported apps at: https://www.google.com/fit"

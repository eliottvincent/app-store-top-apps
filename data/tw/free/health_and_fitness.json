You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress.

In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule.

The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

      "label": "Unlock the power of intermittent fasting to reach your goal weight and get healthy. No diet and no yo-yo effect. Improve your metabolic health  and feel full of energy.\n\nWhat is intermittent fasting?\nIntermittent fasting is one of the most popular health and fitness trends. Instead of a diet, it's an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating. It doesn't specify which foods you should eat or avoid, but when you should eat.\nToday, we eat 3–4 (or more) meals per day, and never feel hungry. This requires our organs to work hard all the time, and never take a break from digesting. Our eating habits may result in obesity and health problems, such as diabetes.\nWhen fasting, your body will detoxify, burn fat and regenerate. After a few weeks, you'll feel healthier and more active. \n\nGradual fasting plans, suitable for all! \nCreate your own fasting plan 13-11, 15-9, 16-10, 16-8, 18-6, 20-4, 23-1, 24, 36, 48, Custom\n5+2 Weekly Plan : During the week, eat normally for 5 days, and choose another 2 days for a little control.Women take 500Kcal and men take 600Kcal on fasting days. You can choose to take it all at once, but a better choice is to divide 600Kcal into two meals, 250Kcal for breakfast and 350Kcal for dinner. The food should preferably be some food with high protein content but low glycemic index (GI). It is not recommended to completely eliminate carbohydrates. When eating, chew slowly and savor well. The fasting days need to be separated, such as Monday and Thursday. This light fasting plan is healthy, effective and easy to implement, allowing you to lose weight easily while enjoying the other benefits of fasting. It can be performed long-term, gradually turning it into a healthy lifestyle.\n16-8 is the most popular fasting plan for weight loss. With 16 hours fasting period, your body will gradually get used to fasting. \n \nBody Status Tracker : \nBlood Sugar Rises \nBlood Sugar Falls \nGlycogen Reserve Drops \nKetosis State \n\nMore Features :  \n- Track your weight changes \n- BMI(kg/m²) \n- Water tracker \n- Drink water reminder \n- On 'Record' Page, you can click 'Start' in the 'Daily Steps' card to read step count data from Apple Health\n\nPrivacy Policy : https://wowfitness.github.io/Privacy-Policy/ \nTerms of Use : https://wowfitness.github.io/Terms-of-Use/"

      "label": "Games that move you.\n\nActive Arcade is a fresh take on how to get active while having fun, just by playing a few simple games. It puts you inside the game and uses your natural body movement as the game controller. Interactive elements will make you feel like you're immersed in an entirely new type of arcade game. It's a whole new world of play.\n\n__\n\nWhile we all want to be healthy, fitness today is expensive, rigorous, time-consuming, and intimidating. In short, “fitness” today is just too hard for many.\n\nActive Arcade is an entirely different approach. It’s a simple, natural way to get active just by playing fun games that use your body movement. Like the casual sports games that we play on the playground as kids, there is no better way to have fun and get your body moving than by playing and competing in physical games. Active Arcade is built for anyone to get moving with only their mobile device—no expensive equipment, no hardcore routines, no wearables.\n\nEven if just for a few minutes a day, moving through Active Arcade is both fun and good for you. Simply use your body to play fun physical games and activities, and get immersed in the gameplay. You won't even know you’re working up a sweat!\n\nDon't exercise. Just play.\n\n__\n\nA NEW TYPE OF GAMEPLAY\n\nYour body is now a video game controller! Active Arcade uses advanced full-body motion tracking powered by AI, combined with gamification and augmented reality (AR) to make the experience fun for everyone. The camera will digitize your movement and power the gameplay in real-time. \n\nSIMPLE SETUP, PLAY ANYWHERE\n\nActive Arcade requires no special setup, wearables, or extra equipment. Just lean your iPhone or iPad against a stationary object like a chair, water bottle, or wall, and ensure the front-facing camera can see your full body.  For an even more immersive living room experience, connect your device to a TV through AirPlay or HDMI connection.\n\nSOMETHING FOR EVERYONE\n\nActive Arcade is simple and accessible so that people of all ages and every ability level can engage. The games are easy to play and don't require advanced athletic skills. There are more casual games like Reaction that focus on hand-eye coordination, and more full-body games like Box Attack that use your athleticism. A wide variety of games are available for every player, with new games added regularly.\n\nFUN WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY\n\nLike real sports activities, Active Arcade games are about playing and moving with friends and family members. But unlike many connected fitness solutions, Active Arcade makes engaging with friends and family a quick and simple activity that can happen anytime, anyplace. 2-Player game modes get you and your friends playing side-by-side.\n\nCAPTURE AND SHARE YOUR BEST MOVES\n\nLike a built-in photo booth, you’ll get instant highlights from your time in Active Arcade that shows off your best moves and are fun to post on social media—complete with all the interactive elements included. Post your highlights on social media and challenge your friends to get active too!\n\nENTIRELY FREE TO PLAY\n\nActive Arcade is free to play and contains no advertising, in-app purchases, or subscription model. It's an entirely free resource for the community and for everyone anywhere to play and engage. Share it with all your friends, family members, or anyone.\n\nGot any questions or feedback?\nPlease shoot us an email at ios-support@activearcade.ai. We'd love to hear from you."

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush.

      "label": "Over 100,000 downloads!\n\nThe feature is simple. When you enter your period date, the next period date is predicted and displayed on the calendar. It doesn't show Ads, columns, and the best time to lose weight. It simply tells you when your period is due.\n\n\nSimpluna is an app for recording and predicting menstrual days. Launch the app to display a calendar where you can check your next predicted menstrual period and past menstrual days at a glance. Simpluna has an extremely simplified design, eliminating all unnecessary features to ensure it does not interfere with your daily life.\n\nFeatures:\n・Simple and easy to use. To input your period days, just tap a date on the calendar and select the start or end button. No need to learn the app. You'll know how to use it instinctively.\n・Leave notes on the calendar's dates. You can keep track of your physical condition or state using the memo feature.\n・Get notifications when your next predicted period is approaching. You can also specify when or how many days in advance you'll be notified.\n・Record your past periods. You can record menstrual periods up to one year before starting the app. If you purchase Simpluna Plus, you can register up to the last 5 years.\n・Predict your periods up to one year ahead. You can take note of your future periods and check them with the forecast calendar feature.\n・Lock your apps with a 4-digit passcode, even if you don't want anyone to see them. Face ID is also available.\n・Data backup. You can back up your data by logging in to your account. This is safe when you take over a device or accidentally delete an app.\n・Also functions offline or under poor internet conditions.\n・Supports dark mode. UI colors differ between light/dark modes.\n・No Ads.\n・The app size is less than 30 MB.\n\nThe below features require a fee. You will need to purchase Simpluna Plus (once only):\n・Color Themes\n・Ovulation Day Prediction and Management\n・PMS Period Display\n・Prediction Summary Display\n・Customizing Input Fields (for example, 'Symptoms', 'Body Temperature', 'Pill Taking', etc.)\n・Customizing Notifications\n・Pill Reminders\n・Widget (Small and Medium size)\n・Historical Data Registration (last 5 years)\n\n\nWe provide Simpluna to be a tool that users can easily use daily. Therefore, we have determined that subscriptions for paid features would not be desirable and only charge customers once.\n\nYou might want to use some more features for free, such as ovulation day management, color themes, etc. The minimal number of free features is because we do not display any ads to improve the user experience. We believe that it is more important to be able to use an app without ads and stress than to have ads constantly displayed and many functions for free.\\n\\nWe have kept the cost of the app to the bare minimum; however, don't hesitate to reach out should you have any concerns. We would love to hear your opinion.\n\n\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://simpluna.app/en/terms-and-conditions"

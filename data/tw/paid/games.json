Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.

Clear four or more to generate Magic Emblems, allowing your heroes to unleash powerful skills. Perform combos to launch even more powerful attacks and vanquish your enemies!\n\n◆ Traditional Japanese-style RPG experience\nIn a world of magic and swordplay, players will control members of the Night Chasers as they embark on an adventure together.

A exciting RPG experience is waiting for you in Hero Emblems II!\n\n◆ Substitute Heroes\nEach Hero possesses their own unique skills and backstory.

Instead of making money, these heroic warriors went around helping those in need. During the war, they helped a great many people who were suffering under tyranny and injustice. However, in the ensuing age of peace, the Night Chasers were no longer needed, and were forced to disband. Years later, four young people - Zack, Lucien, Sid, and Odelia - decided to carry on their legacy, forming the new Night Chasers.\n\nOne day, Zack and his party save an Elven girl named Dolores. Suffering from amnesia, Dolores cannot remember why she has ventured so far from the Elven Kingdom – only that she has been sent on an urgent quest. Concerned for her well-being, the Night Chasers take her into their fold, leading them to discover an ancient and terrible threat to the kingdom...\n\n** Recommend to use iPhone 6/iPad min4/iPad Air2/iPad 5th Gen./iPad Pro or later devices for better experiences.**"

Keep your focus as you guide two orbiting planets down a path without breaking their perfect equilibrium.\n\nIt's pretty hard to describe, but you should play the free online version on a desktop computer first if you are not sure if you would enjoy this game!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- More than 10 worlds, each introducing new shapes and rhythms. What do triangles, octagons or squares sound like? Each world starts with small tutorial stages and ends with a final test.\n\n- Post-game challenges: Speed Trials for each world and a blisteringly fast bonus level for the brave.\n\n- Calibration options: auto-calibration and manual calibration. This is a precise rhythm game, so use your ears more than your eyes when playing.\n\n- Play new levels for free: more levels will be added over the coming months.\n\nWARNING: This is a hard rhythm game. Not in the sense of note-spamming - for the most part all you have to do is keep a consistent beat - but this is a good test of whether you would be a good drummer. Keeping a beat is not very easy, and then weird breakbeats are added on top of that, so don't worry if you find it difficult!"

She sealed the horrors inside the eight Mana Stones, bringing the realm back from the brink.\n\nWeak from rebuilding the world, the Goddess changed into a tree and fell fast asleep for years. However, the forces of evil sought to free the Benevodons to gain control of the world. They started a terrible war to further their plot and destabilize the kingdoms.\nPeace was at an end.\n\nMana itself began to disappear from the world and the Mana Tree to wither...\n\n◆Playable Characters\nPlayers start their adventure by selecting three of the six main characters. The overlapping story of interwoven destinies changes depending on who you choose as your main character and companions!\n\n◆Graphics\nSee the spectacular world of Mana in full 3D render!

Players can switch the BGM to the new version or the SNES version.\n\n◆Voiceover\nFull voiceover in English and Japanese!

A broken household. An evil cult with a mysterious faith. A series of horrifying tragedies. How do these things connect?\n\n「A Fresh Visual Experience with a Unique Art Style」\n\nLife Gallery utilizes a pen-and-ink drawing style and contains more than 50 illustrations, each one immersing the player in the frightening and uncanny world of the story.\n\n「Easy to Control, Tricky to Solve」\n\nEach puzzle in Life Gallery is hidden inside an illustration. The key to solving them lies in manipulating the objects within the illustrations to progress the plot and reveal the truth about the characters--relying not just on the player’s intelligence, but on their imagination and sensitivity to the illustrations and the story.\n\n「Classical Artworks Turned into Nightmares」\n\nClassical paintings such as the Mona Lisa and Dance form the basis for multiple levels within the game, turning classical works of art into surreal and nightmarish scenarios with which the player can interact."

Assign them to infantry, cavalry, and other units to form an army fit for a shogun!\n\nOf course, war is costly in more ways than one. Between battles, your followers will raise funds by producing food, handicrafts, and other goods to sell to passing travellers.\n\nArm your ninjas with the best gear, training, and skills and lead them to victory in the struggle for unification!

Take command on both sides of the Battle for Normandy, mastering fast-moving combat and advanced squad-based tactics on the explosive battlefields of northern France.\n\nIn Operation Overlord, lead the US Army's Able Company during the D-Day landings, and spearhead the charge from the beaches of Normandy. Then, direct US, British and German forces alike in the Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor expansions, with new campaigns as well as diverse new factions to command in the hugely replayable Skirmish mode.\n\nALL PRESENT AND CORRECT\nFrom the classic Company of Heroes campaign to the Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor expansions, this is the complete package without compromise.\n\nFROM D-DAY TO THE FALAISE POCKET\nCommand both Allies and Axis forces in 38 challenging missions based on pivotal moments that shaped the course of World War II.\n\nSTRATEGY WITHOUT LIMITS\nNo timers, hidden costs or in-app purchases — get every moment of tension-packed, tactical action from the word go.\n\nTAILORED FOR TOUCHSCREEN\nTailored to and optimised for iPhone and iPad, the Company of Heroes Collection puts an intuitive interface front and centre, for total touch control in the heat of battle.\n\nENORMOUS REPLAYABILITY\nWith four unique factions to command and master, numerous maps to conquer, and adjustable difficulty levels, Skirmish mode offers enormous replayability.\n\n===\n\nCompany of Heroes requires iOS 14.2 or later.

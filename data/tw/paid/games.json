      "label": "Thank you for visiting the page of \"The Heroic Legend of Eagarlnia\", it's a premium game with no in-app-purchase which you can play offline!\n\nThis is a light-weight \"grand strategy\" game with a unique original story background made by an indie team of 5. Although the gameplay is not exactly innovative, it represents our game producer's passion and understanding of the classic strategic games. With Eagarlnia, we hope to bring you an enjoyable single-player strategy game experience that you don't have to rush to make the better decision, but would be able to play wherever and whenever you are. \n\nThe game first launched an early access PC version last October. After nearly a year of tuning, we finally achieved a 30-day rating of 90%+ positive feedback, and finally we felt comfortable to bring Eagarlnia to you on mobile consoles. \n\nYou will enter a world of Swords & Magic, where there are countries with different characteristics and potential relationships, and you can choose to become the monarch of any country. Through wise management of your own territory, you will grow your economic and military strengths, and eventually conquer other countries and become the overlord of Eagarlnia.\n\nIn addition to the rich and colorful heroic paintings and pixel-style fighting scenes,  you will experience these 3 key features: \n\n1. A story-rich fantasy world with 5 living races  \nEvery existence in the world of Eagarlnia has its own story where rivals could have been sworn brothers. You will gradually discover unknown relationships between the heroes, and along the way you will establish your own exclusive network, eventually conquering them all. \n\n2. A customized gaming experience with more than 350+ heroes\nFrom the very beginning of the game, you will be able to customize the original settings of your country, the management of your wealth, the configuration of the AIs, etc. \nThere are more than 350 heroes in the game, where you can have them join your force through visiting, lobbying and capturing. Some of them are incomparable in intelligence, some are brave, some are insidious and cunning, and some are despicable. Use them wisely to become a qualified ruler. Some special heroes even have their own special artifacts, which need to be unlocked by completing specific missions.\n\n3. A game for creating your own epic story \nYou can choose from 19 forces of different advantages and skills. You can grow your force through internal affairs management, development on wealth and strength, manipulating others through diplomatic tactics, acquiring talents from battlefield, dungeon adventure and many other ways awaiting your discovery. The game is also designed to have more than a hundred kinds of troops, of which reasonable matching and deployment is key to your vicotry. In addition, there are also hidden troops with powerful abilities packed with the mysterious powers for you to unlock.\n\nFinally, we are eager to know your feedback on the game through email to thloe@pixmain.com or chat with us on Discord.\n\nIf you like the game, it's much appreciated that you would leave us a good review and rating, which would really help and support our development team in future updates and optimization! Thank you!"

Combine staff training with enemy battles, collected materials, and skill unlocks, to make your crafted weapons and equipment more and more powerful. \n \nThere are over 200 different pieces of gear and equipment to be crafted, with an equally impressive selection of over 200 skills. With skill combinations, you've got almost limitless options. \nThere's a huge selection of over 70 monsters, as well as a few giant bosses to conquer, in addition to over a hundred missions to complete. \n \nWe've also added some unique mechanics to the game. One example is having to lure bosses out of hiding, using food to entice them. Offer them something sweet, then destroy them.  \nWhen you craft different weapons and equipment, you'll notice that each one has its own attributes and skill bindings. The weapon crafting also has an element of luck, so you never know when you might just luck out and craft the perfect weapon.  \nAlso, what weapon crafting game would be complete without additional enchanting mechanics to further imbue your equipment with even more raw power.  \n \nIn addition to crafting and making money, you can also send your staff members on auto-battle journeys where they'll earn materials for you as they progress deeper and deeper into dungeons. You'll see your materials building up, but pay attention to the health of your staff. If you feel there's a chance they might die, you can run from battle at any time and keep any materials they've already earned from that journey.  \n \nWe hope, whatever you decide to do in the game, that you have a great time doing it.  \n \nSincerely, \nDigdog Studios Ltd."

Help the citizens through cataclysms and natural disasters, becoming a better emergency number operator every day!\r\n\r\n112 Operator allows you to manage emergency services in any city in the world! Dispatch units, take calls and face situations caused by weather, traffic or changing seasons. Help the city survive escalating events like riots, organized crime, terrorist attacks, cataclysms, natural disasters and many more!\r\n\r\nDanger has escalated\r\nHelp on a scale bigger than ever before. The sequel of the award-winning 911 Operator lets you act on many, completely different levels - from taking care of a single neighborhood to coordinating several operators’ work in the world’s biggest metropolises.  Choose from over 100 000 areas, such as districts, municipalities, and tens of thousands of real cities from all over the world.\r\n\r\nTo all units: a storm is coming…\r\nFace the dynamic weather, based on authentic, historical data. Watch the incidents change as day or night comes, traffic increases and seasons pass. Watch out for extreme conditions that may lead to cataclysms and natural disasters. Try to tame big wildfires spreading across the map. Weather isn’t your only problem though - be careful when dealing with terrorist attacks and gang wars.\r\n\r\n112, what’s your emergency?\r\nTake calls from people in various situations, needing emergency services’ help. You never know who’s on the other side of the line - you might hear a frightening murder story, maybe you’ll have to instruct someone on performing CPR, or keep your nerves while encountering an annoying prankster.\r\n\r\nIt’s my job, ma’am...\r\nChoose one of the European cities in completely new Career mode and find out if you’ll manage to climb up to the very top of an operator’s career ladder. Follow the commands of your supervisors and see your actions affecting people you’re in charge of or those who need your help. Sometimes your mistakes will only be followed by a reprimanding e-mail, sometimes they’ll influence your own life. You can also play special scenarios in any city in the world, or make your own rules in the Free Game mode.\r\n\r\nWe need backup!\r\nCommand the best specialists, using technologically advanced equipment and vehicles. Decide what to use - a SWAT team, Search and Rescue helicopter, or maybe riot gear? When your units arrive at the scene, command them in the tactical view that gives you the full image of the situation.\r\n\r\nNEW FEATURES IN 112 OPERATOR:\r\n-25 times bigger, expandable maps of REAL CITIES\r\n-entirely new set of emergency calls and large events\r\n-completely redesigned campaign mode, with objectives system, emails, and a story\r\n-day&night, weather, seasons and traffic now influences the duty and the incidents happening\r\n-new fire mechanic, that can consume entire areas and require dozens of units\r\n-region specification - gameplay will vary depending on a country legislation and district characteristics (slums / business / residential /industrial / forest etc)\r\n-new OnSite situation visualization that shows the action precisely and intuitively\r\n-new team members - doctors, sergeants, dogs, robots, and others!\r\n-additional dispatchers, that you can assign to districts for help!\r\n-redesigned equipment, now packed up in entire gears"

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!\n\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

Players control members of the Night Chasers, a group of heroic warriors, as they embark on an adventure to save their lands from an evil threat.\n\n[Game Features]\n◆ Thrilling match-3 battle experiences\nMatch three Emblems to clear them from the board and make your heroes attack. Clear four or more to generate Magic Emblems, allowing your heroes to unleash powerful skills. Perform combos to launch even more powerful attacks and vanquish your enemies!\n\n◆ Traditional Japanese-style RPG experience\nIn a world of magic and swordplay, players will control members of the Night Chasers as they embark on an adventure together. Enter deep caves, explore ancient ruins, unlock treasure chests, fight against ferocious monsters, upgrade your equipment in town, and gain new information from villagers in the local taverns. A exciting RPG experience is waiting for you in Hero Emblems II!\n\n◆ Substitute Heroes\nEach Hero possesses their own unique skills and backstory. There's Zack, the Human Warrior; Lucien, the Marten Knight; Sid, the Felinian Black Mage; Abner the Bard, and many more! Lead your favorite heroes into battle!\n\n◆ Thrilling Japanese character voices in battles\nPersonalized character voices make combat a thrilling, intense and fun experience!\n\n◆ More equipment\nEnemies attack with a wide range of debuffs such as Poison, Ignition, Petrification or Curses. To fight against these tough opponents, you will need to choose your Heroes'  weapons and armor carefully, and make good use of accessories to resist enemy debuffs and boost your Heroes' abilities!\n\n◆One-time payment, IAP-free, and ad-free\n\n\nA New Chapter in the Night Chasers' History\nA long time ago, there was a mercenary group known as the Night Chasers. Instead of making money, these heroic warriors went around helping those in need. During the war, they helped a great many people who were suffering under tyranny and injustice. However, in the ensuing age of peace, the Night Chasers were no longer needed, and were forced to disband. Years later, four young people - Zack, Lucien, Sid, and Odelia - decided to carry on their legacy, forming the new Night Chasers.\n\nOne day, Zack and his party save an Elven girl named Dolores. Suffering from amnesia, Dolores cannot remember why she has ventured so far from the Elven Kingdom – only that she has been sent on an urgent quest. Concerned for her well-being, the Night Chasers take her into their fold, leading them to discover an ancient and terrible threat to the kingdom...\n\n** Recommend to use iPhone 6/iPad min4/iPad Air2/iPad 5th Gen./iPad Pro or later devices for better experiences.**"

Get 40% off the original game and 33% off the extra story \"Blissful Sleep\"!\n\nWelcome to a grim dystopian future.\n\nA totalitarian State controls every aspect of private and public life. Laws are oppressive. Surveillance is total. Privacy is dead. You are the State-installed manager of an apartment building. Your daily routine involves making the building a sweet spot for tenants, who will come and go.\n \nHowever, that is simply a facade that hides your real mission.\n \nThe State has appointed you to SPY ON YOUR TENANTS! Your primary task is to covertly watch your tenants and eavesdrop on their conversations. You must BUG their apartments while they're away, SEARCH their belongings for whatever can threaten the authority of the State, and PROFILE them for your superiors. You must also REPORT anyone capable of violating the laws or plotting subversive activities against the State to the authorities.\n \nBeholder is all about making choices - choices that matter!\nWhat will you do with the information you collect? Will you report the suspicious activities of a father and orphan his children? Or will you withhold the details about his illegal activities and give him a chance to make things right?

Or should you treat those on which you are spying the way they deserve? \n - You don't know where you'll end up: \"Beholder\" is a game of multiple endings. \n\n\"Blissful Sleep\" additional story is already available!**\n\nThe Ministry of Introductions is honored to introduce Hector, the ex-landlord succeeded by Carl Shteyn.

It may not be the most challenging part,  but it is the most essential section in the game since you need to keep advancing through it to unlock further sections of  the game.\r\n\r\nOnce you have passed a certain dungeon level, you can unlock  “Altar of the Darkness” , “Boss Mode” and “Clock Tower of Challenges”. Those are where the true test of skill and power happens. For our shadow hunters to overcome those challenges, mastering the fighting technique is a must, understanding the characteristics of each demon and preparing a suitable strategy is needed and strengthening the shadow equipment is a huge plus. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, shadow hunters can not only liberate the mortal world from those dark demons but also can test their skills and mastery against other fellows of the shadow. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE CHARACTERS TO PLAY AND ROLL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers will get to play as multiple different characters, each has its own unique skills, gameplay and assets. Each character is going to be a distinct way to play the game, a distinct  approach to the strategy and the combat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntense hack and slash combat.\r\n\r\nEpic Boss Fights.\r\n\r\nMultiple characters to play.\r\n\r\nHundreds of equipment and weapons to loot and upgrade.\r\n\r\n4+ PVE modes and PVP.\r\n\r\nPlay anytime, anywhere even when offline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit Here to Learn More About Shadow Hunter:\r\n\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SHLostWorld\r\n\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/shlostworld"

      "label": "Game Features\n[*]Eight playable characters, each with different active skills!\n[*]Choose from dozens of equipment, jewelry, and gemstones to improve your cards and stats.\n[*]Randomly-generated levels.\n[*]Heaps of game events and unlockables.\n[*]Immersive graphics and music complement a twisted storyline.\n\nOne step at a time.\nYou can only see what lies just in front of you. Will you be able to see it through to the end?\n\n1. Eight Classes\nChoose one of eight character classes, each with their own fighting characteristics. \nTry out their unique talents and find special equipment that is tailored to each class. Some card skills that seem kinda useless on one character may actually be really cool and powerful on another!\n\n2. Tabletop Game Map\nThere are two environments and four levels of maps (with more to be added shortly), all in the style of tabletop role-playing games. Each time you enter a new map, the content, events, and combat objects are randomly generated.\nFighting battles and even some random events will drain your health. Don’t let it drop to zero, or else your journey will come to an end. Always remember to eat and tend to your wounds.\nRestore your lost memory and let the sophisticated and twisted plot unfold by collecting letters that have been left behind.\n\n3. Tons of Rewards\nYou’ll come upon lots of hidden treasures along your journey, all with different powerful abilities. There’s some super-rare powerful legendary equipment, spells that restore your health, food, traps, camouflaging fragrances, hard cash, and so on.\n\n4. Unforgiving Battles\nThe core mechanism of battling is simple to learn, yet hard to master: You’ll need to calculate and combine cards, spells, and talents to surpass your opponent's point total. However, sometimes it’s wise to defend rather than attack, or set traps and develop a long-term strategy to out-smart the enemy. Your foes may have the power, but you have the brains!\n\n5. Improve Your Skills\nDepending on whether you defeat a boss or are defeated, you will be taken to one of two types of menus. When you defeat a boss, congrats! You can buy equipment to replace existing ones! If you die after a battle, you can switch classes or modes, but your previous journey will come to an end...\n\n6. Unlock Achievements\nThere are a lot of achievements to be unlocked, various game modes, difficulties that feature tough late-stage challenges, and high replayability on top of it all. Future updates will further expand the gaming experience.\n\n7. Game Design\nUnlike most independent game studios, we are not aiming to explore deep truths and profound thoughts through this game.\nDon’t get us wrong, it’s incredible when games can tell a story that can change your life. But when it comes to our game design philosophy, the actual “playing” part is what comes first. We believe that the fun aspects of a game are the most important, so providing a smooth and rewarding game experience is our top priority. Everything else, from graphics and sounds to story line, are subject to the core game mechanics.\n\n(P.S.: Actually, we would like to share some deep thoughts: Maybe this game is about how there is no turning back on the endless road that we call life. Each of your decisions will make your journey a unique one. Sure, you’ll need some luck, but the key to success is to go for it!)\n\nDon't forget to visit us on our website and social media!\nWebsite: https://sulaboxgames.com/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SulaBoxGames/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SulaBoxGames \nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/9SfCZdkJVV \n\nWe'll see you on the road!"

Keep your focus as you guide two orbiting planets down a path without breaking their perfect equilibrium.\n\nIt's pretty hard to describe, but you should play the free online version on a desktop computer first if you are not sure if you would enjoy this game!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- More than 10 worlds, each introducing new shapes and rhythms. What do triangles, octagons or squares sound like? Each world starts with small tutorial stages and ends with a final test.\n\n- Post-game challenges: Speed Trials for each world and a blisteringly fast bonus level for the brave.\n\n- Calibration options: auto-calibration and manual calibration. This is a precise rhythm game, so use your ears more than your eyes when playing.\n\n- Play new levels for free: more levels will be added over the coming months.\n\nWARNING: This is a hard rhythm game. Not in the sense of note-spamming - for the most part all you have to do is keep a consistent beat - but this is a good test of whether you would be a good drummer. Keeping a beat is not very easy, and then weird breakbeats are added on top of that, so don't worry if you find it difficult!"

Instead of making money, these heroic warriors went around helping those in need. During the war, they helped a great many people who were suffering under tyranny and injustice. However, in the ensuing age of peace, the Night Chasers were no longer needed, and were forced to disband. Years later, four young people - Zack, Lucien, Sid, and Odelia - decided to carry on their legacy, forming the new Night Chasers.\n\nOne day, Zack and his party save an Elven girl named Dolores. Suffering from amnesia, Dolores cannot remember why she has ventured so far from the Elven Kingdom – only that she has been sent on an urgent quest. Concerned for her well-being, the Night Chasers take her into their fold, leading them to discover an ancient and terrible threat to the kingdom...\n\n** Recommend to use iPhone 6/iPad min4/iPad Air2/iPad 5th Gen./iPad Pro or later devices for better experiences.**"

Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.\n\n*iPhone 5 / iPod Touch 6 / iPad Mini / iPad Air or later recommended."

      "label": "Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler RPG that's simple to get into but hard to master! Every game is a unique challenge, with four different heroes, randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. ShatteredPD is also updated once every two or three months, so there's always something new.\n\n◀ Choose Your Hero ▶\nEach of ShatteredPD's four playable heroes has their own unique mechanics and gameplay style. Smash some heads as the durable Warrior, fry your enemies as the arcane Mage, or use terrain to your advantage as the stealthy Rogue or the markswoman Huntress!\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll earn points to spend on talents, choose a subclass, and gain powerful lategame abilities. You can turn the Warrior into a combo-building Gladiator, the Mage into a soul-sucking Warlock, the Huntress into a tanky Warden, or explore loads of other possibilities!\n\n◀ Explore the Dungeon ▶\nShatteredPD's dungeon is procedurally generated with random layouts, room types, items, traps, and enemies. In each game you'll find equipment and collect or craft consumable items to power you up or help you out in a pinch. There is a huge variety to what you might see from run to run and region to region.\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll find equipment that can be enchanted, upgraded, and augmented as you outfit your hero. Set foes ablaze with an enchanted weapon, wade through enemies with upgraded armor, or gain powerful damage, defensive, or utility benefits from one of the many wands, rings, or magical artifacts.\n\n◀ Succeed or Die Trying ▶\nThe Dungeon is filled with enemies, traps, hazards, and bosses intent on ending your run! Battle hostile wildlife in the sewers and caves, mad thieves and guards in the prison, occult servants in the fallen dwarven city, and maybe something even worse further down...\n\nAll these hazards can make the game quite tough, but don't be discouraged! You probably won't win on your first try, but there are many tricks and strategies to discover and learn on the path to getting your first win!\n\n◀ Almost A Decade in the Making ▶\nShattered Pixel Dungeon is an open source game based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon by Watabou (first released in 2013). It started in 2014 as a project to rebalance Pixel Dungeon but has steadily grown into its own game over the last 8 years!\n\nFeatures Include:\n• 4 Heroes, each with 2 subclasses, 3 endgame abilities, and over 25 talents.\n• Over 250 items including equipment, consumables, and items crafted via alchemy.\n• 5 dungeon regions, 26 floors, over 100 room types, and trillions of possible floor layouts.\n• Over 60 enemy types, 30 traps, and 5 detailed bosses to test your skills.\n• 9 optional challenges and over 100 achievements for completionists.\n• Interface modes for large and small screens, and support for multiple input types.\n• Updates every 2-3 months with new content, fixes, and improvements.\n• Support for many languages thanks to the game's dedicated communities."

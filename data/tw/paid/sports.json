Perhaps bored and passing time, or just stuck at home in silence.\nIt's been far too long since you last hit the court and worked up a good old sweat, am I right?\n\nYou'd go through the old familiar motions, as if on auto-pilot.\nLoading up that shot, arms tensing, and then a flick of the wrists:\nSwish. No basketball to play with, but your motions are on point!\n\nThe good old days flew by faster than you can shout 'travel!'.\nThat's youth for you. It came, now it's went.\nOr so you thought...\nYet now, that imaginary basketball's back in virtual form. He shoots! He scores!\nNothing beats that sound, that classic, weirdly satisfying\nSWISH!\nSo now you're up on your feet again, heart racing.\nYou're alone no longer! That's right! We get you, man!\nWe made AirShot: a game just for you!\n\nThere's the effortless motion recognition. The pinpoint spatial audio simulation.\nAnd it all comes together to recreate that satisfying swish.\n\nOnce a baller, always a baller.\nNo matter how tough life gets, you can always AirShot that stress away!\n\nHere's to each and every MVP out there, on the court or elsewhere!\n——————————————\n[How to Play]\nWear your watch according to the instructions shown to have it recognize your throwing motions, and you'll hear that old familiar swish. Nothin' but net!\n\n1. There's a chance you'll hear a clang as you hit the rim, missing the shot. There's a whole bunch of hidden secrets...\n2. On top of shooting hoops SFX, there's actual shooting SFX, whip noises, and more... We're adding heaps of new sounds with each update, and more gameplay for you to enjoy too."

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

It fully automates your lap timing using GPS, and presents the results to all kinds of media.\n\nYou are not limited to track driving only. For example, you may define your home and working locations as a 'track', collect statistics on different ways chosen, and analyze / optimize the time used every day. \n\nWant to show your drive to your friends? LapTimer Petrolhead and above generates beautiful in car video recordings with all kinds of data overlaid, ready to be presented - e.g. on youtube.

LapTimer offers a Hall of Fame, allows watching you and your friends on track - all in real time.

All edition can be upgraded later, all editions come with native iPhone and iPad support. \n\nThere are quite expensive stand alone solutions for track days available.

      "label": "Listen to your racquet and perfect your game!\n\nRacquetTune ensures that your racquet is ideally suited to your style of play. Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

You can replay games in normal plain flat board with color or black/white mode, 3D perspective view, or browse the game like reading a real book. Even you can view the game with real 3D go ban model through Argument Reality technologies (available for devices running iOS 11+).\n\n+ Web integration goes beyond browsing go4go database to support downloading games from any web site with SGF links. You can use the in-app web browser to view a web site with SGF resources and download them into your device with a tap on the link. Even with running games which are updated in remote server from time to time can be downloaded and updated  with pull down gesture. The in-app browser supports downloading games from links to a single SGF file, or a Zip/RAR archive.\n\n+ Local games downloaded or created manually can be organized in groups. Games starred are kept in favorite page. Games deleted are protected by keeping them in trash folder until you decide to delete them permanently or restore them back. You can search games by user names or tournament names  in local game resources.\n\n+ Full SGF editing features for complex SGF games with variations and comments. You can also transform the games by flipping and rotating a game. Scoring an end game is provided. \n\n+ Support AirPlay with a new board viewing scheme mirroring on big TV screens.\n\n+ Including image recognition for user to generate SGF from images. Work for computer generated board images with 90%+ recognition rate. Support real life board photos from 1.8.0 version. But don't buy if only for this feature as it is not the most advanced image recognizer now (was in its early release).\n\n+ Many features hidden in small details. You can play with the settings and find many handy small shining things.\n\nThe nearly 10-year old app was updated and polished continuously, with inputs from various go fans all over the world. Let's keep the go app standard high together."

      "label": "Designed by sports scientists and coaches. Scientifically validated (publication in review in a high-impact journal). \nThe only app that accurately calculates the complete power-force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino et al.´s method (published in 2015). \n\nMy Sprint is the first app scientifically developed to measure the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes. Innovative design, validated by sports scientists, My Sprint is as reliable as a 4000$ radar plus PC system. Scientifically approved!\n\nSprint running, power output and forward acceleration are a key combination of performance in many sports activities. Determining individual Force–Velocity profile, maximal power and mechanical effectiveness during sprint propulsion is of great interest for coaches, sport practitioners, or physiotherapists. What makes you fast?\n\nTheir opinion about My Sprint:\n\n- Dr. Samozino: “One of our main interests is to make accessible to sport practitioners the scientific evaluations we do in our labs with very specific devices. The simple method on which My Sprint is based was developed in this sense to test the sprint mechanical capabilities in field condition. The results of the validation of the method in comparison to force plate measurements were better than those we expected! And the validity of the data obtained with My Sprint is in the same extent… but with an impressive simplicity!”  \n\n- Pr. Morin: “When we developed our 2015 simple method, we found it was a great achievement to measure sprint acceleration mechanics with a very high concurrent validity compared to the gold standard force plate measurements. My Sprint takes things to another level, since it allows accurate measurements with just an iPhone!”\n\nMy Sprint calculates Power-Force-Velocity profile and measures the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. It was specially designed to take advantage of the extraordinary 120-240fps camera of the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. You just need to perform an all-out 40 m sprint and mark the track with a reference system marks located at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 meters and you only need six visible vertical markers (like thin poles) at these markers to record the time between markers. After that My Sprint does the computations and calculates athlete´s mechanical capabilities.  \n\nFEATURES: \n\n- Accurate measurement of the split times over a sprint acceleration. Scientifically validated!\n- Calculation the Power-Force-Velocity profile using the innovative Samozino et al.´s method. You can therefore know the athlete’s mechanical capabilities that determine the entire sprint acceleration performance. These properties are integrative and encompass all the mechanisms involved in the total external force produced during each lower limb extension and the ability to orient it effectively onto the ground. \n- Record amazing slow motion videos up to 240fps (iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s) and analyse in a frame-by-frame mode as well as import videos from your camera roll. \n- Multi-user. You can create as many users as your need with My Sprint. You can assign each user to a team for a higher ease of use. \n- Performance follow-up. You can record as many sprints as you want for each user created and analyze performance through a competitive season. \n\nNote: My Sprint was scientifically validated using an iPhone 6, and it uses the slow motion video recording on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. On other devices, the measurements are less accurate slow motion video recording feature is not available. \n\nA SPRINT ACCELERATION MECHANICS LAB IN YOUR POCKET!"

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

      "label": "Blackjack Card Counter is a unique application for the iPhone and iPad.  Beware of imitations this is the original.\n\nIt allows any blackjack player, professional or amateur to keep track of their card count.\n\n** True Count **\n\nBlackjack Card Counter calculates the \"True Count\" for you and does it more accurately than manual methods.  As buttons are pressed in the app the total counted cards are recorded.  This is then adjusted to take into account cards that aren't recorded.  A “total cards dealt” number is determined which is then divided by 52 to represent total decks dealt.  This number is then used in the \"True Count\" calculation.\n\nYou can adjust the number of decks in the shoe by going to the info screen.\n\n** Card Counting Methods **\n\nFor each strategy press the button that contains the face value of the cards as they are drawn from the deck.  Depending on the strategy and on the value of the card the button will either add or subtract 1 or 2 from the \"Running Count\".\n\nHi-Lo  - Low cards 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (add 1 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q, K and A (subtract 1 from total).\n\nHi-Op  I - Low cards 3, 4, 5, and 6 (add 1 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 1 from total).\n\nHi-Op  II - Low cards 2, 3, 6 and 7 (add 1 to total) 4 and 5 (add 2 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 2 from total).\n\nOmega II - Low cards 2 and 3 (add 1 to total) 4, 5 and 6 (add 2 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 2 from total).\n\nAfter a shuffle the new deck button should be pressed to set the tally back to 0.\n\n** Basic Strategy **\n\nAs most blackjack players know if you stick to the Basic Strategy for blackjack the house has a small advantage.  But if you can keep count of the number of High and Low ranked cards in the pack you can gain a small advantage.  You do this by betting more when there are more High cards still in the deck.  \n\nYou have an advantage when more high cards are in the deck particularly near the end of the shoe.\n\nThis small advantage, around 1%, over a long period of time can result in huge wins.\n\nDisclaimer: This app is intended for home use entertainment purposes only. At many casinos it is deemed illegal to use an electronic device with the intention of gaining an advantage over the casino. By choosing accept you agree not to use this app for illegal purposes.  The developers of this app can not be held responsible for any misuse of this application.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWebtopia is the trading name for Poulet Maison Pty Ltd"

If you load the video as it is, the playback speed at the beginning and end of the video will not be slow in JumpEye as well, so you will not be able to measure the video accurately.  To fix this issue, go to the Photos app, select the video you want to import and tap the Edit button in the upper right corner of the playback screen. The barcode white lines displayed at the bottom of the video on the edit screen will be narrower at the left and right edges than at the center. By widening the spacing between the rightmost and leftmost white lines, you can slow down the playback speed of all of your videos. After editing, please load the video in JumpEye for measurement.  In addition, if you can not start the camera application in JumpEye, please open the settings application and search \"JumpEye\" in the search window. Tap \"JumpEye\" in the search results, you will go to the privacy settings screen of JumpEye. After that, please give permission for all photos, microphone, camera.\n\n\n□General Information□\nJUMP EYE has been developed to calculate the vertical jump height by using the flight time.\nUse your iPhone's high-speed camera to measure the flight time during a vertical jump. \n\n□Procedure□\n1. Open JUMP EYE and adjust the camera’s focus on an athlete's feet.\n2. Simply record videos of a vertical jump using Slo-Mo (120/240 fps) or import the ones you want from the Photo Library.\n3. Once we playback the video, we have to then manually go through frame by frame to identify and mark the takeoff and landing frames (press “start” and “stop”). \n4. The formula then automatically calculates the duration of the flight and the jump height.\n\n□Main characteristics□\n・Videos are given an automatic file name (hh:mm:ss), which can be edited by holding down on the icon for one second, then we can rename or delete the file.\n・After marking the frames, the jump height is automatically labelled after the file name.\n・You can also import movies from the Photo Library.\n・Manual focus makes feet and floor easily identifiable and precise. \n・You can playback the movie in 3 ways (manual slider, frame by frame, and 10 frame mode).\n・The pinch-to-zoom feature is available. \n・The Rebound Jump Index (RJI) can be calculated by continuous jumping (press “RJindex”).\n\n□Note□\nThe equation to calculate jump height is justified only if the center of mass height is the same at takeoff and landing. Therefore, if you land on the ground in a crouched position, your jump height will be overestimated."

      "label": "****Designed by sport scientists, trusted by elite athletes****\n****Validated in the prestigious Journal of Sports Sciences****\n\nWhat is your maximal strength? Which weight should you use in your next training session to optimize results? My Lift is the first scientifically designed app to measure your 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM) in the most accurate way possible. \n\nKnowing your 1-RM in every single training session is essential to adjust your training intensity and get the best adaptations. However, performing an actual 1-RM test could be dangerous and fatiguing and, if performed every day, it will most likely lead to overtraining or injuries. \n\nTo solve this problem, My Lift uses scientifically validated algorithms that can estimate your 1-RM with high precision by simply recording your exercise. To do this, My Lift uses the high-speed video recording available on most iPhone and iPad devices to measure the velocity at which you are performing the exercise, which is highly correlated with your maximal strength capabilities. This novel approach is used by sport scientists and top-level coaches thanks to advanced instrumental like linear transducers or force platforms, but now you can measure your 1-RM like a pro just with your iPhone or iPad!\n\nMy Lift is very intuitive and easy to use: you just need to record one repetition of the desired exercise with 1 to 4 different submaximal loads and select its start and beginning in the app with its accurate frame-by-frame navigation. After that, My Lift will show you your 1-RM! \n\nLet's say you got a workout which includes 4x5 repetitions at your 80%1-RM. Well, you just need to pick a load and record one repetition with My Lift. It will tell if that load really corresponds to your 80% or not, so you can increase or decrease the weight to train in the right zone!\n\nMy Lift has a lot of great features that will help you measure your 1-RM in a very simple, yet powerful way:\n\n-Estimates your 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM) in a very simple way by measuring your movement velocity, a novel approach used by top sport scientists and elite coaches\n-Measures what %1-RM corresponds to a specific load so you can adjust your training and get the best results\n-Calculate your movement velocity to monitor your performance!\n-Analysis of velocity loss to monitor fatigue.\n-Track the trajectory of your lift and measure instantaneous position and velocity\n-Works with some of the most widely-used upper and lower body exercises by default: bench-press, deadlift, pull-up, military press, back squat & hip thrust. You can even create your own exercises!\n-Multi-team and multi-user: create as many teams and users as you want\n-Progress analysis: save as many tests as you want and see your progress through time to check if you have improved or worsened your performance. You can even see the percent of change from one test to another!\n-Data export: export your whole database to a csv file and play with your data in Excel!\n-iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n-Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n\nMy Lift, train smarter and get the best results!"

In order to individualize a training you first need to make an attempt with the maximum breath holding. To start take 3-4 warm-up attempts (about half the time of your maximum score). Then hold your breath maximally and save the result of your maximum breath holding. On the basis of this maximum breath holding training tables will be automatically calculated (table CO2 and table O2).\n\nThere are 2 basic tables. The table CO2 helps to accustom the brain to the high level of CO2. The table O2 helps to accustom the brain to the lower level of O2.\nThe table CO2 is a series of static breath holdings with the decrease of the rest time at a constant breath holding time.\nThe table O2 is a series of static breath holdings with the increase of breath holding time at a constant rest time.\n\nApnea Tables integrates with the Apple Health app to sync your workouts."

      "label": "The 'YO YO Endurance Test' provides an important instrument for determining the level of physical efficiency of an athlete.\nThe physical capacity is evaluated quickly and easily by placing two cones spaced 20 meters each other.\nThe athlete has to run at full speed from one cone to another and then return again on the first cone. This path must be repeated for six times without any break, and get  the split times every time the athlete passes on the first cone.\n\nThis application will track all the split time and at the end will be calculated two parameters that determine the outcome of the test. More these values are low and better will be the athlete's performance.\n\nBasically the final result is given by a mathematical formula that processes the delta between the averages of the last two split times and the first two split times  and thereby the athlete's ability to maintain its maximum speed for a certain period of time.\n\nThe second value obtained on completion of the test, is the first result considering also the total time of the test.\n\nThe 'YO YO Endurance Test' can be used to determine the level of athletic in all sports (football, running, basketball, volleyball, cycling, tennis etc.)\nAt the end of the test you can get for each athlete the final result (eg. \"Above average\" or \"Poor\") and the Vo2Max estimate\n\nYou can manage more Athletes and save personal data and notes.\nYou can analyze test results.\nAutomatic Sync between devices thanks to iCloud\nInfo section where you can better understand how prepare the test and you can visit linked website and video where get more info about YO-YO Endurance Test\n\nIf you find this application useful, please give a positive review in the AppStore, so we can further improve and develop new options.\n\nFor any further information, please send an email to:\nsupport@bitandweb.com\n\nThanks"

      "label": "Golf GPS is a simple app.  It tells distance to bunkers, water hazards, and pins.  Many similar apps requires subscription (hopefully no additional cost) , or you need to build your own map ahead of time.  While struggling with my terrible iron shot, I got an idea.  When you play golf, you see red, white, blue yardage represents 100, 150 and 200 yards respectively from the pin.  The idea was why don’t I reverse it on my iPhone screen.\n\nIt draws a map around you, and put blue pin where you are.  And draw red, white, blue circle around you.  Since I can add circle easily, I add three more: 50, 250 & 300 yard.  For those who are familiar with meter, I add an option for you.\n\nThose circle should be enough for most player while the app allows you to drop yardage wherever you want.  Drop and drag it to a point you want, and it will tell exact distance from your location.  Those yardages will be stored internally and will be displayed again until you delete it.\n\n\n*** You need internet connection to use this app ***\n\nFeatures\n\n- It works any courses as long as you have internet connection \n- Distance circles around your current location: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 \n- Support both yard and meter \n- 10-yard(meter) circles when you zoom in \n- Drop yardages wherever you want to know exact distance \n- Relocate yardages by drag & drop \n- App saves yardages for later play \n- Compass view (rotate map) to match the direction you are facing; easy to find green \n- Yardages in 3 different sizes \n- Support background mode for quick restart \n- More yardage circles when zoom closely for accuracy \n- Drop a marker (shot from)  where you hit and calculate distance from it\n- Purchase option to remove ads and enable Marker History View, which allows you to review your mark (short from) history after a game"

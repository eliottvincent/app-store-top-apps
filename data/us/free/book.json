Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

Trasladada en español. La Palabra del Dios nuestro permanece para siempre. 1569, también conocida como la Biblia del Oso, es la primera traducción completa de la Biblia al español, publicada el 28 de septiembre de 1569. Su traductor fue Casiodoro de Reina. La Biblia del Oso es usualmente referida como Reina-Valera (RV) por haber hecho Cipriano de Valera la primera revisión de ella en 1602.\nLa Reina-Valera tuvo amplia difusión durante la Reforma Protestante del siglo XVI. Hoy en día, la Reina-Valera (con varias revisiones a través de los años) es una de las biblias en español más usadas por gran parte de las iglesias cristianas derivadas de la Reforma (incluyendo las iglesias evangélicas), así como por otros grupos de fe cristiana, como la Iglesia Adventista del Séptimo Día, La Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los Últimos Días, los Gedeones Internacionales y otros cristianos no denominacionales.\nTraducción de Reina\nCasiodoro de Reina, monje jerónimo español del Monasterio de San Isidoro del Campo, tras partir al exilio para escapar de las persecuciones de la Inquisición, trabajó durante doce años en la traducción de la Biblia. La Biblia del Oso fue publicada en Basilea, Suiza. Es llamada Biblia del Oso por la ilustración en su portada de un oso que intenta alcanzar un panal de miel colgado de un árbol. Se colocó esa ilustración, logotipo del impresor bávaro Mattias Apiarius, en la portada para evitar el uso de íconos religiosos, porque en aquel tiempo estaba prohibida cualquier traducción de la Biblia a lenguas vernáculas.\nLa traducción del Antiguo Testamento, como lo declara expresamente Casiodoro de Reina en su “Amonestación del intérprete de los sacros libros al lector”, se basó en el texto masorético hebreo (edición de Bomberg, 1525). Como consideraba que la Vulgata latina ya había cumplido su papel y contenía errores y cambios, prefirió usar como fuente secundaria la traducción al latín de Sanctes Pagnino (Veteris et Novi Testamenti nova translatio, 1528), porque “al voto de todos los doctos en la lengua hebraica es tenida por la más pura que hasta ahora hay”, corrigiendo la versión masorética cada vez que se aparta de las citas del Antiguo en el Nuevo Testamento. Tuvo siempre a mano para resolver las dudas la Biblia de Ferrara (Abraham Usque y Yom-Tob Athias, 1553), traducción del hebreo al judeoespañol usada por los judíos sefardíes, que Reina consideraba “obra de la mayor estima”, “por dar la natural y primera significación de los vocablos hebreos y las diferencias de los tiempos de los verbos”.\nPara la traducción del Nuevo Testamento, Reina se basó en el Textus Receptus (Erasmo 1516, Stephanus, 1550), en la Políglota Complutense y en los mejores manuscritos griegos que en ese tiempo se conocían. Al parecer, tenía a la vista las versiones del Nuevo Testamento de Juan Pérez de Pineda de 1556, Francisco de Enzinas de 1543 y traducciones de Juan de Valdés."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com\n\nAs the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter. \n\n\nمن صناع Quran.com يأتي تطبيق القرآن للأجهزة المحمولة، تطبيق للمصحف ذو صفحات جميلة خالي تماما من الاعلانات.\n\nلقد أصبح من السهل قراءة القرآن بالشارع، وحفظه، والاستماع إلى قارئك المفضل.\n\nهذا هو مجرد بداية لتطبيق القرآن. سنعمل على تحديث التطبيق بشكل منتظم إن شاء الله، ونحب أن نسمع رأيك ومتطلبتك. يمكنك الوصول إلينا عن طريق البريد الإلكتروني ios@quran.com\n\nعَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة."

      "label": "The “Little Stories” series is a collection of fairy tales in which your kid plays the main role. It's quite simple – just enter your kid's name and gender into the settings window and enjoy reading fairy tales about your son or daughter.\n\nTo make it even cooler, we've added beautiful melodies and wonderful pictures to help you raise your child by giving him or her only positive examples. Moreover, you can also make your own audiobooks! Just spend a few minutes to voice-over the story.\n\nLet love and kindness fill your family’s leisure time to make your life and the world around you happier!\n\nWhy “Little Stories”?\n• 1800+ pictures\n• Gender determines the choice of illustrations\n• 45 exciting fairy tales so far and more to come\n• Enchanting music accompanies each story\n• You can create audiobooks by recording your own voice!\n• 1st place in the “Entertainment” category of Rating Runet in 2018!\n• 1st place in the “App For Kids” category of Golden App in 2016!\n• 3rd place in the “Entertainment” category of Golden App in 2017!\n\nWe’d like to tell you more about the process behind creating stories for kids so that you have a better idea about the hard work we put into “Little Stories”.\n\n1) It all begins with searching for an author. He/she can live in any country of the world, but the important thing is that he/she is able to create an interesting and insightful story. Before writing a bedtime story, the author has to read the conditions first. For example, the story may not contain more than 50 scenes (each of which can consist of 146 symbols max.) otherwise the text won’t fit into the app. Once the story has been completed, the next stage can begin.\n\n2) It is now  time to create the storyboard. A storyboard is a selection of simple sketches for each of the illustrations of the story. It gives us a better idea about the visual images of the children’s story.\n\n3) Once the storyboard has been approved, we move on to searching for an illustrator. It should be noted that not all styles might be appropriate for a certain bedtime story and, therefore, it’s important to achieve a perfect fit between the story and the illustration style.\n\n4) Meanwhile, the composer creates the melody. Both the story itself and the artist’s illustrations serve as inspiration for the creation of music. The composer also has conditions to meet: the melody must be soothing and prepare children for a good night’s sleep since most often stories are read for bedtime.\n\n5) What’s more, we also translate our stories for kids into other languages.\n\n6) But that’s not the end! It’s important to see how the book for kids looks inside the app. Line breaks should be checked to make sure the text looks nice and neat. This is done by two professionals: the programmer and the tester.\n\n7) Only after this final step do we release the story for kids. This entire process might take anywhere from two to nine months. So, it’s a hard, but interesting, journey!\n\nWe continuously add new fairy tales to our collection! \nFairy tales are designed for kids aged 3+.\n\nFollow us on: facebook.com/diveomedia"

      "label": "* First Ever Celebrity Voice Changer® * \n* Join 25 Million People *\n\n\n\n\nCelebrity Voice Changer lets you change your voice to any celebrity voice instantly, just by talking into a mic. This is not a cheap voice effect, like other voice changers on the market.\n\nIf you've tried voice changers in the past, you've probably encountered voice changers that simply change the pitch or speed of your voice, or put a horrible echo effect or \"dry\" your voice using a frequency gate or other very simple effect... That is not us, we are the real deal. Try our celebrity voice changer for yourself.\n\nFor the first time, you can say anything you want in English, and have it spoken back to you by a huge group of celebrity A-listers.\n\n\n\nTo use the app, make sure you have an Internet connection, then Tap and Speak into the microphone. It will automatically detect silence.  It should only take a few seconds at most to generate a video of your changed voice back to you. You can then share the video (which contains your changed voice).\n\n\n\nLegal Notice: ALL ORIGINAL CONTENT and ARTWORK - NO IMPLIED AFFILIATION or ENDORSEMENT - NO CELEBRITY NAMES or LIKENESS - IMPRESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PARODY - VOICES ARE ONLY IMPRESSIONS - NOT A SOUNDBOARD - Celebrity Voice Changer is meant to be used as a parody and to create parody. HatsOfApps is not claiming an affiliation with any celebrity who is being parodied. All content within Celebrity Voice Changer is original, and there are no Celebrity or Brand names; only our poor impressions.\n\nHatsOffApps uses user-generated content to create the technology and to create user-generated voice changers.\n\n\n\nFAQ:\n\n*Can I request a new voice?\n\nYes! Tweet it and ask us in your comments (we read them), we will focus on the most requested voices, so get your friends to request Voice Changer Voices too!\n\n*Sometimes it is perfect, but sometimes I don't understand what it is saying, can you make it better?\n\nYes, and we are working on it. Our Deep Learning Technology automatically learns and does impressions of celebrity voices without any human training. The technology is not perfect yet, but we're getting there. With your support we will continue working until the voices are indistinguishable from human voice. We are also working on real-time voice changer technology in conjunction with our partner. Our technology makes it possible to change the voice, not just disguise the voice or change your voice to an FX chain that makes it sound like a monster or a chipmunk.\n\n*Can you do a particular celebrity voice?\n\nYes. We can do any voice. Our partner's technology is learning to do impressions of humans by listening to tens of thousands of hours of human speech. We use a proprietary neural network that turns a human voice into a voice font, or text to speech voice. In order for us to do impressions, we need audio to create celebrity voice impressions. Soon, we will make available our partner's community on our website and upload any voice impressions for us to use to make voices.\n\nFor licensing inquiries and API key requests, please reach out.\n\nPayment and Subscription Information:\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n• Visit our Privacy Policy at: http://www.celebrityvoicechanger.com/privacy\n• View our Terms of Service at: http://celebrityvoicechanger.com/tos/"

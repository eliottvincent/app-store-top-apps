All qualifying members will be allowed to overdraw their account up to $20 on debit card purchases and cash withdrawals initially, but may be later eligible for a higher limit of up to $200 or more based on member's Chime Account history, direct deposit frequency and amount, spending activity and other risk-based factors. Your limit will be displayed to you within the Chime mobile app. You will receive notice of any changes to your limit. Your limit may change at any time, at Chime's discretion. Although there are no overdraft fees, there may be out-of-network or third party fees associated with ATM transactions. SpotMe won't cover non-debit card transactions, including ACH transfers, Pay Anyone transfers, or Chime Checkbook transactions. See Terms and Conditions. Only SpotMe eligible members may send boosts.\n\n‡Out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.\n\n^Early access to direct deposit funds depends on the timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer. We generally make these funds available on the day the payment file is received, which may be up to 2 days earlier than the scheduled payment date.\n\n¹Chime Checking Account and $200 qualifying direct deposit required to apply for the secured Chime Credit Builder Visa® Credit Card.

On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score.\n\n³Based on Bankrate’s 2022 Checking Account and ATM Fee Survey: https://www.bankrate.com/banking/checking/checking-account-survey/\n\nChime received the highest 2021 Net Promoter Score among competitors in the industry according to Qualtrics®."

We’ll send you 24/7 alerts to coach you on how to do better.\n\n–\n\nEmpower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription.

Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.\n \n** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.\n \n† Early access to paycheck deposit funds depends on the timing of the employer's submission of deposits. We generally post such deposits on the day they are received which may be up to 2 days earlier than the employer's scheduled payment date. Cashback deals on Empower Card purchases, including categories, merchants, and percentages, will vary and must be selected in the app. Cashback will be applied automatically when the final transaction posts, which may be up to a week after the qualifying purchase."

You’ll get a credit line reported to Equifax and Experian every month. Each on-time payment builds payment history, which helps your credit score! Whether you have a low credit score or no credit score, we make it easy and worry-free – no credit check required and it only takes a few minutes to apply.\n\nHow it works:\n1. We set up a credit account for you and report it as a $750 credit line.\n\n2. You make a purchase in the Kikoff store with that credit line, and you just pay back what you spend (our lowest + most popular payment amount is $5/month). We report those payments to the credit bureaus every month while your utilization rate stays low (like 8% low).\n\n3. You have the option to put your credit building on autopilot by turning on AutoPay – that’s right, no heavy lifting required from you after account setup.\n\nKikoff helps you build credit by establishing a payment history and maintaining a low utilization rate, all with no unexpected fees or interest."

Trusted by 4+ million users, Cleo can help you save, budget, build credit, or get a cash advance when you hit those “I need money now moments.”\n\nUnlike most finance apps, Cleo can turn your complicated money life into a simple chat. Want to know what you can spend on takeout?  Any bills due? Just ask.\n\nAnd when you’re in need of some tough love, you can also get roasted for wasting money. \n\nSavings Tracker\n\nIf your savings look like they could use a bit of saving, Cleo’s got you. After setting up your Cleo account, you just pick a save hack— like autosaving or round ups, and let this savings app do her thing.\n\nBudget planner\n\nTried to YNAB your life, but found it complicated? Cleo’s one of the best budget apps because it’s simple. After syncing to you bank account in read-only mode, Cleo‘s AI analyzes your bills and transactions, then suggests a budget you can actually follow.\n\nGET UP TO A $100 CASH ADVANCE (1)\n\nThere’s a lot of shady payday loans and apps you can borrow money from out there. Cleo isn’t one of them. For example, most places that offer a payday advance or loans for bad credit charge insane interest rates and high fees.\n\nBut with Cleo:\n\n- No interest (APR), no credit checks, no late payment fee, no origination fee or processing fees (inc. late payment).\n- No mandatory minimum or maximum repayment time frame.\n- Are there extra costs with your advance cash? No! Example for a $100 advance: Cleo sends it to you and you pay it back on the day you set with no interest. So all you would owe is $100. Not bad.\n\nUse it to help with bills, avoid overdraft fees, or whatever you need it for. \n\nIf you’ve got bad credit you’re totally welcome here too since there’s no credit checks. \n\nThe eligibility process is familiar too. If you’ve ever used an earning app or borrowed money from apps like Dave, you’ll feel right at home.\n\nLearn more [here](http://web.meetcleo.com/borrow). \n\nBuild credit and stay debt-free (2)\n\nCleo Builder is our credit building subscription, designed to help anybody, especially beginners, build their credit history and avoid debt. It also comes with some perks to help you with your financial health:\n\n- Cashback* on everyday spends\n- Up to $120* cash advance\n- Credit score coaching and more\n\nNew money hacks and side hustle ideas each week\n\nYou didn’t think Cleo was also one of those money making apps, did ya? So we’re not an earning money app per se, but each week we publish ideas in-app and on our [blog](https://web.meetcleo.com/blog) about things like side hustles, ways to save money and more.\n\nLegal stuff:\n\n(1) Cleo Plus is our subscription service, which offers eligible users cashback on your money, information on your credit score, and access to cash advances (\"Cash Advance\"). Advance amounts will vary based on eligibility. To learn more about eligibility, repayment, and overall terms, please visit: meetcleo.com/terms\n\n(2) Credit Builder Card is issued by WebBank, Member FDIC pursuant to a license from Visa USA Inc. Access to the Card is subject to approval.\n\n\"Cash/Salary Advance\" and \"Cashback Rewards\" are features of the Cleo Builder Subscription and not the Credit Builder Card. The \"Card Cash Advance\" is a feature unique to the Credit Builder Card and allows you to advance cash at an ATM. The Cash Card Advance is subject to a $2.50 fee per transaction plus any fee that may be charged by the ATM or Bank. This feature is only available to holders of the Credit Builder Card.\n\nLearn more about how we share your data here:  https://web.meetcleo.com/page/privacy-policy\n\nCleo uses bank-level SSL encryption to protect your data and your deposits.

Sure, a simple concept — but we’ve made the process a snap, especially with our Pizza Portal® Pickup, which has really amped up convenience! It lets you order online and pick up from our portal locations in stores. Just punch in your confirmation code and boom, you’ve got your hands on your piping-hot cheesy dream. And if you’re the shy type, this is the way to go, because you can walk in and out without ever saying a word! (Another bonus? Nobody will ever know you ordered extra onions. Except us, of course…but our lips are sealed.)  So don’t waste any time — use our Pizza Portal Pickup and skip that line! So…ya feeling hungry yet? Go ahead, download the app and treat yourself now!"

Using patented software algorithms, the MEATER® app will give you cook time estimates, and guide you towards the juiciest steak, chicken, turkey, fish or other cut of meat that you've ever cooked.\n\nIt’s time to break free from the kitchen or grill and let the MEATER® app monitor your food for you. When your food is ready, you'll receive audio and visual notifications on your smart device. This way, you can stop watching your food cook, giving you more time to focus on the things that matter the most to you.\n\n* Unlike other smart meat thermometers, MEATER® is completely wireless! All of the electronics are contained inside the MEATER® probe, eliminating the need for any external wires.\n\n* Easily connect up to four MEATER® probes at once to cook every steak exactly the way each person likes them.\n\n* The smart Guided Cook™ system lets you know how long to cook your food, when to remove it from heat, and how long to let it rest. Simply select the type of meat, cut, and cook you want in the MEATER® app, then sit back and relax as perfect results are achieved.\n\n* For veteran chefs, fully customizable cooking and alert options are available to give you total control over your cooking experience.\n\n* Access your complete cooking history with ‘Previous Cooks’ so you can repeat your favorites whenever you want.\n\nCook smarter with MEATER®!

Each food has detailed nutrition information, choking & allergen guidance, specific instructions on how to cut and serve the food based on baby's age, videos of real babies eating the food, a unique recipe, and more. \n\nBetter yet, every food's entry has been written and reviewed by a team of doctors, feeding specialists, swallowing specialists, and dietitians. Quickly search for a food (eggs, chicken, strawberries, anything!) and feel confident in exactly how to prepare it for baby.\n\nWith a paid subscription, you can record baby's progress with a digital food log, track baby's favorite foods, make a list of foods you'd like to try later, and track any foods baby has had a reaction to which you can share with doctors and caregivers.  \n\nThis app will be a crucial tool to help you to raise a healthy, happy eater, avoid picky eating, and enjoy family meals!"

      "label": "MEATER® is the world’s first Wireless Smart Meat Thermometer that can help you cook meats perfectly every time.\n\nThe MEATER® app, together with the MEATER® meat thermometer (sold separately at https://meater.com/shop) will change the way you cook your meals, and make it a new and exciting experience. Using patented software algorithms, the MEATER® app will give you cook time estimates, and guide you towards the juiciest steak, chicken, turkey, fish or other cut of meat that you've ever cooked.\n\nIt’s time to break free from the kitchen or grill and let the MEATER® app monitor your food for you. When your food is ready, you'll receive audio and visual notifications on your smart device. This way, you can stop watching your food cook, giving you more time to focus on the things that matter the most to you.\n\n* Unlike other smart meat thermometers, MEATER® is completely wireless! All of the electronics are contained inside the MEATER® probe, eliminating the need for any external wires.\n\n* Easily connect up to four MEATER® probes at once to cook every steak exactly the way each person likes them.\n\n* The smart Guided Cook™ system lets you know how long to cook your food, when to remove it from heat, and how long to let it rest. Simply select the type of meat, cut, and cook you want in the MEATER® app, then sit back and relax as perfect results are achieved.\n\n* For veteran chefs, fully customizable cooking and alert options are available to give you total control over your cooking experience.\n\n* Access your complete cooking history with ‘Previous Cooks’ so you can repeat your favorites whenever you want.\n\nCook smarter with MEATER®! Learn more at https://meater.com.\n\nGet to know us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MEATERmade/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/meatermade/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MEATER/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MEATERmade\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@meatermade\n\nCheck out meals cooked with MEATER® by searching the hashtag #meatermade, and don't forget to use the hashtag when you share your own cooks online!\n\nThis app requires at least one MEATER® probe to operate (sold separately at https://meater.com/shop). The MEATER® app supports all iOS devices with Bluetooth® LE (Bluetooth® Smart) support, running iOS 12.2 or later."

COOK HEALTHY MEALS IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES OR LESS\nWe've reimagined and streamlined the cooking experience. Prepare meals quickly with our step-by-step and hassle-free cooking instructions.\n\nYou'll never again have to jump around looking for an ingredient, instruction, or piece of cookware that you may have overlooked. \n\n3. NO MORE STRESSFUL \"WHAT SHOULD I EAT?\" DECISIONS TO MAKE\nEach week you'll have a personalized meal plan with simple & healthy recipes that are catered to your exact needs and preferences.\n\nEliminate decision fatigue after a long day's work - simply pick a recipe from your meal plan and cook it in less time than it takes to pick up an unhealthy (and expensive) takeout meal.\n\n4. HEALTHY MEAL PLANS THAT ARE UNIQUELY YOUR OWN\nWith the most personalization options of any minimal-waste meal planner out there, you can cook exactly how you want to eat.\n\nFrom classic, flexitarian, pescetarian, low carb, paleo, keto, vegetarian & vegan diet types to gluten free, dairy free, and a dozen more restrictions, and hundreds of individual dislikable ingredients, your meal plans will be truly personalized to your specific needs.\n\n5. SAVE MONEY WITH MINIMAL FOOD WASTE\nIt's annoying when you purchase ingredients from the grocery store, cook a meal or two, and have a bunch of ingredients going bad by the end of the week, isn't it?\n\nWith Mealime, your days of wasting food are over! All meal plans are intelligently created in order to eliminate food waste as much as possible, saving you hundreds of dollars per year.\n\n6. KEEP TRACK OF YOUR NUTRITION GOALS\nEvery Mealime recipe lists comprehensive nutrition information so you can easily see what you're eating.

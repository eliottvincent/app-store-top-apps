Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only."

      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

      "label": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app.\n\nAlong with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.\n\nThrough our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.\n\n**The I Am Sober app features:**\n\n• Sober day tracker\nTo visualize how long you’ve been sober.\n\n• Remember why you quit\nAdd reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.\n\n• Daily pledge tracker\nTake a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "Get projects done right the first time with easy-to-follow BILT instructions.\n\n\nFEATURES\n- Follow interactive 3D animation on each step\n- Zoom in and out\n- Rotate 3D images for a better angle\n- Tap on any part for details\n- Choose optional voice narration & text guides\n- Skip ahead, go back, or replay a step instantly\n- Be confident with official, up-to-date, brand-approved guides\n- Download instructions ahead to use without WiFi\n\n\n\nBENEFITS\n- Easier to understand than paper or video\n- Reduces paper waste\n- Confidence you did it right the first time\n\nWhether it’s for assembly, installation, maintenance, or repair, BILT instructions are a revolutionary new way to set up products efficiently.\n\n\n\nWHY IS BILT FREE?\nIt’s true — BILT is free to everyone! And unlike instructions online, BILT doesn’t allow ads or annoying pop-ups. The platform is paid for by hundreds of leading brands that believe you deserve a better experience with their products. These participating brands provide 3D instructions as a service because BILT users are happier with their purchases and have fewer returns. It’s a win-win!\n\n\n\nNO SIGN IN!\nYou do not need to provide any personal information or create an account to use BILT. We’re serious about making it easy.\n\nBut there are benefits to creating a BILT account: \n- Save your receipt\n- Register a product\n- Access warranty information\n- Keep downloaded instructions in “My Stuff” to access later\n- Leave a rating & review to help your favorite brands improve their products over time\n\n\n\nAWARDS\n- Most Innovative Construction Tool, National Association of Home Builders\n- Gold Winner, User Experience Awards\n- Winner, Pro Tool Innovation Awards\n\n\n\nBILT TOOLBOX\nThe BILT Toolbox is a collection of instructions to help you with home, auto, and safety projects, as well as guides for basic power tools. Follow easy BILT instructions to fix a toilet, lay bathroom tile, paint a room, jump a car battery, change a tire, use a circular saw, adjust a bicycle, repair drywall, and so much more to help with anything adulthood sends your way.\n\nWe use the BILT Toolbox too, so if we have a question about something, we design an instruction for it. We welcome your suggestions, too. From personal experience we recommend downloading “How to Jump a Car Battery” before you need it because internet connections at soccer fields can be spotty. :)\n\n\n\nDATA PRIVACY\nWe do not collect personal data other than what you choose to provide if you create an account, register a product, or leave a review. \n\nWe do collect aggregate data such as the number of downloads for each product and the average time it takes to complete an instruction step, but it cannot be tied to an individual user.\n\n\n\nFEEDBACK FROM OUR USERS\n- “I really like putting things together, but the BILT app made it a breeze! A fun little activity and a great outcome. I’m a visual learner so I really appreciate a 3D option with parts clearly labeled!! I could build a million things with the help of this app particularly. Highly recommend!!!”\n\n- \"I'm telling you, I could easily engineer a space craft if they had the directions on BILT.\"\n\n- \"I usually shy away from putting stuff together but this helped me a lot. I’m proud of myself.”\n\n- “Made it very easy, I didn’t cuss or throw anything.”\n\n- “My husband & I are NOT handy people. However, with the BILT app we were able to correctly put together a grill in a couple hours with NO arguments! LOL! This app may have saved our marriage.

      "label": "Your ultimate cleaning partner is here. Meet the redesigned SharkClean® app. Cleaning convenience, confidence, and control are at your fingertips. Finally, cleaning has never been easier.\n\n\nNow, your unique home is at the center of the SharkClean® app. With precision home mapping, you can customize where, when, and how your robot cleans, right from the home screen.*\n\n\nYou can set cleaning schedules, send your robot to clean certain rooms or spots on-demand in UltraClean Mode™, mark areas for your robot to avoid altogether, and more.\n\n\nPlus, easily access troubleshooting tips and FAQs, control notifications, and view custom cleaning reports (varies by series).\n\n\n1. PRECISION MAPPING (1000 & 2000 series)\n     • Once your robot generates a map of your home, you can create rooms and high-traffic zones using our improved editing functionality.\n     • Take advantage of our brand-new interactive map interface where you can customize cleaning by immediately sending your robot to clean specific rooms and zones.\n     • Tackle messes or pesky debris with the new Spot Clean feature (2000 series).\n\n\n2.

Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

      "label": "WHAT IS ONLINE CHECK-IN? \nOnline Check-In saves you time by seeing estimated wait times for hair salons near you. From there, just pick your favorite salon, and get on the waitlist from wherever you are. \n\nFEATURES:\n-Check estimated wait times based on current conditions in the salon and updates in real time.\n-Online Check-In: You save time by checking in to the salon ahead of time - saving your place in line.\n-ReadyNext®: Get text alerts to notify you when your estimated wait time reaches 15 minutes as your cue to head to the salon.\n-Save your favorite hair salon so it’s even quicker next time you check in! \n\nHOW TO USE:\n-Tap the Search icon\n-Pick a hair salon near you\n-Tap the Check In button\n-Enter your name and phone number\n-Tap Check In again to be added to the wait list – no login, email, or profile required. \n-Let the salon know when you arrive.\n\nAfter you check in, you can watch your estimated wait time countdown and arrive at the salon when it's nearly your turn to get your service.\n\nESTIMATED WAIT TIME\nEstimated wait times assume you are getting the next available stylist. You can request a stylist upon arrival at the salon but your wait may be longer. For safety and privacy reasons, we do not publish stylist schedules.\n\nWHEN IS ONLINE CHECK-IN AVAILABLE?\nCustomers can check in online during the hours the salon is open. Online Check-In will not be available during the first five minutes a salon is scheduled to be open. This gives customers who are physically in the salon when it opens a chance to be checked in and have their names added to the waitlist. We accept online check-in up until 30 minutes before closing time. You can still get a haircut at closing time, you just can't check in on the app.\n\nCAN I USE ONLINE CHECK-IN FOR MORE THAN A HAIRCUT?\nYes, you can use Online Check-In for all services except perms and formal updos. Please note that not all salons offer perms. And, most salons require an appointment for these services, so please call the salon to inquire.\n\nWHAT DO I DO IF I DON’T HAVE A MOBILE DEVICE?\nYou can check in from any device that has internet (a smartphone, iPad, computer, etc.). Go to greatclips.com, click on Find a Salon or Check In. Enter your postal code or address and you'll be using Online Check-In in no time! If you don't have an Internet connection, you can always walk right in to any salon and add your name to the list.\n\nWHEN SHOULD I ARRIVE AT THE SALON?\nAfter you've checked in online, you will see what place you are in on the waitlist. You'll want to arrive to the salon before you are next in line. If you'd like to receive a text message when your estimated wait time reaches 15 minutes, you can sign up for ReadyNext® text alerts. Once you arrive at the salon, let the stylists know you're there, and they will confirm your information and finish your check in.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF I ARRIVE LATE?\nWe understand: Things happen! Don't worry if you lose your keys, spill something, or get stuck in traffic. We'll keep your name on the list for a short period of time.\n\nHOW DO I CANCEL MY CHECK IN?\nOnce you are checked in, the salon will appear on the home screen. Cancel at any time by tapping Cancel check-in."

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

The App is compatible with both 10-day and 14-day Sensors.\r\n\r\nYou can use the App to:\r\n\r\n* Check your glucose with a painless scan, instead of a routine fingerstick [1]\r\n* View your current glucose reading, trend arrow, and glucose history\r\n* Add notes to track your food, insulin use, and exercise\r\n* See glucose reports, including your Ambulatory Glucose Profile\r\n* Connect to healthcare professionals with LibreView [2]\r\n\r\nSMARTPHONE COMPATIBILITY\r\nCompatibility may vary between phones and operating systems. Learn more about compatible phones at http://FreeStyleLibre.us\r\n\r\nUSING YOUR APP AND FREESTYLE LIBRE READER WITH THE SAME SENSOR\r\nIf you would like to use both the FreeStyle Libre Reader and the App with the same Sensor, you need to start the Sensor with the Reader first and then scan with your iPhone. Note that FreeStyle LibreLink and Readers do not share data with each other. For complete information on a device, scan your Sensor every 8 hours with that device; otherwise, your reports will not include all your data.\r\n\r\nAPP INFORMATION\r\nFreeStyle LibreLink is intended for measuring glucose levels in people with diabetes when used with a FreeStyle Libre Sensor. For more information on how to use FreeStyle LibreLink, refer to the User’s Manual, which can be accessed through the App.\r\n\r\nLearn more about FreeStyle LibreLink at http://FreeStyleLibre.us\r\n\r\n[1] If you are using the FreeStyle LibreLink app, you must also have access to a blood glucose monitoring system as the App does not provide one. Fingersticks are required for treatment decisions when you see the Check Blood Glucose symbol, when symptoms do not match system readings, when you suspect readings may be inaccurate, or when you experience symptoms that may be due to high or low blood glucose.\r\n\r\n[2] Use of the FreeStyle LibreLink app requires registration with the LibreView system, which is provided by Abbott and Newyu, Inc.\r\n\r\nThe circular shape of the sensor housing, FreeStyle, Libre, and related brand marks are marks of Abbott.

      "label": "Still seeing well out of your current glasses or contacts prescription, but now it's expired? Virtual Vision Test by Warby Parker lets you renew it from home in 10 minutes using just your phone! \n\n*Pricing*\n- You'll only be charged if we can renew your prescription\n- You’ll hear back from our doctors within 48 hours. If the doctor renews your prescription, you’ll be charged $15 for a renewed glasses or contacts prescription—or $25 for both.\n- If they cannot renew your prescription and instead recommend you get an in-person, comprehensive eye exam, you will not be charged.\n\n*Eligibility*\nTo use Virtual Vision Test, you must meet eligibility requirements set by state regulations and our doctors. Virtual Vision Test is great for anyone who:\n- Is between 18 and 65 years old\n- Does not live in one of the following states: AK, DC, GA, ID, KY, NJ, NM, SC, SD, WA, WV\n- Has a single-vision distance Rx (not readers or progressives)\n- Has no eye health concerns or symptoms\n- Sees well with their current glasses or contacts\n\nHow it works!\n\nIt’s as simple as reading the eye chart at the doctor’s office—but on your phone. You just need your eyeballs, your glasses or contacts, and your phone.\n1. We’ll guide you through a simple (but thorough) eligibility quiz to make sure the app is a good fit for you.\n2. If you’re eligible, the app takes you through an equally simple vision test. You'll need to complete it in a quiet, well-lit spot where you have about 10 feet of space.\n3. In about 48 hours, an eye doctor will assess your results. If they determine that you're still seeing well out of your current prescription, then the doctor may renew it and you'll pay $15 for one renewed prescription or $25 for both. \n\nFYI: Virtual Vision Test by Warby Parker is not a comprehensive eye exam and it isn’t meant to replace visits to your eye doctor. It’s important to get your eye health examined periodically, even if you aren’t experiencing any vision problems, so please follow the advice of your doctor. Good to keep those peepers in check."

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

As seen in Apple’s “Parenthood” commercial, Parents Magazine, USA Today, Good Morning America, The New York Times, CBS This Morning, and more!\n\nKNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT\nOur care recommendations give you peace of mind with age-specific fever and symptom guidance - so you can know when it’s important to take extra precaution or see a doctor.\n\nREMEMBERS FOR YOU\nEasily track temperatures, symptoms and medication for everyone in your family! Remember details such as when symptoms began, how high the fever got, or when to give another dose of medication and share it with another caregiver or your doctor. Temperature data integrates seamlessly with HealthKit and the Health app.\n\nWHAT PARENTS ARE SAYING\n“The app tracks and organizes our family’s temps and symptoms and keeps the history. This is a wonderful app for a busy and sleep deprived mom!” \n“Hands down my favorite feature is that the app gives you suggestions on how to keep your little one comfortable and gives practical advice for a speedy recovery!”\n“The Kinsa app keeps all my data in one place and makes doctors appointments a breeze…”\n“We are a family of 6! Kinsa helps us keep track of everyone’s medical situation!”\n“This has to be one of the best products on the market for families, especially families with little ones!” \n\nThe free Kinsa app works best with Kinsa's award-winning, pediatrician-recommended QuickCare, QuickScan, and Smart Ear thermometers, available for purchase online and in retail stores across the U.S. If you have an older Smart Stick thermometer that plugs into the headphone jack of your phone, please use the Kinsa Smart Stick app instead. \n\nWe hope your family doesn't get sick, but if they do, we'll be there to help your family feel better faster!\n\nAll information, images, and other content shared through Kinsa’s mobile or web applications is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment from an appropriately qualified and licensed physician or other healthcare provider.

      "label": "Still seeing well out of your current glasses or contacts prescription, but now it's expired? Virtual Vision Test by Warby Parker lets you renew it from home in 10 minutes using just your phone! \n\n*Pricing*\n- You'll only be charged if we can renew your prescription\n- You’ll hear back from our doctors within 48 hours. If the doctor renews your prescription, you’ll be charged $15 for a renewed glasses or contacts prescription—or $25 for both.\n- If they cannot renew your prescription and instead recommend you get an in-person, comprehensive eye exam, you will not be charged.\n\n*Eligibility*\nTo use Virtual Vision Test, you must meet eligibility requirements set by state regulations and our doctors. Virtual Vision Test is great for anyone who:\n- Is between 18 and 65 years old\n- Does not live in one of the following states: AK, DC, GA, ID, KY, NJ, NM, SC, SD, WA, WV\n- Has a single-vision distance Rx (not readers or progressives)\n- Has no eye health concerns or symptoms\n- Sees well with their current glasses or contacts\n\nHow it works!\n\nIt’s as simple as reading the eye chart at the doctor’s office—but on your phone. You just need your eyeballs, your glasses or contacts, and your phone.\n1. We’ll guide you through a simple (but thorough) eligibility quiz to make sure the app is a good fit for you.\n2. If you’re eligible, the app takes you through an equally simple vision test. You'll need to complete it in a quiet, well-lit spot where you have about 10 feet of space.\n3. In about 48 hours, an eye doctor will assess your results. If they determine that you're still seeing well out of your current prescription, then the doctor may renew it and you'll pay $15 for one renewed prescription or $25 for both. \n\nFYI: Virtual Vision Test by Warby Parker is not a comprehensive eye exam and it isn’t meant to replace visits to your eye doctor. It’s important to get your eye health examined periodically, even if you aren’t experiencing any vision problems, so please follow the advice of your doctor. Good to keep those peepers in check."

In other words, the ultimate job flexibility. \n\nOur nursing jobs app provides easy and direct access to thousands of open nursing shifts at healthcare facilities near you. As a ShiftMed healthcare professional, you’re essentially your own boss.  \n\nAs a ShiftMed caregiver, you get to: \n- Maintain a work schedule that meets your personal and professional needs. \n- Care for patients in a variety of healthcare settings, including skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. \n- Work per diem any time of the day or night—weekends and holidays are optional. \n- Choose to work 8 hours one week and 40 the next—no shift minimums. \n- Claim Guaranteed Shifts® to get paid for the ENTIRE shift if the facility cancels. \n- Access our FREE Next Day Pay® service to get paid the next business day.  \n- Enjoy competitive pay, bonuses, holiday rates, and promotional perks. \n\nHow ShiftMed Works \nTo use our nursing jobs app, you must hold an active CNA, GNA, STNA, LPN, or RN license and complete our onboarding process. Once you’re approved to claim shifts, the app gives you direct access to thousands of open shifts at healthcare facilities in your area, including long-term care facilities, assisted living communities, skilled nursing facilities, hospitals, and more! \n\nClaiming Shifts \nIt’s easy to create the ideal work schedule using our nurse staffing app. You can filter your shift feed based on your preferred start time, distance from your home, hourly rate, and even your favorite facility.  \nWhen you claim a shift, the app notifies the healthcare facility directly. So, there’s no waiting for us to approve anything. And should something unexpected come up, you can cancel a shift directly in the app.    \n\nEmployment Status \nWhen working in the medical field through ShiftMed, you’re a W-2 employee—not a 1099 contractor. So, there’s no need to worry about owing large sums at tax time. Just continue to do the work you love by picking up per diem shifts on our nursing jobs app.  \n\nLearn more about working with us as a CNA, GNA, STNA, LPN, or RN at ShiftMed.com \n\nConnect with us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and LinkedIn \n\nWant to speak with someone on our team?

The App is compatible with both 10-day and 14-day Sensors.\r\n\r\nYou can use the App to:\r\n\r\n* Check your glucose with a painless scan, instead of a routine fingerstick [1]\r\n* View your current glucose reading, trend arrow, and glucose history\r\n* Add notes to track your food, insulin use, and exercise\r\n* See glucose reports, including your Ambulatory Glucose Profile\r\n* Connect to healthcare professionals with LibreView [2]\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\nSMARTPHONE COMPATIBILITY\r\nCompatibility may vary between phones and operating systems. Learn more about compatible phones at http://FreeStyleLibre.us\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\nUSING YOUR APP AND READER WITH THE SAME SENSOR\r\nIf you would like to use both the FreeStyle Libre Reader and the App with the same Sensor, you need to start the Sensor with the Reader first and then scan with your phone. Note that FreeStyle LibreLink and Readers do not share data with each other. For complete information on a device, scan your Sensor every 8 hours with that device; otherwise, your reports will not include all your data. You can upload and view data from all of your devices on LibreView.com. \r\n\r\nAPP INFORMATION\r\nFreeStyle LibreLink is intended for measuring glucose levels in people with diabetes when used with a Sensor. For more information on how to use FreeStyle LibreLink, refer to the User’s Manual, which can be accessed through the app. If you require a printed User’s Manual, contact Abbott Diabetes Care Customer Support.\r\n\r\nLearn more about FreeStyle LibreLink at http://FreeStyleLibre.us\r\n\r\n[1] If you are using the FreeStyle LibreLink app, you must also have access to a blood glucose monitoring system as the App does not provide one. Fingersticks are required for treatment decisions when you see the Check Blood Glucose symbol, when symptoms do not match system readings, when you suspect readings may be inaccurate, or when you experience symptoms that may be due to high or low blood glucose. \r\n\r\n[2] Use of FreeStyle LibreLink requires registration with LibreView.\r\n \r\nThe circular shape of the sensor housing, FreeStyle, Libre, and related brand marks are marks of Abbott.

      "label": "If you’re receiving services for behavioral health, counseling, speech pathology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, or any other wellness service by a practitioner who uses SimplePractice, this app is for you! The SimplePractice Client Portal iOS app empowers you to manage care for you or your loved ones from one secure place. Stay connected with your practitioner between appointments from the convenience of your phone. Your personal information is kept private, yet easily accessible for your convenience.\n\nSimplify how you access care with features like:\nPasswordless login – Securely log into your Client Portal without the hassle of a username or password by setting up a passcode, touch ID, or Face ID for instant access. \nPersonalized notifications – Get push notifications sent right to your phone regarding any new messages, invoices, or documents that have been sent to you by your practitioner.\nSecure messaging – Message your practitioner directly from your phone knowing that all communication is secure and private.\nUpcoming appointments and requests – View all your upcoming appointments, and request a new appointment with your practitioner directly from the app. \nDigital payments – Add new payment methods to pay your bills including HSA and FSA cards. You can even pay directly from the app. \nDigital paperwork – Complete documents and questionnaires related to care on your own time. \nTelehealth – Join virtual appointments with your practitioner directly from the app, so you never have to find a link buried in your inbox again. \nAppointment directions – Get automatically transferred to your preferred mobile navigation app for easy directions to your practitioner’s office.\nProfile switching – Quickly toggle between any Client Portal you’re managing—whether you’re seeing different providers who use SimplePractice for practice management or are managing care for multiple individuals.\n\nTo access the SimplePractice Client Portal iOS app, you must be invited to use the SimplePractice Client Portal by your practitioner. When you first log into the app, the email you provided to your practitioner will be used to authenticate your Client Portal access. After you’ve signed up, turn on Face ID, Touch ID, or a four-digit passcode for hassle-free login.

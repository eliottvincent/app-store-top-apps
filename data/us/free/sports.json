      "label": "CollX (pronounced “collects”) answers the question every collector has: “What’s it worth?” The app lets you scan any baseball, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, or wrestling card and instantly identify it and get the average market value. Once you’ve scanned your cards, add them to your collection and track your portfolio. Best of all, you can follow other users, message them, trade, buy and sell. \n\nCOLLX CARD SCANNER\t\nCollX’s visual search technology instantly recognizes and matches against a database of 17+ million sports cards. After identifying the best match, you’ll immediately get the current average market price for the card. Our deep-learning models were created by a team with 10+ years experience developing image recognition for everyone from The Home Depot to Tommy Hilfiger to SnipSnap. In addition to being able to match most RAW cards, CollX will also identify graded cards with barcodes, as well as parallel and reprint versions of cards. \n\nGET HISTORICAL PRICING \nCollX uses millions of historical auction prices to calculate a card’s average value. As you add cards to your collection, you’ll see your overall portfolio value grow. Set conditions or grades on your cards and get more accurate prices. As your cards rise or fall in value, CollX helps you track both individual card values and your overall portfolio value. \n\nBUILD YOUR COLLECTION\nCreate and keep track of your collection. View your collection as a grid, list, or as sets. You can also filter and sort your cards by a variety of criteria — value, date added, year, team, etc. \n\nSEARCH CARDS\nSearch 17+ million cards in our database. See what cards on CollX are listed for sale right in search results. And if you find a card you own, but don’t have it handy to scan, you can easily add it from any of the records in the CollX database.\n\nCONNECT WITH FRIENDS AND COLLECTORS\nConnect your address book and CollX will show you who you know on the app. Follow other users by searching for them on the app’s universal search function and selecting the Users tab. Invite your friends to join and find out what their cards are worth!"

Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams.

      "label": "Discover the next evolution of game management with the Moultrie Mobile Cellular Trail Camera System.\n\nReceive your trail camera images on your smartphone, computer or tablet with the Moultrie Mobile app. Monitoring remote property has never been easier or more affordable. View your game camera images whenever, wherever and however you prefer using the Moultrie Mobile app. The Moultrie Mobile app works in combination with Moultrie Mobile Cellular Cameras and Field Modems. The application enables users to receive Moultrie game camera pictures directly to their mobile devices without having to drive or step foot on their property. Plus, you can remotely change all of your game cameras settings from the comfort of your own home while using the app.\n\nThe Moultrie Mobile app is a powerful hunting tool that harnesses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to quickly scan photos for deer, buck, doe, turkey, person and vehicle. With the touch of a button, users can quickly choose to look at buck images only or turkey pics only. Inside that app you can setup custom notifications to alert you when a person, vehicle, buck or more is caught on one of your mobile cameras. App users also have access to and full use of Moultrie’s Interactive Maps. With interactive maps you can completely map out your hunting property by dropping pins of Mobile cameras, treestands, shooting houses, food plots, bedding areas and even for blood trailing in real time. Use the maps feature to pinpoint how bucks are moving through your property so that you can come up with the best game plan possible. The Moultrie Mobile app is also loaded with user-friendly filters to help you quickly decipher deer movement based off of time, temp, date, moon phase, barometric pressure, day/night images and more! Plus, when using Moultrie Mobile you receive 24/7 cloud-based storage of all your images and they will never be deleted. Even if you cancel your plan, the images are yours to view anytime. You can even download high-resolution images of those big-buck pics you’ll receive on the app. \n\nThe Moultrie Mobile system is simple: Use the app or go to www.moultriemobile.com, create an account and register your Moultrie Mobile Cellular Trail Camera or Field Modem. The Moultrie Mobile app features a built-in scanner to quickly and easily register your Moultrie Mobile device. Simply scan the label on the inside of the camera door and the app will autofill the important information so you don’t have to type it out. From the same dashboard, choose an appropriate plan with nationwide coast to coast coverage — no contract required, and it doesn’t matter who your cell phone carrier is! Next, add the approved batteries and SD card to your camera and follow set-up instructions. Once the camera is taking and sending test images, log into the Moultrie Mobile app and view them. Now, you’re ready to deploy your Moultrie Mobile cameras in the field. It’s that Easy!"

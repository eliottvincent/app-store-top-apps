      "label": "CollX (pronounced “collects”) answers the question every collector has: “What’s it worth?” The app lets you scan any baseball, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, or wrestling card and instantly identify it and get the average market value. Once you’ve scanned your cards, add them to your collection and track your portfolio. Best of all, you can follow other users, message them, trade, buy and sell. \n\nCOLLX CARD SCANNER\t\nCollX’s visual search technology instantly recognizes and matches against a database of 17+ million sports cards. After identifying the best match, you’ll immediately get the current average market price for the card. Our deep-learning models were created by a team with 10+ years experience developing image recognition for everyone from The Home Depot to Tommy Hilfiger to SnipSnap. In addition to being able to match most RAW cards, CollX will also identify graded cards with barcodes, as well as parallel and reprint versions of cards. \n\nGET HISTORICAL PRICING \nCollX uses millions of historical auction prices to calculate a card’s average value. As you add cards to your collection, you’ll see your overall portfolio value grow. Set conditions or grades on your cards and get more accurate prices. As your cards rise or fall in value, CollX helps you track both individual card values and your overall portfolio value. \n\nBUILD YOUR COLLECTION\nCreate and keep track of your collection. View your collection as a grid, list, or as sets. You can also filter and sort your cards by a variety of criteria — value, date added, year, team, etc. \n\nSEARCH CARDS\nSearch 17+ million cards in our database. See what cards on CollX are listed for sale right in search results. And if you find a card you own, but don’t have it handy to scan, you can easily add it from any of the records in the CollX database.\n\nCONNECT WITH FRIENDS AND COLLECTORS\nConnect your address book and CollX will show you who you know on the app. Follow other users by searching for them on the app’s universal search function and selecting the Users tab. Invite your friends to join and find out what their cards are worth!"

The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

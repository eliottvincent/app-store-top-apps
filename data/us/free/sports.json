      "label": "CollX (pronounced “collects”) answers the question every collector has: “What’s it worth?” The app lets you scan any baseball, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, or wrestling card and instantly identify it and get the average market value. Once you’ve scanned your cards, add them to your collection and track your portfolio. Best of all, you can follow other users, message them, trade, buy and sell. \n\nCOLLX CARD SCANNER\t\nCollX’s visual search technology instantly recognizes and matches against a database of 17+ million sports cards. After identifying the best match, you’ll immediately get the current average market price for the card. Our deep-learning models were created by a team with 10+ years experience developing image recognition for everyone from The Home Depot to Tommy Hilfiger to SnipSnap. In addition to being able to match most RAW cards, CollX will also identify graded cards with barcodes, as well as parallel and reprint versions of cards. \n\nGET HISTORICAL PRICING \nCollX uses millions of historical auction prices to calculate a card’s average value. As you add cards to your collection, you’ll see your overall portfolio value grow. Set conditions or grades on your cards and get more accurate prices. As your cards rise or fall in value, CollX helps you track both individual card values and your overall portfolio value. \n\nBUILD YOUR COLLECTION\nCreate and keep track of your collection. View your collection as a grid, list, or as sets. You can also filter and sort your cards by a variety of criteria — value, date added, year, team, etc. \n\nSEARCH CARDS\nSearch 17+ million cards in our database. See what cards on CollX are listed for sale right in search results. And if you find a card you own, but don’t have it handy to scan, you can easily add it from any of the records in the CollX database.\n\nCONNECT WITH FRIENDS AND COLLECTORS\nConnect your address book and CollX will show you who you know on the app. Follow other users by searching for them on the app’s universal search function and selecting the Users tab. Invite your friends to join and find out what their cards are worth!"

The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN.

From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

      "label": "Mojo is the ultimate asset in sports — a new way to invest in NFL and NCAA athletes' career performances, just like a stock.\n\nINTRODUCING MOJO\n﻿Finally, you can turn your sports knowledge into real cash by investing in an athlete’s entire career. Prices rise and fall with every hit, huddle, and headline — and you can buy & sell instantly, or hold for as long as you want.\n\nMojo is available in New Jersey, licensed by the NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement. We’ll be coming to more states with legal sports betting soon. Not in Jersey? You can still compare athletes and see real-time price movement.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n• Owning a stock entitles you to a guaranteed retirement payout, based on an objective statistical formula.\n• The share price is the market's expectations for an athlete’s retirement payout value.\n• Expectations (and therefore share prices) change constantly.\n• Prior to retirement, you can buy & sell anytime, or hold as long as you want.\n\nHOW SHARE PRICES MOVE\n• Share prices move with performance, news, and anything else that affects the market’s expectations for career-ending value.\n• Price and performance are connected. As an athlete exceeds expectations, their stock price goes up. (And vice versa.) The best athletes have the highest share prices.\n\nHOW YOU MAKE MONEY\n• Think they’re underrated? Go Long to make money as the stock price rises.\n• Think they’re overrated? Go Short to make money as the stock price drops.\n• Buy the dip, sell at the peak, or hold a rising superstar. You’re in control.\n• Customize your risk/reward and juice your returns with free Multipliers.\n\nWHAT SETS MOJO APART\n• Guaranteed retirement payout: Every Mojo stock has real value, based on real stats. Bet smart to earn bigger payouts.\n• Total control: Cash out anytime you want to, with world-class liquidity — no buyer/seller match necessary. This isn’t an all-or-nothing bet.\n• 300+ NFL players: Find unknown diamonds in the rough before they break out.\n• 100+ NCAA football players: Invest in the next big NFL star before anyone else. (Only their NFL career stats…college stats don't count)\n• No off days, no off-season: Year-round price movement means the action never stops.\n• Low, transparent fee: See the fee before you make your trade.\n• Responsible investing: Mojo has regulatory oversight and controls so you can set limits on deposits, screentime, and more.\n• Industry-best customer support: 9am-1am, seven days a week.\n\nWHAT MAKES MOJO LEGIT\n• Licensed by the New Jersey State Division of Gaming Enforcement.\n• Secure online banking for deposits & withdrawals via Plaid.\n• Guaranteed payouts, backed by best-in-class funding and proper financial reserves.\n\nCONTACT SUPPORT\nCall or text us at 1-855-908-MOJO or email help@mojo.com.\n\n• • •\n\nInvesting is risky, and you should always consider your objectives and risks carefully before trading. \n\nFull terms and conditions: mojo.com/terms\n\nMust be 21+ years of age and physically located in the state of New Jersey to place your bet.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, counseling and services are available at 1-800-GAMBLER﻿﻿﻿"

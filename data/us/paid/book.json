The Jesus Calling App is the mobile version of the time-tested classic packed with digital features that make this daily devotional more accessible than ever:\n\n  * Full devotional text and fully written-out Scriptures\n  * Search by keyword, date, topic, and verse\n  * Share devotional excerpts and inspirational quotes on social media\n  * Functions as a prayer journal app – keep notes for each devotion\n  * Shop for other Sarah Young devotions inside the app\n  * Easy access to the Jesus Calling community – free podcasts, blogs, and more\n\nExperience a deeper relationship with Jesus as you savor the presence of the One who understands you perfectly and loves you forever. With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

      "label": "Based on Joyce Meyer's New York Times bestseller Power Thoughts, this devotional includes 365 opportunities to tap into God's power in your daily life by thinking and speaking His way. The POWER THOUGHTS DEVOTIONAL will provide you with life-changing declarations of truth, directly from God's Word, to think and speak over your life every day of the year.\n\nThis daily app has a devotion search feature, customized daily push notifications, and the ability to combine your favorite passages with images into beautiful shareable 'Quotos'! \n\nProverbs 18:21 says, \"Death and life are in the power of the tongue.\" Simply put, words are containers for power--positive or negative, creative or destructive. Therefore, it is imperative that you learn to think and speak on purpose, using the life-giving wisdom in God's Word. When you do, your life will never be the same!\n\nIf you struggle with being negative, critical, or judgmental of people and situations, don't be discouraged. God wants to help you renew your mind to think and speak as He would. It won't happen overnight--but each day you will make progress as you choose power thoughts to be more like Jesus.\n\nIt's time for you to experience and enjoy the life God created you to live, and Joyce wants to help you get there. You can do it with this devotional by learning how to think and speak power thoughts daily."

The incarnation (the eternal Word becoming man) is the most accurate and articulate translation. Jesus came to reveal you!\n\nAny sincere student of classical music would sensitively seek to capture and interpret the piece, so as not to distract from the original sound of the composition.\n\nTo form a conclusion in the study of our origin would involve a peering over the Creator’s shoulder as it were, in order to gaze through his eyes and marvel at his anticipation. His invisible image and likeness is about to be unveiled in human form!\n\nThe incarnation celebrates the fact that the destiny of the Word was not the page but tangible human life! The word of truth preserves God’s original idea in the resonance of our hearts.\n\n2 Corinthians 3:2: Instead of an impressive certificate framed on my wall I have you framed in my heart! You are our Epistle written within us, an open letter speaking a global language; one that everyone can read[1] and recognize as their mother tongue! (The word [1]anaginosko, from ana, upward and ginosko, to know upward; thus to draw knowledge from a higher reference; from above; to recognize; to read with recognition.)\n\n2 Corinthians 3:3: The fact that you are a Christ-Epistle shines as bright as day! This is what our ministry is all about. The Spirit of God is the living ink. Every trace of the Spirit’s influence on the heart is what gives permanence to this conversation. We are not talking law-language here; this is more dynamic and permanent than letters chiseled in stone. This conversation is embroidered in your inner consciousness. (It is the life of your design that grace echoes within you!)\n\nBehold how beautiful\nhow valuable\nhow loved\nyou are!\n\nYou will rediscover your identity in the very image of the invisible God.\n\nhttps://www.mirrorword.net \nSubscribe to Francois facebook updates http://www.facebook.com/francois.toit\nThe Mirror Translation fb group http://www.facebook.com/groups/179109018883718 \n\n---\n\nAbout Content Rights:\n\nCopyright © 2012 by Francois du Toit.

Double tap on a panel and watch the app automatically detect its boundaries and zoom in on it.\n    3. Tap on the side of the screen to easily move to the next panel. If needed, the app will rotate the comic to make maximum use of your screen space.\n\nKey Features\n============\nSmart Reader:\n    - Automatically zoom in and move between panels for a smooth reading experience.\n    - Works with any comic, western or manga, no matter the art style. Panels do not need well-defined edges to be detected.\n    - Always stay in control, let the app guide you over the page while you can always manually zoom and pan.\n\nComic Collection:\n    - Import comics from anywhere and organize your comic collection.\n    - Comics are stored in iCloud to save storage space and keep your collection in sync across devices.\n    - Your Smart Comic Reader collection is a regular folder on your iCloud Drive that you can access and manage from any iCloud connected device, like a Mac, or a Windows device using iCloud for Windows.\n    - Also works locally if iCloud is disabled.\n    - Supports comics in CBZ/ZIP, CBR/RAR and PDF formats.\n\nAnd many more features to come!\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to send them to: support@vandijk.dev.\n\n\n\nComics in video and screenshots:\n“Pepper&Carrot”, David Revoy, CC-By\n“Plastic Man”, Quality Comics, Public Domain\n“Say Hello to Black Jack”, Shuho Sato"

Since ancient times these plants have been used for magick.\n\n Through the medicinal properties of plants are fairly known- many or the most widely prescribed drugs are synthesized versions of substances originally derived from plants- their occult powers are less accessible. Much of their magick still lies in of shadow of secrecy.\n\n Our ancestors knew that plants had mysterious, magickal powers. Although the magick in herbs has been forgotten by many, it never disappeared.\n\n If you are working on a oil, or a herbal bag, and want the herb for its scent, then work out a herb that smells similar and use that.  The lists of the magickal properties for the herbs give a few options, you can use one, two, or all of those herbs if you wish to. \n\n When you pick plants, you should always thank their spirit.  Basically you are saying that you thank them for their service to you.  You should only take as much of the plant as you need, and you should never pick small plants, remember to leave enough of the plant so that it can regenerate itself  Some people like to leave an offering at the base of the tree/plant, something like a crystal or perhaps some organic matter to feed the plant.\n\n The application contains information about more than 200 herbs and their magickal use. No internet connection is required to display the items.\n\n \n Features: Over 200 plants and their magickal properties.\n   Share items with your friends via email, Facebook, Twitter or message.\n   Add items to favorites.\n   Search through the list for a specific item."

Sandra Boynton’s best-selling book of all time comes alive with sound and movement and gloriously unpredictable interactivity. The wryly inventive Moo, Baa, La La La! digital book app will intrigue and amuse little kids and big people alike, and perhaps even elicit an appreciative snort from the occasional uninvited rhinoceros. \n\n“This is my second digital book project with the perfectly wonderful team at Loud Crow,” says Sandra Boynton, “and I’m really happy with what we’ve created together. As with The Going to Bed Book, our interactive book app version of Moo, Baa, La La La! succeeds in retaining the original board book experience, while adding multi-sensory dimension. It’s such a cool enterprise.” \n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Moo, Baa, La La La! interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery. Of course you can hear each animal make its unique sound. (In some cases, VERY unique.) But there’s more! Help the perplexed chicken stagehand raise the curtain on a stageful of dapper dancing pigs. Turn day to night with the touch of the moon. Slingshot the running cats away from the barking dogs. A touch of the duck activates a quack which brings in another duck. And another. And another. Even the back cover has a curiously articulate spokesman that you really mustn’t miss. \n\nFeatures:  \n\n* The second Boynton Moo Media book app (following their top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app), venturing far beyond what an e-book experience can offer\n * Touch the animals to hear them moo or oink or quack or even, in the case of three incongruous showbiz pigs, harmonize \n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations for her most popular book ever, Moo, Baa, La La La! (over 5 million in print!) \n* Includes an original instrumental soundtrack, \"Country Air\"; a wonderful uptempo pastoral string quartet written by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book \n* \"The Big Guy Reads It\"; with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” and hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

      "label": "Written by popular self-help author Melody Beattie, More Language of Letting Go provides daily guidance and wisdom for those who struggle with codependency and want to change or leave a difficult relationship as well as those in recovery from an addiction. Many people who are looking to work on their personal growth or increase their peace and joy also find this app inspirational and helpful.\r\n\r\nThe app contains all 366 motivational readings from Beattie’s best-selling book, one for each day of the year. It is a companion to “The Language of Letting Go” and can be used by itself or in conjunction with that title. When the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading.

These are generally Neopagan religions based on the deities, symbols, practices, seasonal days of celebration and other surviving components of ancient religions, which had been long suppressed.\n\nPaganism refers to the authentic religions of ancient Greece and Rome as well as surrounding areas. It originated from the Neolithic (Stone Age) era. The term, pagan, is derived from the Latin word, paganus, which means a country dweller. The pagan usually has a belief in many gods (polytheistic), but only one is chosen as the one to worship which represents the chief god and supreme godhead. \n\nMany Pagan deities are associated with various aspects of the human experience, such as love, death, marriage, fertility, healing, war, and so forth. Still others are connected to different phases of the agricultural cycle, the moon, and the sun.

      "label": "** Children's Technology Review Editor's Choice\n\n“OOPS…” Blue Hat, Green Hat, Sandra Boynton’s famous and funny book, comes alive with sound and zestily ingenious interactivity. This wonderfully clever digital book app will surprise kids and grownups alike. Turkeys may also enjoy it, if they can ever figure out how to turn the dang thing on.\n\nThree earnest animals and one misguided turkey learn colors and clothes. Though admittedly, the turkey never quite gets the hang of it.\n\n“I have a particular fondness for Blue Hat, Green Hat. At age three, my son Devin had a surprisingly hearty laugh for a small person—a laugh that would make everyone else laugh. I created this book long ago specifically to elicit that belly-laugh from him. It was great fun to re-invent this book as an interactive e-book app, collaborating again with my endlessly clever Loud Crow friends. The digital dimension gave us so many terrific opportunities for adding theatrical flair to this spare yet decidedly Vaudeville book.” - Sandra Boynton\n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Blue Hat, Green Hat interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery.\n\nThe third Sandra Boynton book app, all of them created in collaboration between Boynton Moo Media along with the award-winning developer Loud Crow Interactive. Blue Hat, Green Hat follows their wonderful top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app, and the glorious bestselling Moo, Baa, La La La! app\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Touch the animals to prompt them to move and respond.\n* Touch “OOPS” to cause a different surprise on each page.\n* Tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade.\n* Dress the turkey with colorful pop-in/pop-out clothes\n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations, and also added new touch-animations\n* Wonderful resonant and wry narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer\n* Includes a original sounds and soundtrack, “William Mattel Overture,” a melody for toy crank-guitar, written by Sandra Boynton, performed by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book\n* “The Big Guy Reads It” narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” to hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

      "label": "The Waste Land brings alive the most revolutionary poem of the last hundred years for a 21st Century audience. A wealth of interactive features illuminate T. S. Eliot's greatest work.\n\nThis digital edition carefully respects the typography and integrity of the original yet offers spectacular new ways to explore the significance and influence of the poem.\n\n• watch a remarkable specially filmed performance of the entire poem by Fiona Shaw, synchronised to the text\n• listen to complete audio readings of the poem, also synchronised to the text, by T. S. Eliot himself (readings from two periods in his life) as well as Ted Hughes, Alec Guinness, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons with Eileen Atkins\n• understand the poem’s many references and allusions with the help of comprehensive interactive notes\n• reveal the structure of the verse and move quickly between sections with a new navigation tool\n• watch over 35 expert video perspectives on the poem including contributions from Seamus Heaney and Jeanette Winterson \n• examine original manuscript pages to see how the poem took shape under Ezra Pound’s editing\n\n------------\n\nWinner Best Adult App at the FutureBook Awards 2011\nWinner International Interaction Design Award 2013\n\n------------\n\n“As someone coming from the wrong side of the two cultures, Eliot's poem had effectively been closed off to me for decades. Now it isn't, and that in itself would almost justify the price of the iPad that made it possible.”\n-The Guardian, UK, John Naughton\n\n------------\n\nThe Waste Land is published jointly by Faber and Faber and RGB. Faber is the London publisher where Eliot himself worked for almost four decades; RGB is behind other revolutionary interactive books for iPad including The Elements and Solar System which are defining the future of publishing. The interviews and Fiona Shaw's performance are specially filmed by Adam Low, director of the BBC Arena documentary on Eliot.\n\nPublication of The Waste Land in 1922 was a milestone in the literary history of the 20th Century. This edition carries forward Eliot's vision and vividly demonstrates how literature can be illuminated by the new digital medium."

Our interactive book app version of my book manages to both retain the original board book experience, and add subtle and captivating dimension to it. It’s such wonderful fun. And oh! I am so smitten by Billy J. Kramer’s infinitely reassuring narration for this, and Michael Ford’s understated and lovely piano composition.” - Sandra Boynton \n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, The Going to Bed Book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and thoroughly mesmerizing and delightful discovery.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Imagine! An ark that rocks.\n\n* Touch, pull, and turn animals and objects to make them move, or tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade \n\n* Tap water that turns on and off, and steam that fogs the screen. Can you write your name in the steam? Of course!\n\n* There are teeth to brush, and a group exercise session with ten pajama-clad animals (big and small) each with its own unique exercise.\n\n* Help the little piggy turn off the lights, then rock yourself to sleep to the music box sound of beautiful twinkling stars.\n\n* There's something wonderful to discover on every page.\n\n* \"The Big Guy Reads It\" narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills \n\n* Or “I want to read it myself” and hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\n* Wonderful resonant and gentle narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer \n\n* Boynton’s original text and illustrations for her popular The Going to Bed Book (over 5 million in print!) \n\nBoynton adds, “Of course The Going to Bed Book app is first and foremost for children, and I know they will be captivated and delighted. But it’s also perfect for agitated high-level executives. What a great evening-time alternative to reviewing the minutes of last week’s Near-Term Strategic Wombat Acquisitions meeting.” \n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

There is a wide variety of books, something for everyone. I would use \"Quickreader- Young Readers\" with all students from 4th grade and beyond. The material is too advanced and the speed too high for any younger readers.”\nMrs. James – Customer review\n\n“…a much-needed breath of fresh air to the world of speed reading apps.” \nReadWriteWeb (http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/quickreader_iphone_app_teaches_you_to_read_faster.php)\n\n\"… a speed-reading tool that can produce remarkable results.

      "label": "Rod Machado’s Instrument Pilot’s Handbook – Second Edition, 626 full color pages\n\nRod Machado's Instrument Pilot's Handbook is a teaching tour de force that takes pilots through the complex world of instrument flying. \n\nLong known for his unique ability to transform difficult concepts into simple-yet-complete explanations, Machado takes both new and experienced IFR pilots on a guided tour of instrument flying, from the basics through subtleties that even many professional pilots will find useful. He turns complexity into curiosity. Nearly 1,000 illustrations shine further light on the topic at hand.\n\nFrom how the basic aircraft instruments really work through what's inside a thunderstorm and how a GPS approach works, Machado teaches IFR pilots not just the minimum needed to pass the instrument pilot written exam, but every aspect of IFR flying. This up-to-date text covers the latest information on GPS, glass cockpits, data uplinks, computer-based resources, and other new (and future) technologies and techniques. It is also a rich source of practical information about how real pilots really fly IFR. Readers learn how to gauge the thunderstorm potential of a cumulus cloud by estimating the rainfall rate, scan their instruments in a way that provides maximum performance with minimum effort, and keep the needle centered during an ILS or LPV approach by using the sky pointer on the attitude indicator. \n\nThere's flying by the book, and then there's flying by THIS book. Rod Machado's Instrument Pilot's Handbook is fun, thorough, and the next best thing to having Rod Machado sit by a pilot's side and talk him through each topic. Once again, Machado proves that you can have fun while learning what you need to know in order to fly safely.\n\nAs a comprehensive information source book, these pages include:\n\n-Simplification of the FAA’s instrument scan concepts and an easy-to-use, cockpit-practical instrument scan technique\n\n-Latest information on aviation decision making for instrument pilots\n\n-Detailed understanding of analog and glass (PFD) flight instruments\n\n-Detailed procedures for planning an IFR cross-country flight\n\n-Easy to apply navigation methods for VOR, GPS, ADF and for flying approaches to LPV, LNAV, LNAV/VNAV minimums\n\n-Clear, down-to-earth explanations of pertinent FARs, including instrument currency, lost comm, alternate requirements, etc. \n\n-Step-by-step explanation of how instrument approach charts are constructed, including MDAs, DAs, procedure turns, etc.\n\n-Practical understanding of the IFR system, GPS procedures, icing and thunderstorm avoidance, NEXRAD, RADAR, etc."

Bukhari finished his work around 846, and spent the last twenty-four years of his life visiting other cities and scholars, teaching the hadith he had collected. In every city that Bukhari visited, thousands of people would gather in the main mosque to listen to him recite traditions. \n\nDistinctive features\nAmin Ahsan Islahi, the notable Islamic scholar, has listed three outstanding qualities of Sahih al-Bukhari:[10]\n\nQuality and soundness of the chain of narrators of the selected ahādīth. Muhammad al-Bukhari has followed two principal criteria for selecting sound narratives. First, the lifetime of a narrator should overlap with the lifetime of the authority from whom he narrates. Second, it should be verifiable that narrators have met with their source persons. They should also expressly state that they obtained the narrative from these authorities. This is a stricter criterion than that set by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj."

The app offers Read to Me or Let Me Play modes. The former is especially delightful. Animations play automatically, which encourages children to listen up, watch, and take a break from tapping their screen. The story's words are highlighted as expressive voice actors read them so that early readers can follow along.\n\nThough in a sense a ghost story, Harry and the Haunted House will inspire more giggles than scares. After Harry hits his baseball a little too far, he and his friends decide to look for it in the abandoned house where it lands. Children will enjoy seeing how Harry and his friends' imaginations create spooky situations. They see ghosts that turn out to be their own reflection, for example, and hear strange noises that are actually Harry's dog playing with the found ball. In the end, children learn that scary things (like old houses, dark closets, or the space under a bed) are not so terrible once one learns more about them.\"\n\n- Parents' Choice   ©2013 Parents' Choice \n\nHave you ever wished you could play inside a story and really interact with all the characters and words? Now you can! Harry and the Haunted House is an imaginative, interactive and slightly spooky reading experience with fully animated content loved by children, parents and teachers alike. \n\nWanderful brings every page of this Mark Schlichting story to life. Read and play along with Harry and his friends as they retrieve their baseball lost in the “haunted” house across the field. “W-W-What’s that noise?” “We froze in our steps…”\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n• Story is in both English and Spanish - change language from any page\n• 12 fully animated pages  \n• French story content unlocks with upgrade\n• Virtually every item on each page comes to life when tapped\n• All words are “active” for extended word play and language learning\n• Animated surprises on each page – can you find all the performing bugs?\n• Move between pages with swipe or with scrolling page navigation\n• Multiple settings to customize the App for your child’s reading experience\n• Two modes: “Read to Me” and the fully interactive “Let Me Play”\n• Parental tips to help you get the most out of this Wanderful interactive storybook\n• Teacher resources include a 31 page overview of Wanderful interactive storybooks Classroom Activities and a free preview of the Harry and the Haunted House Classroom Activities guide \n• The full 58 page Classroom Activities guide is available as an upgrade\n\nWanderful’s goal is to bring outstanding interactive storybooks to a new generation of children. We hope Harry and the Haunted House provides your family, children and students with hours of delightful story play. \n\nHarry and the Haunted House is written by Mark Schlichting, creator of the Living Books series.\n\nPrivacy Disclosure\nWanderful creates engaging interactive storybooks for children that are educational, fun, and above all safe and appropriate.

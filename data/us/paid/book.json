      "label": "Jesus Calling is your yearlong guide to living a more peaceful life. The Jesus Calling App is the mobile version of the time-tested classic packed with digital features that make this daily devotional more accessible than ever:\n\n  * Full devotional text and fully written-out Scriptures\n  * Search by keyword, date, topic, and verse\n  * Share devotional excerpts and inspirational quotes on social media\n  * Functions as a prayer journal app – keep notes for each devotion\n  * Shop for other Sarah Young devotions inside the app\n  * Easy access to the Jesus Calling community – free podcasts, blogs, and more\n\nExperience a deeper relationship with Jesus as you savor the presence of the One who understands you perfectly and loves you forever. With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

      "label": "Written by codependency expert Melody Beattie, the Language of Letting Go provides daily guidance and encouragement for those who struggle with codependency. The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

Many people who are looking to work on their personal growth or increase their peace and joy also find this app inspirational and helpful.\r\n\r\nThe app contains all 366 motivational readings from Beattie’s best-selling book, one for each day of the year. It is a companion to “The Language of Letting Go” and can be used by itself or in conjunction with that title. When the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on the reading.\r\n\r\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: facing fears, getting to know yourself, dealing with grief, finding hope, recognizing manipulation, learning to have fun, and letting go of the things that are holding you back. Some readings feature activities to extend the experience.\r\n\r\nHandy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon are also included in the app.\r\n\r\nBy integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for themselves and their self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\r\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\r\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\r\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\r\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\r\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\r\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\r\nSET your font size using your device settings.\r\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

      "label": "Se’atat, the Horologium\nThe Horologium was composed by distinguished 15th century scholar, Abba Giyorgis of Gascha; during the ensuing it was gradually enriched by additional hymns and prayers. In big churches it is usual for monks, priests and deacons to conduct the Se’atat in the northern part of the ambulatory, while the Debteras are conducting a different service.\n\nThe book of Se’atat contains the great public prayers of the Church, not necessarily said in public but always offered in the name of the church. It is recited at stated hours in churches, monasteries and outside. It is divided into seven parts known as canonical hours and each part is recited at its own hour. These hours are known as Night, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and compline. To be more exact the first of the canonical hours is night or matins (morning office) which is followed by lauds or praises of God. These are reckoned as one “hour”. The next division is prime or first because it is said at “first hour” or sun rise. Then terce or third, recited at the third hour. Sext or sixth at noon; none or ninth at three O’clock; Vespers is next, signifying evening services, and then comes compline or the completion.\n\nThe office contains psalms, discourses by the great fathers of the church, hymns and prayers. This office is an abundant treasure of grace. Deacons stand for the “gibre leilit” or night service and chant the “Se’atat” or Book of hours, serving till dawn. There was an arrangement under which a debtera held some church land and was bound in return to recite the Se’atat or Hours of the night at certain times, or held land for which he was bound to recite the “Hours of the Day” in the church. But the recital of the office is not obligatorily imposed on priests and deacons.\n\n\nFeatures of the App\r\n\r\nTheme\r\n• Material Design color schemes.\r\n• Setting for Night mode and Day Mode\r\n\r\nMultiple book collections\r\n• Add two or more translations to the app.\r\n• Multiple books of Ethiopian prayers\r\n\r\nNavigation\r\n• User can configure the choice of translation and layout within the app.\r\n• Allow swiping between books\r\n• Book names could be displayed as list or grid views\r\n\r\nFonts and Font Sizes\r\n• You can change fonts sizes from toolbar or navigation menu.\r\n• The app uses true type fonts for main view. \r\n\r\nText Copy and Share\r\n• To copy a text to the device clipboard, tap on the text to select it.

Since ancient times these plants have been used for magick.\n\n Through the medicinal properties of plants are fairly known- many or the most widely prescribed drugs are synthesized versions of substances originally derived from plants- their occult powers are less accessible. Much of their magick still lies in of shadow of secrecy.\n\n Our ancestors knew that plants had mysterious, magickal powers. Although the magick in herbs has been forgotten by many, it never disappeared.\n\n If you are working on a oil, or a herbal bag, and want the herb for its scent, then work out a herb that smells similar and use that.  The lists of the magickal properties for the herbs give a few options, you can use one, two, or all of those herbs if you wish to. \n\n When you pick plants, you should always thank their spirit.  Basically you are saying that you thank them for their service to you.  You should only take as much of the plant as you need, and you should never pick small plants, remember to leave enough of the plant so that it can regenerate itself  Some people like to leave an offering at the base of the tree/plant, something like a crystal or perhaps some organic matter to feed the plant.\n\n The application contains information about more than 200 herbs and their magickal use. No internet connection is required to display the items.\n\n \n Features: Over 200 plants and their magickal properties.\n   Share items with your friends via email, Facebook, Twitter or message.\n   Add items to favorites.\n   Search through the list for a specific item."

The Lord has used the programme to: ignite the fire of revival in thousands of lives, put stubborn pursuers to flight, produce prayer eagles, open chapters of prosperity for many, confuse satanic dribblers and put the enemies’ gear in reverse. Prayer is of great value in turbulent and non-turbulent situations. Prayer is a necessity not an option.\n\n“Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by PRAYER AND FASTING” (Matt 17:21).\n\nSome mountains will not fall unless they are bombarded with the artillery of prayer and fasting.\n\nThe weapon of prayer and fasting have been known to do wonders when other methods have failed. In addition,  some breakthroughs are impossible unless there is regular, consistent, concerted, constant bombardment of prayers. \n\nThe prayer points for this year's programme have been specially vomited by the Holy Ghost to bring salvation, deliverance and healing  of the spirit, soul and body to God's people. Pray them with determination, pray them with  aggression, pray them with violence in your spirit, pray them with violent faith, pray them with great expectation and your life will never remain the same. The God who answereth by fire will surely answer you, in Jesus’ name.\n\nYour friend in the school of prayer,\nDr. D. K. OLUKOYA"

      "label": "This Liturgy book app gives directions to ministers and people for conduct of the Holy Communion service. Sacred liturgy is the very heart of Ethiopian Orthodox worship. All the various kinds and types of Orthodox prayer and ritual cluster around the Sacrifice of the Mass which was instituted by the Lord the same night in which He was betrayed \n\nThe Ethiopian Liturgy is divided into two parts, the introductory part called Ordo Communis and the Eucharistic part called Anaphora. The Anaphora is the more solemn portion of the Liturgy, the central point of which is the great Oblation. It commences with the words “Sursum Corda”, or with their equivalents, which occur in all Liturgies, and includes the rest of the services to the end.\n\nThe Anaphoras are officially fourteen, the basic one in normal use being that of the Twelve Apostles. In the some ancient monasteries about six other Anaphoras are used. The Ethiopic Liturgy was the first to be published of all the Oriental Liturgies. It was printed at Rome in 1548.\n\n\nOfficial Anaphoras:\n1) Anaphora of the Apostles\n2) Anaphora of our Lord Jesus Christ\n3) Anaphora of our Lady Mary\n4) Anaphora of St. John Chrysostom\n5) Anaphora of St. Dioscorus\n6) Anaphora of St. John the Evangelist\n7) Anaphora of St. Gregory the Armenian\n8) Anaphora of the 318 Orthodox\n9) Anaphora of St. Athanasius\n10) Anaphora of St.Basil\n11) Anaphora of St. Gregory Nazianzen\n12) Anaphora of St.Epiphanius\n13) Anaphora of St. Cyril\n14) Anaphora of James Serug (The complete Ethiopian Liturgy)\n\n\nFeatures of the App\r\n\r\nTheme\r\n• Material Design color schemes.\r\n• Setting for Night mode and Day Mode\r\n\r\nMultiple book collections\r\n• Add two or more translations to the app.\r\n• Multiple books of Ethiopian prayers\r\n\r\nNavigation\r\n• User can configure the choice of translation and layout within the app.\r\n• Allow swiping between books\r\n• Book names could be displayed as list or grid views\r\n\r\nFonts and Font Sizes\r\n• You can change fonts sizes from toolbar or navigation menu.\r\n• The app uses true type fonts for main view. \r\n\r\nText Copy and Share\r\n• To copy a text to the device clipboard, tap on the text to select it.

S. Eliot himself (readings from two periods in his life) as well as Ted Hughes, Alec Guinness, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons with Eileen Atkins\n• understand the poem’s many references and allusions with the help of comprehensive interactive notes\n• reveal the structure of the verse and move quickly between sections with a new navigation tool\n• watch over 35 expert video perspectives on the poem including contributions from Seamus Heaney and Jeanette Winterson \n• examine original manuscript pages to see how the poem took shape under Ezra Pound’s editing\n\n------------\n\nWinner Best Adult App at the FutureBook Awards 2011\nWinner International Interaction Design Award 2013\n\n------------\n\n“As someone coming from the wrong side of the two cultures, Eliot's poem had effectively been closed off to me for decades. Now it isn't, and that in itself would almost justify the price of the iPad that made it possible.”\n-The Guardian, UK, John Naughton\n\n------------\n\nThe Waste Land is published jointly by Faber and Faber and RGB. Faber is the London publisher where Eliot himself worked for almost four decades; RGB is behind other revolutionary interactive books for iPad including The Elements and Solar System which are defining the future of publishing. The interviews and Fiona Shaw's performance are specially filmed by Adam Low, director of the BBC Arena documentary on Eliot.\n\nPublication of The Waste Land in 1922 was a milestone in the literary history of the 20th Century. This edition carries forward Eliot's vision and vividly demonstrates how literature can be illuminated by the new digital medium."

Double tap on a panel and watch the app automatically detect its boundaries and zoom in on it.\n    3. Tap on the side of the screen to easily move to the next panel. If needed, the app will rotate the comic to make maximum use of your screen space.\n\nKey Features\n============\nSmart Reader:\n    - Automatically zoom in and move between panels for a smooth reading experience.\n    - Works with any comic, western or manga, no matter the art style. Panels do not need well-defined edges to be detected.\n    - Always stay in control, let the app guide you over the page while you can always manually zoom and pan.\n\nComic Collection:\n    - Import comics from anywhere and organize your comic collection.\n    - Comics are stored in iCloud to save storage space and keep your collection in sync across devices.\n    - Your Smart Comic Reader collection is a regular folder on your iCloud Drive that you can access and manage from any iCloud connected device, like a Mac, or a Windows device using iCloud for Windows.\n    - Also works locally if iCloud is disabled.\n    - Supports comics in CBZ/ZIP, CBR/RAR and PDF formats.\n\nAnd many more features to come!\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to send them to: support@vandijk.dev.\n\n\n\nComics in video and screenshots:\n“Pepper&Carrot”, David Revoy, CC-By\n“Plastic Man”, Quality Comics, Public Domain\n“Say Hello to Black Jack”, Shuho Sato"

The POWER THOUGHTS DEVOTIONAL will provide you with life-changing declarations of truth, directly from God's Word, to think and speak over your life every day of the year.\n\nThis daily app has a devotion search feature, customized daily push notifications, and the ability to combine your favorite passages with images into beautiful shareable 'Quotos'! \n\nProverbs 18:21 says, \"Death and life are in the power of the tongue.\" Simply put, words are containers for power--positive or negative, creative or destructive. Therefore, it is imperative that you learn to think and speak on purpose, using the life-giving wisdom in God's Word. When you do, your life will never be the same!\n\nIf you struggle with being negative, critical, or judgmental of people and situations, don't be discouraged. God wants to help you renew your mind to think and speak as He would. It won't happen overnight--but each day you will make progress as you choose power thoughts to be more like Jesus.\n\nIt's time for you to experience and enjoy the life God created you to live, and Joyce wants to help you get there. You can do it with this devotional by learning how to think and speak power thoughts daily."

The chronology given in Jubilees is based on multiples of seven; the jubilees are periods of 49 years (seven \"year-weeks\"), into which all of time has been divided.\n\nThe Book of Jasher, which means the Book of the Upright or the Book of the Just Man, is a book mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, often interpreted as a lost non-canonical book.\n\nThe Apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nApocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books includes these books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and Laodiceans.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV 1611) are included.\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThank you for using the Books of Jubilees, Jasher, Enoch PRO app."

Others believe it is valid and that it should never have been removed- that it was considered part of the Bible for nearly 2,000 years before it was recently removed a little more than 100 years ago. Some say it was removed because of not finding the books in the original Hebrew manuscripts. Others claim it wasn't removed by the church, but by printers to cut costs in distributing Bibles in the United States. Both sides tend to cite the same verses that warn against adding or subtracting from the Bible: Revelation 22:18. The word 'apocrypha' means 'hidden.' Fragments of Dead Sea Scrolls dating back to before 70 A.D. contained parts of the apocrypha books in Hebrew, including Sirach and Tobit.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download within the app for free.\n\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version.

      "label": "Hyphen is a powerful, easy-to-use ePub reader designed from the ground up with you in mind, with cross-device syncing, super-fast rendering, effortless customization, and intuitive annotation features.\n\n■ CROSS-DEVICE SYNCING\n\nStart on one device, finish on another. Your entire library - books, annotations, bookmarks, and all - is synced between devices via iCloud.\n\n■ PERSONALIZE YOUR READING EXPERIENCE\n\nHyphen comes packed with a ton of options for custom colors, fonts, font sizes, line heights, paragraph indentations, margins - ...well, you get the idea. You can even use styling on a per-book basis.\n\nAnd if that’s not enough, you can also add your own CSS. Cool, right?\n\n■ HIGHLIGHT AND ANNOTATE EFFORTLESSLY\n\nTap-and-drag or use the selection handles to highlight in any one of several available colors. Write notes for a highlight and refer to them any time you need to. You can also share highlights as images and post them to Twitter or Facebook, or export all your highlights  for use elsewhere.\n\n■ GOODREADS INTEGRATION\n\nUse Goodreads? We've got you covered - shelve books, make status updates and post quotes, all right from the app.\n\n■ ADD BOOKS WITH EASE\n\nAdd ePubs using your favorite cloud services - Dropbox, Google Drive, OPDS servers, and more. You can also use the in-app web browser to download ePubs, or add them using iTunes.\n\n======\n\nOTHER NOTABLE  FEATURES:\n\n■ NIGHT MODE\nTransition Hyphen's reading interface to soothing, darker colors at night.\n\n■ METADATA\nEdit the title, author, subjects, covers and more of your books. Hyphen can even lookup book covers and metadata for you.\n\n■ SHELVE & SORT\nAdd books to custom shelves, and sort by author, title, last read, or date added.\n\n■ CUSTOM CSS & FONTS\nHyphen lets you import both your favorite fonts for use while reading, as well as CSS.\n\n■ DEFINE & TRANSLATE\nTranslations of the text you're reading are only a tap away. Lookup words and terms in Wikipedia, Dictionary.com or Google.\n\n■ TWO COLUMN SUPPORT\nGot one of those large, spacious, king-sized, oh-my-lord-this-screen-is-so-big-I-should've-gotten-an-ipad-mini-instead,-its-so-big, why-is-it-so-big-sized screens? Use this setting to make reading more comfortable. You can also optionally only use two columns when your device is in landscape orientation.\n\n■ VOCABULARY\nAdd words to a vocabulary list and export them easily.\n\n■ INTERACTIVE\nTap and hold a link to open it in the in-app browser, or Safari. Images zoom in, letting you see every detail. Swipe through and jump between images throughout the text with the Image Viewer.\n\n■ ADE PAGES SUPPORT\nHyphen utilizes ADE pages, so you’ll always have a cross-reader compatible way of finding and noting where you are in a book.\n\n■ INCREDIBLY FAST\nDownload and import books in the blink of an eye. Hyphen’s ePub Rendering System is optimized so that there’s the least delay between you and the text.\n\n======\n\nCONTACT & SUPPORT\n\nNeed help or have a question? Tweet me @hyphenreader on twitter, or email me at hyphenreader@gmail.com."

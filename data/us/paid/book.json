      "label": "Jesus Calling is your yearlong guide to living a more peaceful life. The Jesus Calling App is the mobile version of the time-tested classic packed with digital features that make this daily devotional more accessible than ever:\n\n  * Full devotional text and fully written-out Scriptures\n  * Search by keyword, date, topic, and verse\n  * Share devotional excerpts and inspirational quotes on social media\n  * Functions as a prayer journal app – keep notes for each devotion\n  * Shop for other Sarah Young devotions inside the app\n  * Easy access to the Jesus Calling community – free podcasts, blogs, and more\n\nExperience a deeper relationship with Jesus as you savor the presence of the One who understands you perfectly and loves you forever. With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

First published in 1890 with the help of more than one hundred colleagues, Strong's remains the most widely used concordance and dictionary of Bible words from the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nThis updated edition of Strong's Exhaustive Concordance takes James Strong's monumental work and updates it to be even more useful to the modern reader. It maintains all of the features that have made Strong's indispensable for over 100 years: \n- Allows the reader to easily find all biblical occurrences of a word in the King James Version\n- Points the reader to the underlying Hebrew and Greek words\n- Uses the Strong's numbering system which is used in many of the new study tools of today \n\nAnd adds new features that make it even more useful: \n- Corrected, updated, and expanded using the latest computing search tools\n- Extra-clear font and page design make this edition readable and easy to navigate\n- Updated and improved Hebrew and Greek dictionaries tie each word to the Greek or Hebrew root\n- Discover the Hebrew and Greek words underlying the KJV English using the Strong's numbering system\n- Use the updated Hebrew and Greek dictionaries to find brief definitions of each word of the original languages\n\nGo beyond mere searches for lost verses and hone your skills by utilizing this tool's more advanced features.\n\nFind every occurrence of any word in the King James Version Bible. Only the words not likely to be used in locating a passage have been eliminated (words such as should, those, and when) or condensed to include only the important occurrences (words such as bring, day, and might). \n\nStudents of the Bible utilize the wealth of resources offered in Strong's ranging from doing word and thematic studies to probing the deeper meanings embedded in the original languages of the Bible."

      "label": "The Waste Land brings alive the most revolutionary poem of the last hundred years for a 21st Century audience. A wealth of interactive features illuminate T. S. Eliot's greatest work.\n\nThis digital edition carefully respects the typography and integrity of the original yet offers spectacular new ways to explore the significance and influence of the poem.\n\n• watch a remarkable specially filmed performance of the entire poem by Fiona Shaw, synchronised to the text\n• listen to complete audio readings of the poem, also synchronised to the text, by T. S. Eliot himself (readings from two periods in his life) as well as Ted Hughes, Alec Guinness, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons with Eileen Atkins\n• understand the poem’s many references and allusions with the help of comprehensive interactive notes\n• reveal the structure of the verse and move quickly between sections with a new navigation tool\n• watch over 35 expert video perspectives on the poem including contributions from Seamus Heaney and Jeanette Winterson \n• examine original manuscript pages to see how the poem took shape under Ezra Pound’s editing\n\n------------\n\nWinner Best Adult App at the FutureBook Awards 2011\nWinner International Interaction Design Award 2013\n\n------------\n\n“As someone coming from the wrong side of the two cultures, Eliot's poem had effectively been closed off to me for decades. Now it isn't, and that in itself would almost justify the price of the iPad that made it possible.”\n-The Guardian, UK, John Naughton\n\n------------\n\nThe Waste Land is published jointly by Faber and Faber and RGB. Faber is the London publisher where Eliot himself worked for almost four decades; RGB is behind other revolutionary interactive books for iPad including The Elements and Solar System which are defining the future of publishing. The interviews and Fiona Shaw's performance are specially filmed by Adam Low, director of the BBC Arena documentary on Eliot.\n\nPublication of The Waste Land in 1922 was a milestone in the literary history of the 20th Century. This edition carries forward Eliot's vision and vividly demonstrates how literature can be illuminated by the new digital medium."

Some readings feature activities to extend the experience.\r\n\r\nHandy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon are also included in the app.\r\n\r\nBy integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for themselves and their self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\r\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\r\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\r\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\r\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\r\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\r\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\r\nSET your font size using your device settings.\r\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

      "label": "** Children's Technology Review Editor's Choice\n\n“OOPS…” Blue Hat, Green Hat, Sandra Boynton’s famous and funny book, comes alive with sound and zestily ingenious interactivity. This wonderfully clever digital book app will surprise kids and grownups alike. Turkeys may also enjoy it, if they can ever figure out how to turn the dang thing on.\n\nThree earnest animals and one misguided turkey learn colors and clothes. Though admittedly, the turkey never quite gets the hang of it.\n\n“I have a particular fondness for Blue Hat, Green Hat. At age three, my son Devin had a surprisingly hearty laugh for a small person—a laugh that would make everyone else laugh. I created this book long ago specifically to elicit that belly-laugh from him. It was great fun to re-invent this book as an interactive e-book app, collaborating again with my endlessly clever Loud Crow friends. The digital dimension gave us so many terrific opportunities for adding theatrical flair to this spare yet decidedly Vaudeville book.” - Sandra Boynton\n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Blue Hat, Green Hat interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery.\n\nThe third Sandra Boynton book app, all of them created in collaboration between Boynton Moo Media along with the award-winning developer Loud Crow Interactive. Blue Hat, Green Hat follows their wonderful top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app, and the glorious bestselling Moo, Baa, La La La! app\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Touch the animals to prompt them to move and respond.\n* Touch “OOPS” to cause a different surprise on each page.\n* Tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade.\n* Dress the turkey with colorful pop-in/pop-out clothes\n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations, and also added new touch-animations\n* Wonderful resonant and wry narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer\n* Includes a original sounds and soundtrack, “William Mattel Overture,” a melody for toy crank-guitar, written by Sandra Boynton, performed by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book\n* “The Big Guy Reads It” narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” to hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

      "label": "Based on Joyce Meyer's New York Times bestseller Power Thoughts, this devotional includes 365 opportunities to tap into God's power in your daily life by thinking and speaking His way. The POWER THOUGHTS DEVOTIONAL will provide you with life-changing declarations of truth, directly from God's Word, to think and speak over your life every day of the year.\n\nThis daily app has a devotion search feature, customized daily push notifications, and the ability to combine your favorite passages with images into beautiful shareable 'Quotos'! \n\nProverbs 18:21 says, \"Death and life are in the power of the tongue.\" Simply put, words are containers for power--positive or negative, creative or destructive. Therefore, it is imperative that you learn to think and speak on purpose, using the life-giving wisdom in God's Word. When you do, your life will never be the same!\n\nIf you struggle with being negative, critical, or judgmental of people and situations, don't be discouraged. God wants to help you renew your mind to think and speak as He would. It won't happen overnight--but each day you will make progress as you choose power thoughts to be more like Jesus.\n\nIt's time for you to experience and enjoy the life God created you to live, and Joyce wants to help you get there. You can do it with this devotional by learning how to think and speak power thoughts daily."

The incarnation (the eternal Word becoming man) is the most accurate and articulate translation. Jesus came to reveal you!\n\nAny sincere student of classical music would sensitively seek to capture and interpret the piece, so as not to distract from the original sound of the composition.\n\nTo form a conclusion in the study of our origin would involve a peering over the Creator’s shoulder as it were, in order to gaze through his eyes and marvel at his anticipation. His invisible image and likeness is about to be unveiled in human form!\n\nThe incarnation celebrates the fact that the destiny of the Word was not the page but tangible human life! The word of truth preserves God’s original idea in the resonance of our hearts.\n\n2 Corinthians 3:2: Instead of an impressive certificate framed on my wall I have you framed in my heart! You are our Epistle written within us, an open letter speaking a global language; one that everyone can read[1] and recognize as their mother tongue! (The word [1]anaginosko, from ana, upward and ginosko, to know upward; thus to draw knowledge from a higher reference; from above; to recognize; to read with recognition.)\n\n2 Corinthians 3:3: The fact that you are a Christ-Epistle shines as bright as day! This is what our ministry is all about. The Spirit of God is the living ink. Every trace of the Spirit’s influence on the heart is what gives permanence to this conversation. We are not talking law-language here; this is more dynamic and permanent than letters chiseled in stone. This conversation is embroidered in your inner consciousness. (It is the life of your design that grace echoes within you!)\n\nBehold how beautiful\nhow valuable\nhow loved\nyou are!\n\nYou will rediscover your identity in the very image of the invisible God.\n\nhttps://www.mirrorword.net \nSubscribe to Francois facebook updates http://www.facebook.com/francois.toit\nThe Mirror Translation fb group http://www.facebook.com/groups/179109018883718 \n\n---\n\nAbout Content Rights:\n\nCopyright © 2012 by Francois du Toit.

It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\n“CHOMP by Christoph Niemann” is the latest imagination from internationally renowned children’s author and illustrator Christoph Niemann, whose App ‘Petting Zoo’ is already loved by millions of children and families around the world.\n\n‘CHOMP’ combines playful, humorous, and lovingly hand-drawn animations with live video, enabling children and adults alike to slip into a variety of comical roles. From a virtuous pianist, to a spaghetti-slurping dog, or a living cuckoo-clock, anything is possible!\n\nWhat makes this App so inspiring and special is that children participate using their own faces, mimicry, and song, allowing their creativity to run free.\n\nWith the video functions, all of these adventures can be saved forever. ‘CHOMP’ is so easy and intuitive to use that kids can create and sing their own personal messages to send to parents, grandparents, friends, or siblings, all in the blink of an eye.\n\nHighlights :\n\n•\tHand drawn animations made with love and care.\n•\tOver 50 hand-drawn scenes with countless funny animations.\n•\tFun for all ages.\n•\tNo language knowledge needed. The app is text-free.\n•\tNo in-app purchases, invasive advertising, or data mining.\n•\tRecord play sessions with integrated video recording.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n•\tChildren can swipe left and right to change animations. Tap the screen to see the fun.\n•\tGrownups can open the camera menu in the bottom left to record videos. Tap to microphone icon to enable sound recording, use the large center button to start and stop video recording.\n•\tPlease enable camera permissions when prompted.\n\nJust as with his App ‘Petting Zoo’ and his New York Times blog ‘Abstract City’, Christoph Niemann uses ‘CHOMP’ to once again show us his own unique, absurd, and always funny view of the world.\n\nPress reviews:\n\nwired.com:\n\"It’s not quite a storybook, and not quite a video game. It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\nPlease also check out our other great App for kids:\n\n“PETTING ZOO” - is a fantastic storybook app. It features beautiful, fun, interactive animations of over 20 animals, and it’s bound to be a big favorite for kids and animal lovers of all ages.\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

Enoch contains unique material on the origins of demons and Nephilim, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why the Genesis flood was morally necessary, and prophetic exposition of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah.\n\nThe Book of Jubilees claims to present \"the history of the division of the days of the Law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the jubilees of the world\" as revealed to Moses (in addition to the Torah or \"Instruction\") by angels while he was on Mount Sinai for forty days and forty nights. The chronology given in Jubilees is based on multiples of seven; the jubilees are periods of 49 years (seven \"year-weeks\"), into which all of time has been divided.\n\nThe Book of Jasher, which means the Book of the Upright or the Book of the Just Man, is a book mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, often interpreted as a lost non-canonical book.\n\nThe Apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nApocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books includes these books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and Laodiceans.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV 1611) are included.\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThank you for using the Books of Jubilees, Jasher, Enoch PRO app."

Double tap on a panel and watch the app automatically detect its boundaries and zoom in on it.\n    3. Tap on the side of the screen to easily move to the next panel. If needed, the app will rotate the comic to make maximum use of your screen space.\n\nKey Features\n============\nSmart Reader:\n    - Automatically zoom in and move between panels for a smooth reading experience.\n    - Works with any comic, western or manga, no matter the art style. Panels do not need well-defined edges to be detected.\n    - Always stay in control, let the app guide you over the page while you can always manually zoom and pan.\n\nComic Collection:\n    - Import comics from anywhere and organize your comic collection.\n    - Comics are stored in iCloud to save storage space and keep your collection in sync across devices.\n    - Your Smart Comic Reader collection is a regular folder on your iCloud Drive that you can access and manage from any iCloud connected device, like a Mac, or a Windows device using iCloud for Windows.\n    - Also works locally if iCloud is disabled.\n    - Supports comics in CBZ/ZIP, CBR/RAR and PDF formats.\n\nAnd many more features to come!\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to send them to: support@vandijk.dev.\n\n\n\nComics in video and screenshots:\n“Pepper&Carrot”, David Revoy, CC-By\n“Plastic Man”, Quality Comics, Public Domain\n“Say Hello to Black Jack”, Shuho Sato"

      "label": "This app presents the lives of the saints of the Ethiopian church. The lives are arranged according to the Ethiopian calendar with the corresponding western Gregorian dates given in the titles.\n\n\nIn Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Synaxarium is the classic, abridged, collection of the “Lives of the Saints,” intended for reading in the context of public worship, and to nourish the personal prayer life of the faithful. As the Church continues its journey toward its fulfillment in the Kingdom of heaven, it does not cease to grow through the addition of new saints in every generation. Thus the Synaxarium is a work which continues to be written, no so much with ink, but with the blood of the martyrs, the tears of the ascetics, and the wondrous deeds of those who love God, in every place where the word of the Gospel has resounded forth.\n\n\nThe world is sanctified, saved and redeemed through the presence of the saints that are in it like the leaven in the loaf, preparing mankind for the final revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ. \n\nThe saints who shine with the divine light have become gods by the grace of the Holy Spirit, to the extent that baptized into Christ they have put on Christ. To the extent that they have taken up their cross with Christ, so as to crucify in themselves the old man, full of passions, sins and all uncleanness, they have been able to share also in the glory of Christ's Resurrection. By partaking in Christ's Passion through martyrdom, ascesis, tears and practice of all the evangelic virtues, the saints have overcome death with Him. They are henceforth alive to God, for Christ has made his abode with them.\n\n\nWe have three ways of bringing the saints daily into our spiritual lives: by chanting the hymns and church services dedicated to them, by venerating their icons and by reading their lives in the Synaxarion. Christians who live in the world may not be able to go to church every day to chant the praises of the saints but, whether alone or in the family, everyone can chant the troparion of the saint of the day, everyone can venerate the icon, everyone can devote a few minutes to reading or reading again the life of the saint in the Synaxarion. But the daily reading of these short accounts will not profit us unless we come to it in the spirit of venerating an icon. For what we read in the Synaxarion, imperfect though it be, makes the saint present to us no less than the figure in the holy icon and is equally grace-bearing. It all depends on our simplicity of heart. And so, wherever we find ourselves, whatever our spiritual level, whatever our desire to dedicate our life to God, we will find new strength in the Synaxarion and a foretaste of everlasting life, where all the saints with the angels around the throne of God will praise his Name.\n\nFeatures of the App\r\n\r\nTheme\r\n• Material Design color schemes.\r\n• Setting for Night mode and Day Mode\r\n\r\nMultiple book collections\r\n• Add two or more translations to the app.\r\n• Multiple books of Ethiopian prayers\r\n\r\n\n\r\nFonts and Font Sizes\r\n• You can change fonts sizes from toolbar or navigation menu.\r\n• The app uses true type fonts for main view. \r\n\r\n\nContents\r\n• Book contents are rearranged and missing parts included\r\n• Colorful texts for the name of God, Jesus, St. Mary and Saints\r\n• Notices and Orders in the book are written in italic for emphasis\r\n\r\nInterface translations\r\n• Added interface translations in English, Amharic and Afaan Oromoo.\r\n• Changing the app Interface language will change menu item’s name.\r\n\r\nSearch\r\n• Powerful and fast search features\r\n• Search the whole words and accents\r\n• Number of search results displayed at the bottom of the page\r\n\r\nSettings screen\r\n• Allow the user of the app to configure the following settings:\r\n• Book selection type: list or grid\r\n• Red Letters: show the name of saints in red"

It is set up for very quick reference and memorization, yet contains full arguments as well as different ways to argue the same topics.\n \nCurrent Rating =  4.66/5\n\nExamples include \"Lack of Historical Evidence for Jesus,\"  \"America Was NOT Created as a Christian Nation,\" and  \"God Is Too Hidden to Be Real,\" as well as others.  Arm yourself with very powerful and logical arguments against religious zealots. \n\nSKEPTICISM section contains many subjects related to being a skeptic. Learn how to debunk claims scientifically in just a few questions with \"Bogus Claims Debunker.\"  Aliens, ghosts, psychics, and get-rich-quick schemes are deconstructed using logic.  Several articles were generously provided by Skeptic magazine!\n\nHUMANISM section is a positive and uplifting area consisting of humanistic articles, including \"Declaration of Human Rights\" and \"Life Is to Be Lived Now,\" to name a few. It shows that most of us share humanistic interests, whether we realize it or not, and science is our most valuable tool for humanity. \"The Humanist Manifesto\" is among several articles provided by the American Humanist Association."

These were originally developed many years ago for desktop computers yet they still hold up on the iPad, as though they were new apps designed just for the tablet. \n\nThe thought and creativity that was put into the interactivity in Berenstain Bears Get Into a Fight is largely unmatched in any other interactive book. When you combine that with a classic Berenstain Bears children's book you have a complete winner.\n\nThis is one of the best eBook apps available for young children, and there are few people of any age that would not enjoy it. Like Wanderful's other apps, Berenstain Bears Get Into a Fight offers great creativity with a wonderful sense of humanity and heart that transcends age. Multi-lingual families can enjoy the story in either Spanish or Portuguese, the latter of which is available via an in-app purchase.”\n\n- Tim Leverett   ©2013 Parents' Choice \n\nHave you ever wished you could play inside a story and really interact with all the characters and words?

Our daughter, on the other hand, appreciates another story from OhNoo studio - \n»Amelia and Terror of the Night«. The protagonist is a girl named Amelia - she’s exactly like our daughter.”\n\n5/5 – “A great story to read and listen to! It is read with professional intonation. It captures a child’s attention.

      "label": "The apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n+   No ADS! The purchase of this app is to remove all ads.\n+   Audio: TTS (Text-To-Speech). Have the books read aloud to you or listen to it as you read along.\n+   All OFFLINE! There is no need for an internet connection.\n+   Auto-scrolling in a single page permits continuous reading through the entire book without having to flip a page or touching the screen.\n+   Full-Screen mode is available.\n+   Bookmarks can be placed at any place in multiple books.\n+   Notepad: one click on any verse number to copy and paste that verse into the notepad.\n+   Notes can be saved and transferred.\n+   Highlight: 4 different shades and 3 different levels of intensity to choose from.\n+   Big Fonts and Bold Fonts are available!

Others believe it is valid and that it should never have been removed- that it was considered part of the Bible for nearly 2,000 years before it was recently removed a little more than 100 years ago. Some say it was removed because of not finding the books in the original Hebrew manuscripts. Others claim it wasn't removed by the church, but by printers to cut costs in distributing Bibles in the United States. Both sides tend to cite the same verses that warn against adding or subtracting from the Bible: Revelation 22:18. The word 'apocrypha' means 'hidden.' Fragments of Dead Sea Scrolls dating back to before 70 A.D. contained parts of the apocrypha books in Hebrew, including Sirach and Tobit.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download within the app for free.\n\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThe World English Bible (WEB) is a complete translation of the Holy Bible in normal modern English.\n\nThank you for using Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books PRO."

      "label": "Jesus Calling is your yearlong guide to living a more peaceful life. The Jesus Calling App is the mobile version of the time-tested classic packed with digital features that make this daily devotional more accessible than ever:\n\n  * Full devotional text and fully written-out Scriptures\n  * Search by keyword, date, topic, and verse\n  * Share devotional excerpts and inspirational quotes on social media\n  * Functions as a prayer journal app – keep notes for each devotion\n  * Shop for other Sarah Young devotions inside the app\n  * Easy access to the Jesus Calling community – free podcasts, blogs, and more\n\nExperience a deeper relationship with Jesus as you savor the presence of the One who understands you perfectly and loves you forever. With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

Now it isn't, and that in itself would almost justify the price of the iPad that made it possible.”\n-The Guardian, UK, John Naughton\n\n------------\n\nThe Waste Land is published jointly by Faber and Faber and RGB. Faber is the London publisher where Eliot himself worked for almost four decades; RGB is behind other revolutionary interactive books for iPad including The Elements and Solar System which are defining the future of publishing. The interviews and Fiona Shaw's performance are specially filmed by Adam Low, director of the BBC Arena documentary on Eliot.\n\nPublication of The Waste Land in 1922 was a milestone in the literary history of the 20th Century. This edition carries forward Eliot's vision and vividly demonstrates how literature can be illuminated by the new digital medium."

First published in 1890 with the help of more than one hundred colleagues, Strong's remains the most widely used concordance and dictionary of Bible words from the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nThis updated edition of Strong's Exhaustive Concordance takes James Strong's monumental work and updates it to be even more useful to the modern reader. It maintains all of the features that have made Strong's indispensable for over 100 years: \n- Allows the reader to easily find all biblical occurrences of a word in the King James Version\n- Points the reader to the underlying Hebrew and Greek words\n- Uses the Strong's numbering system which is used in many of the new study tools of today \n\nAnd adds new features that make it even more useful: \n- Corrected, updated, and expanded using the latest computing search tools\n- Extra-clear font and page design make this edition readable and easy to navigate\n- Updated and improved Hebrew and Greek dictionaries tie each word to the Greek or Hebrew root\n- Discover the Hebrew and Greek words underlying the KJV English using the Strong's numbering system\n- Use the updated Hebrew and Greek dictionaries to find brief definitions of each word of the original languages\n\nGo beyond mere searches for lost verses and hone your skills by utilizing this tool's more advanced features.\n\nFind every occurrence of any word in the King James Version Bible. Only the words not likely to be used in locating a passage have been eliminated (words such as should, those, and when) or condensed to include only the important occurrences (words such as bring, day, and might). \n\nStudents of the Bible utilize the wealth of resources offered in Strong's ranging from doing word and thematic studies to probing the deeper meanings embedded in the original languages of the Bible."

      "label": "THE MIRROR is a translation by Francois du Toit from the original text of the New Testament and paraphrased in contemporary speech with in depth commentary.\n\nEndorsed, loved and read by church leaders and laymen globally: Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dr C Baxter Kruger, Dr Steve McVey, Bob and Judith Mumford, etc.\n \nThe Mirror will open your eyes to what Scripture has always been about: Christ, the Son of God, did not come to be an example for you, but of you! The incarnation (the eternal Word becoming man) is the most accurate and articulate translation. Jesus came to reveal you!\n\nAny sincere student of classical music would sensitively seek to capture and interpret the piece, so as not to distract from the original sound of the composition.\n\nTo form a conclusion in the study of our origin would involve a peering over the Creator’s shoulder as it were, in order to gaze through his eyes and marvel at his anticipation. His invisible image and likeness is about to be unveiled in human form!\n\nThe incarnation celebrates the fact that the destiny of the Word was not the page but tangible human life! The word of truth preserves God’s original idea in the resonance of our hearts.\n\n2 Corinthians 3:2: Instead of an impressive certificate framed on my wall I have you framed in my heart! You are our Epistle written within us, an open letter speaking a global language; one that everyone can read[1] and recognize as their mother tongue! (The word [1]anaginosko, from ana, upward and ginosko, to know upward; thus to draw knowledge from a higher reference; from above; to recognize; to read with recognition.)\n\n2 Corinthians 3:3: The fact that you are a Christ-Epistle shines as bright as day! This is what our ministry is all about. The Spirit of God is the living ink. Every trace of the Spirit’s influence on the heart is what gives permanence to this conversation. We are not talking law-language here; this is more dynamic and permanent than letters chiseled in stone. This conversation is embroidered in your inner consciousness. (It is the life of your design that grace echoes within you!)\n\nBehold how beautiful\nhow valuable\nhow loved\nyou are!\n\nYou will rediscover your identity in the very image of the invisible God.\n\nhttps://www.mirrorword.net \nSubscribe to Francois facebook updates http://www.facebook.com/francois.toit\nThe Mirror Translation fb group http://www.facebook.com/groups/179109018883718 \n\n---\n\nAbout Content Rights:\n\nCopyright © 2012 by Francois du Toit.

Beautifully done!\" 5/5 Reading Buddies\n\nBoard the \"Bedtime Express\" for the perfect animated bedtime story. Meet the unusual passengers on their way home at the end of the day and visit them in their homes to say goodnight. \n\nEach night, the train stops at different locations and picks up different passengers. One night you could be making Badger a hot chocolate and playing \"I-Spy\" with the fox family. The next night, you could be helping the Mouse family find their lost tickets and waking a sleeping Polar Bear!\n\nOnce you have stamped all the passengers' tickets, the train pulls into the last station and you are taken to each of the passengers' homes to put them to bed. To send them off to sleep, you'll need to do things like switching off lights, closing curtains or lighting a log fire.\n\nChildren will love meeting the adorable characters and helping them on their journey. \n\nThere are 6 different groups of passengers, from meerkats to polar bears, and 5 different locations to visit, from the city to the arctic. \n\nThe story is packed with highly detailed illustration and animation and the gentle pace of the story provides a calm atmosphere at bedtime. \n\nClimb aboard the Bedtime Express and discover who has boarded the train tonight!\n\nwww.unit11apps.com | facebook.com/unit11apps"

Есть несколько смысловых рядов, которые раскрываются при вникании в сказку. Важно и воспитательное значение сказок для детей. Как писал сам Афанасьев: \"Дети слушают их охотнее всех нравственных рассказов и повестей\".  \nКроме того, присутствуют страшные сказки, народные анекдоты, прибаутки и докучные сказки.\nВ приложении удобное управление и меню. Есть возможность выбрать фон: белый, черный и желтый, изменить размер шрифта, вид шрифта, а также перелистывать сказки. Можно включить вывод полосы с названием сказки вверху. Кроме того, запоминается последнее место чтения при закрытии приложения. Можно открыть приложение и продолжить чтение.\nВсе Ваши пожелания будут приняты во внимание.\nНе забудьте посмотреть другие мои приложения.\nЕсли у Вас возникли трудности с приобретением приложения, то обращайтесь по e-mail: glad-ghost@mail.ru\nПриятного пользования!"

Double tap on a panel and watch the app automatically detect its boundaries and zoom in on it.\n    3. Tap on the side of the screen to easily move to the next panel. If needed, the app will rotate the comic to make maximum use of your screen space.\n\nKey Features\n============\nSmart Reader:\n    - Automatically zoom in and move between panels for a smooth reading experience.\n    - Works with any comic, western or manga, no matter the art style. Panels do not need well-defined edges to be detected.\n    - Always stay in control, let the app guide you over the page while you can always manually zoom and pan.\n\nComic Collection:\n    - Import comics from anywhere and organize your comic collection.\n    - Comics are stored in iCloud to save storage space and keep your collection in sync across devices.\n    - Your Smart Comic Reader collection is a regular folder on your iCloud Drive that you can access and manage from any iCloud connected device, like a Mac, or a Windows device using iCloud for Windows.\n    - Also works locally if iCloud is disabled.\n    - Supports comics in CBZ/ZIP, CBR/RAR and PDF formats.\n\nAnd many more features to come!\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to send them to: support@vandijk.dev.\n\n\n\nComics in video and screenshots:\n“Pepper&Carrot”, David Revoy, CC-By\n“Plastic Man”, Quality Comics, Public Domain\n“Say Hello to Black Jack”, Shuho Sato"

Many people who are looking to work on their personal growth or increase their peace and joy also find this app inspirational and helpful.\r\n\r\nThe app contains all 366 motivational readings from Beattie’s best-selling book, one for each day of the year.

Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on the reading.\r\n\r\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: facing fears, getting to know yourself, dealing with grief, finding hope, recognizing manipulation, learning to have fun, and letting go of the things that are holding you back. Some readings feature activities to extend the experience.\r\n\r\nHandy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon are also included in the app.\r\n\r\nBy integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for themselves and their self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\r\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\r\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\r\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\r\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\r\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\r\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\r\nSET your font size using your device settings.\r\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

A total of 732 readings (2 for each day of the year) are included. No subscriptions or in-app purchases are required.\n\nEach reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a simple prayer or affirmation. Topics include: self-esteem, relationships, independence, fear, health, making mistakes, gratitude, and many others. Author Amy E. Dean gently reminds us of all the tools we have access to: the Twelve Steps, sponsors, slogans, our Higher Power, prayer, and meditation. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions of AA.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus on your sobriety.\n\nAbout the Author\nAmy E. Dean is the best-selling author of several meditation books, and is an in-demand speaker on recovery topics and self-esteem.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSWITCH between morning and night meditations, favorites, and search results using the sun/moon icon.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite meditations (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH for relevant keywords in both morning and night meditations.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read today’s messages.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

      "label": "This app presents the lives of the saints of the Ethiopian church. The lives are arranged according to the Ethiopian calendar with the corresponding western Gregorian dates given in the titles.\n\n\nIn Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Synaxarium is the classic, abridged, collection of the “Lives of the Saints,” intended for reading in the context of public worship, and to nourish the personal prayer life of the faithful. As the Church continues its journey toward its fulfillment in the Kingdom of heaven, it does not cease to grow through the addition of new saints in every generation. Thus the Synaxarium is a work which continues to be written, no so much with ink, but with the blood of the martyrs, the tears of the ascetics, and the wondrous deeds of those who love God, in every place where the word of the Gospel has resounded forth.\n\n\nThe world is sanctified, saved and redeemed through the presence of the saints that are in it like the leaven in the loaf, preparing mankind for the final revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ. \n\nThe saints who shine with the divine light have become gods by the grace of the Holy Spirit, to the extent that baptized into Christ they have put on Christ. To the extent that they have taken up their cross with Christ, so as to crucify in themselves the old man, full of passions, sins and all uncleanness, they have been able to share also in the glory of Christ's Resurrection. By partaking in Christ's Passion through martyrdom, ascesis, tears and practice of all the evangelic virtues, the saints have overcome death with Him. They are henceforth alive to God, for Christ has made his abode with them.\n\n\nWe have three ways of bringing the saints daily into our spiritual lives: by chanting the hymns and church services dedicated to them, by venerating their icons and by reading their lives in the Synaxarion. Christians who live in the world may not be able to go to church every day to chant the praises of the saints but, whether alone or in the family, everyone can chant the troparion of the saint of the day, everyone can venerate the icon, everyone can devote a few minutes to reading or reading again the life of the saint in the Synaxarion. But the daily reading of these short accounts will not profit us unless we come to it in the spirit of venerating an icon. For what we read in the Synaxarion, imperfect though it be, makes the saint present to us no less than the figure in the holy icon and is equally grace-bearing. It all depends on our simplicity of heart. And so, wherever we find ourselves, whatever our spiritual level, whatever our desire to dedicate our life to God, we will find new strength in the Synaxarion and a foretaste of everlasting life, where all the saints with the angels around the throne of God will praise his Name.\n\nFeatures of the App\r\n\r\nTheme\r\n• Material Design color schemes.\r\n• Setting for Night mode and Day Mode\r\n\r\nMultiple book collections\r\n• Add two or more translations to the app.\r\n• Multiple books of Ethiopian prayers\r\n\r\n\n\r\nFonts and Font Sizes\r\n• You can change fonts sizes from toolbar or navigation menu.\r\n• The app uses true type fonts for main view. \r\n\r\n\nContents\r\n• Book contents are rearranged and missing parts included\r\n• Colorful texts for the name of God, Jesus, St. Mary and Saints\r\n• Notices and Orders in the book are written in italic for emphasis\r\n\r\nInterface translations\r\n• Added interface translations in English, Amharic and Afaan Oromoo.\r\n• Changing the app Interface language will change menu item’s name.\r\n\r\nSearch\r\n• Powerful and fast search features\r\n• Search the whole words and accents\r\n• Number of search results displayed at the bottom of the page\r\n\r\nSettings screen\r\n• Allow the user of the app to configure the following settings:\r\n• Book selection type: list or grid\r\n• Red Letters: show the name of saints in red"

      "label": "\"Paganism\" refers to a range of spiritual paths. These are generally Neopagan religions based on the deities, symbols, practices, seasonal days of celebration and other surviving components of ancient religions, which had been long suppressed.\n\nPaganism refers to the authentic religions of ancient Greece and Rome as well as surrounding areas. It originated from the Neolithic (Stone Age) era. The term, pagan, is derived from the Latin word, paganus, which means a country dweller. The pagan usually has a belief in many gods (polytheistic), but only one is chosen as the one to worship which represents the chief god and supreme godhead. \n\nMany Pagan deities are associated with various aspects of the human experience, such as love, death, marriage, fertility, healing, war, and so forth. Still others are connected to different phases of the agricultural cycle, the moon, and the sun.

Our interactive book app version of my book manages to both retain the original board book experience, and add subtle and captivating dimension to it. It’s such wonderful fun. And oh! I am so smitten by Billy J. Kramer’s infinitely reassuring narration for this, and Michael Ford’s understated and lovely piano composition.” - Sandra Boynton \n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, The Going to Bed Book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and thoroughly mesmerizing and delightful discovery.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Imagine! An ark that rocks.\n\n* Touch, pull, and turn animals and objects to make them move, or tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade \n\n* Tap water that turns on and off, and steam that fogs the screen. Can you write your name in the steam? Of course!\n\n* There are teeth to brush, and a group exercise session with ten pajama-clad animals (big and small) each with its own unique exercise.\n\n* Help the little piggy turn off the lights, then rock yourself to sleep to the music box sound of beautiful twinkling stars.\n\n* There's something wonderful to discover on every page.\n\n* \"The Big Guy Reads It\" narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills \n\n* Or “I want to read it myself” and hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\n* Wonderful resonant and gentle narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer \n\n* Boynton’s original text and illustrations for her popular The Going to Bed Book (over 5 million in print!) \n\nBoynton adds, “Of course The Going to Bed Book app is first and foremost for children, and I know they will be captivated and delighted. But it’s also perfect for agitated high-level executives. What a great evening-time alternative to reviewing the minutes of last week’s Near-Term Strategic Wombat Acquisitions meeting.” \n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

Thanks Wanderful!”\n\n- Marc Brown, Author of the Arthur series of books\n\n\"Arthur's Birthday is an interactive storybook, adapted from the original Living Books software series. It is priced at $4.99 and is one of the best ways you can spend 5 bucks for your child.\n\nThe app includes the original story, which you can have read to you, or which you can explore via extensive interactivity. Nearly every object on every page is interactive in some way, and each reacts to touch in a thoughtfully-designed manner. These elements come alive, interact with other on-screen elements, and interact with the story itself in a logical and appropriate way.\n\nWords are interactive, too. Readers can touch any word to hear what it sounds like. Aside from the obvious reading and word learning that can occur, we also had fun pressing different words to create completely different sentences than those actually written on the screen. And then laugh hysterically at the fun we were having.\n\nAlso included are both English and Spanish versions, parental tips, and rich teacher resources for use in the classroom setting. This is another world-class interactive storybook from Wanderful.\"\n\n- Tim Leverett   ©2013 Parents' Choice \n\nArthur’s Birthday is an enchanting interactive reading experience with fully animated content featuring Arthur, star of the longest running children’s animated show in history. Wanderful brings every page of this heart-warming Marc Brown story to life. Arthur and Muffy are each planning their birthday parties for next Saturday afternoon. How will their friends decide which to attend?\n\nRead and play inside each of the fully animated pages, where everything comes to life for hours of delightful story fun as Arthur creates a solution that includes everyone. In English and Spanish with French story content available as an in-app upgrade.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n• Story is in both English and Spanish - change language from any page\n• Unlock French story content with in-app upgrade\n• Each page is fully animated and interactive and virtually every item comes to life when tapped\n• All words are recorded twice and are fully “active” for extended word play and language learning\n• A hidden surprise is on each page – see if you can find all the confetti\n• Move between pages with swipe or with scrolling page navigation\n• Two story modes: “Read to Me” and the fully interactive “Let Me Play”\n• Multiple settings further customize the App for your child’s reading experience\n• Parental tips help you get the most out of this Wanderful interactive storybook\n• Teacher resources include a 36 page overview of Wanderful interactive storybooks Classroom Activities and a free preview of the Arthur’s Birthday Classroom Activities guide\n• The full 61 page Arthur’s Birthday Classroom Activities guide is available as an in-app upgrade\n\nArthur’s Birthday is written by Marc Brown. Over 65 Million Arthur books are in print and the Arthur TV show is the longest running children’s animated show in history.\n\nPrivacy Disclosure\nWanderful creates engaging interactive storybooks for children that are educational, fun, and above all safe and appropriate.

      "label": "Jesus Calling is your yearlong guide to living a more peaceful life. The Jesus Calling App is the mobile version of the time-tested classic packed with digital features that make this daily devotional more accessible than ever:\n\n  * Full devotional text and fully written-out Scriptures\n  * Search by keyword, date, topic, and verse\n  * Share devotional excerpts and inspirational quotes on social media\n  * Functions as a prayer journal app – keep notes for each devotion\n  * Shop for other Sarah Young devotions inside the app\n  * Easy access to the Jesus Calling community – free podcasts, blogs, and more\n\nExperience a deeper relationship with Jesus as you savor the presence of the One who understands you perfectly and loves you forever. With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

      "label": "The Waste Land brings alive the most revolutionary poem of the last hundred years for a 21st Century audience. A wealth of interactive features illuminate T. S. Eliot's greatest work.\n\nThis digital edition carefully respects the typography and integrity of the original yet offers spectacular new ways to explore the significance and influence of the poem.\n\n• watch a remarkable specially filmed performance of the entire poem by Fiona Shaw, synchronised to the text\n• listen to complete audio readings of the poem, also synchronised to the text, by T. S. Eliot himself (readings from two periods in his life) as well as Ted Hughes, Alec Guinness, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons with Eileen Atkins\n• understand the poem’s many references and allusions with the help of comprehensive interactive notes\n• reveal the structure of the verse and move quickly between sections with a new navigation tool\n• watch over 35 expert video perspectives on the poem including contributions from Seamus Heaney and Jeanette Winterson \n• examine original manuscript pages to see how the poem took shape under Ezra Pound’s editing\n\n------------\n\nWinner Best Adult App at the FutureBook Awards 2011\nWinner International Interaction Design Award 2013\n\n------------\n\n“As someone coming from the wrong side of the two cultures, Eliot's poem had effectively been closed off to me for decades. Now it isn't, and that in itself would almost justify the price of the iPad that made it possible.”\n-The Guardian, UK, John Naughton\n\n------------\n\nThe Waste Land is published jointly by Faber and Faber and RGB. Faber is the London publisher where Eliot himself worked for almost four decades; RGB is behind other revolutionary interactive books for iPad including The Elements and Solar System which are defining the future of publishing. The interviews and Fiona Shaw's performance are specially filmed by Adam Low, director of the BBC Arena documentary on Eliot.\n\nPublication of The Waste Land in 1922 was a milestone in the literary history of the 20th Century. This edition carries forward Eliot's vision and vividly demonstrates how literature can be illuminated by the new digital medium."

You can browse by title, author or genre, look at new recordings, or search by keyword.  Because the books are free, you can listen to as much or as little of a book as you like with no cost.  The app remembers your position, so when you return to a book later, you can start listening at the place where you left off.  Unlimited bookmarks and a sleep timer are included for your convenience.\n\nTo see the LibriVox catalog on the web, visit https://librivox.app"

Many people who are looking to work on their personal growth or increase their peace and joy also find this app inspirational and helpful.\r\n\r\nThe app contains all 366 motivational readings from Beattie’s best-selling book, one for each day of the year. It is a companion to “The Language of Letting Go” and can be used by itself or in conjunction with that title. When the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on the reading.\r\n\r\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: facing fears, getting to know yourself, dealing with grief, finding hope, recognizing manipulation, learning to have fun, and letting go of the things that are holding you back. Some readings feature activities to extend the experience.\r\n\r\nHandy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon are also included in the app.\r\n\r\nBy integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for themselves and their self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\r\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\r\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\r\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\r\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\r\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\r\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\r\nSET your font size using your device settings.\r\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

It maintains all of the features that have made Strong's indispensable for over 100 years: \n- Allows the reader to easily find all biblical occurrences of a word in the King James Version\n- Points the reader to the underlying Hebrew and Greek words\n- Uses the Strong's numbering system which is used in many of the new study tools of today \n\nAnd adds new features that make it even more useful: \n- Corrected, updated, and expanded using the latest computing search tools\n- Extra-clear font and page design make this edition readable and easy to navigate\n- Updated and improved Hebrew and Greek dictionaries tie each word to the Greek or Hebrew root\n- Discover the Hebrew and Greek words underlying the KJV English using the Strong's numbering system\n- Use the updated Hebrew and Greek dictionaries to find brief definitions of each word of the original languages\n\nGo beyond mere searches for lost verses and hone your skills by utilizing this tool's more advanced features.\n\nFind every occurrence of any word in the King James Version Bible. Only the words not likely to be used in locating a passage have been eliminated (words such as should, those, and when) or condensed to include only the important occurrences (words such as bring, day, and might). \n\nStudents of the Bible utilize the wealth of resources offered in Strong's ranging from doing word and thematic studies to probing the deeper meanings embedded in the original languages of the Bible."

      "label": "Based on Joyce Meyer's New York Times bestseller Power Thoughts, this devotional includes 365 opportunities to tap into God's power in your daily life by thinking and speaking His way. The POWER THOUGHTS DEVOTIONAL will provide you with life-changing declarations of truth, directly from God's Word, to think and speak over your life every day of the year.\n\nThis daily app has a devotion search feature, customized daily push notifications, and the ability to combine your favorite passages with images into beautiful shareable 'Quotos'! \n\nProverbs 18:21 says, \"Death and life are in the power of the tongue.\" Simply put, words are containers for power--positive or negative, creative or destructive. Therefore, it is imperative that you learn to think and speak on purpose, using the life-giving wisdom in God's Word. When you do, your life will never be the same!\n\nIf you struggle with being negative, critical, or judgmental of people and situations, don't be discouraged. God wants to help you renew your mind to think and speak as He would. It won't happen overnight--but each day you will make progress as you choose power thoughts to be more like Jesus.\n\nIt's time for you to experience and enjoy the life God created you to live, and Joyce wants to help you get there. You can do it with this devotional by learning how to think and speak power thoughts daily."

Thanks Wanderful!”\n\n- Marc Brown, Author of the Arthur series of books\n\n\"Arthur's Birthday is an interactive storybook, adapted from the original Living Books software series. It is priced at $4.99 and is one of the best ways you can spend 5 bucks for your child.\n\nThe app includes the original story, which you can have read to you, or which you can explore via extensive interactivity. Nearly every object on every page is interactive in some way, and each reacts to touch in a thoughtfully-designed manner. These elements come alive, interact with other on-screen elements, and interact with the story itself in a logical and appropriate way.\n\nWords are interactive, too. Readers can touch any word to hear what it sounds like. Aside from the obvious reading and word learning that can occur, we also had fun pressing different words to create completely different sentences than those actually written on the screen. And then laugh hysterically at the fun we were having.\n\nAlso included are both English and Spanish versions, parental tips, and rich teacher resources for use in the classroom setting. This is another world-class interactive storybook from Wanderful.\"\n\n- Tim Leverett   ©2013 Parents' Choice \n\nArthur’s Birthday is an enchanting interactive reading experience with fully animated content featuring Arthur, star of the longest running children’s animated show in history. Wanderful brings every page of this heart-warming Marc Brown story to life. Arthur and Muffy are each planning their birthday parties for next Saturday afternoon. How will their friends decide which to attend?\n\nRead and play inside each of the fully animated pages, where everything comes to life for hours of delightful story fun as Arthur creates a solution that includes everyone. In English and Spanish with French story content available as an in-app upgrade.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n• Story is in both English and Spanish - change language from any page\n• Unlock French story content with in-app upgrade\n• Each page is fully animated and interactive and virtually every item comes to life when tapped\n• All words are recorded twice and are fully “active” for extended word play and language learning\n• A hidden surprise is on each page – see if you can find all the confetti\n• Move between pages with swipe or with scrolling page navigation\n• Two story modes: “Read to Me” and the fully interactive “Let Me Play”\n• Multiple settings further customize the App for your child’s reading experience\n• Parental tips help you get the most out of this Wanderful interactive storybook\n• Teacher resources include a 36 page overview of Wanderful interactive storybooks Classroom Activities and a free preview of the Arthur’s Birthday Classroom Activities guide\n• The full 61 page Arthur’s Birthday Classroom Activities guide is available as an in-app upgrade\n\nArthur’s Birthday is written by Marc Brown. Over 65 Million Arthur books are in print and the Arthur TV show is the longest running children’s animated show in history.\n\nPrivacy Disclosure\nWanderful creates engaging interactive storybooks for children that are educational, fun, and above all safe and appropriate.

Enoch contains unique material on the origins of demons and Nephilim, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why the Genesis flood was morally necessary, and prophetic exposition of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah.\n\nThe Book of Jubilees claims to present \"the history of the division of the days of the Law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the jubilees of the world\" as revealed to Moses (in addition to the Torah or \"Instruction\") by angels while he was on Mount Sinai for forty days and forty nights. The chronology given in Jubilees is based on multiples of seven; the jubilees are periods of 49 years (seven \"year-weeks\"), into which all of time has been divided.\n\nThe Book of Jasher, which means the Book of the Upright or the Book of the Just Man, is a book mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, often interpreted as a lost non-canonical book.\n\nThe Apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nApocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books includes these books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and Laodiceans.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV 1611) are included.\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThank you for using the Books of Jubilees, Jasher, Enoch PRO app."

      "label": "THE MIRROR is a translation by Francois du Toit from the original text of the New Testament and paraphrased in contemporary speech with in depth commentary.\n\nEndorsed, loved and read by church leaders and laymen globally: Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dr C Baxter Kruger, Dr Steve McVey, Bob and Judith Mumford, etc.\n \nThe Mirror will open your eyes to what Scripture has always been about: Christ, the Son of God, did not come to be an example for you, but of you! The incarnation (the eternal Word becoming man) is the most accurate and articulate translation. Jesus came to reveal you!\n\nAny sincere student of classical music would sensitively seek to capture and interpret the piece, so as not to distract from the original sound of the composition.\n\nTo form a conclusion in the study of our origin would involve a peering over the Creator’s shoulder as it were, in order to gaze through his eyes and marvel at his anticipation. His invisible image and likeness is about to be unveiled in human form!\n\nThe incarnation celebrates the fact that the destiny of the Word was not the page but tangible human life! The word of truth preserves God’s original idea in the resonance of our hearts.\n\n2 Corinthians 3:2: Instead of an impressive certificate framed on my wall I have you framed in my heart! You are our Epistle written within us, an open letter speaking a global language; one that everyone can read[1] and recognize as their mother tongue! (The word [1]anaginosko, from ana, upward and ginosko, to know upward; thus to draw knowledge from a higher reference; from above; to recognize; to read with recognition.)\n\n2 Corinthians 3:3: The fact that you are a Christ-Epistle shines as bright as day! This is what our ministry is all about. The Spirit of God is the living ink. Every trace of the Spirit’s influence on the heart is what gives permanence to this conversation. We are not talking law-language here; this is more dynamic and permanent than letters chiseled in stone. This conversation is embroidered in your inner consciousness. (It is the life of your design that grace echoes within you!)\n\nBehold how beautiful\nhow valuable\nhow loved\nyou are!\n\nYou will rediscover your identity in the very image of the invisible God.\n\nhttps://www.mirrorword.net \nSubscribe to Francois facebook updates http://www.facebook.com/francois.toit\nThe Mirror Translation fb group http://www.facebook.com/groups/179109018883718 \n\n---\n\nAbout Content Rights:\n\nCopyright © 2012 by Francois du Toit.

      "label": "The apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n+   No ADS! The purchase of this app is to remove all ads.\n+   Audio: TTS (Text-To-Speech). Have the books read aloud to you or listen to it as you read along.\n+   All OFFLINE! There is no need for an internet connection.\n+   Auto-scrolling in a single page permits continuous reading through the entire book without having to flip a page or touching the screen.\n+   Full-Screen mode is available.\n+   Bookmarks can be placed at any place in multiple books.\n+   Notepad: one click on any verse number to copy and paste that verse into the notepad.\n+   Notes can be saved and transferred.\n+   Highlight: 4 different shades and 3 different levels of intensity to choose from.\n+   Big Fonts and Bold Fonts are available! Easy to see huge fonts.\n+   Searchable keywords within each book.\n+   Feel free to adjust the font size, word spacing, line height, background color, and page margins for optimal reading.\n+   3 verse layout modes.\n+   Resume button that allows you to resume where you last left off.\n+   Landscape or portrait orientation available.\n+   Free Bible, The King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download.\n+   Many more features!\n\nApocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books includes these books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and Laodiceans.\n\nMany claim the apocrypha should never have been included in the first place, raising doubt about its validity and believing it was not God-inspired (for instance, a reference about magic seems inconsistent with the rest of the Bible: Tobit chapter 6, verses 5-8). Others believe it is valid and that it should never have been removed- that it was considered part of the Bible for nearly 2,000 years before it was recently removed a little more than 100 years ago. Some say it was removed because of not finding the books in the original Hebrew manuscripts. Others claim it wasn't removed by the church, but by printers to cut costs in distributing Bibles in the United States. Both sides tend to cite the same verses that warn against adding or subtracting from the Bible: Revelation 22:18. The word 'apocrypha' means 'hidden.' Fragments of Dead Sea Scrolls dating back to before 70 A.D. contained parts of the apocrypha books in Hebrew, including Sirach and Tobit.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download within the app for free.\n\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThe World English Bible (WEB) is a complete translation of the Holy Bible in normal modern English.\n\nThank you for using Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books PRO."

Purity is the force. Utility is the principle. Books are the basis.\n\nFollowing inspiration from so many wonderful Sannyasis and senior devotees, and with permission from the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Dancing Ganesh is privileged to able to present an exclusive program which gives you access to 13 of Srila Prabhupada's books at your fingertips. Just imagine, wherever you travel, in your lunch breaks, giving class, being asked a challenging question, you could have the answers with you in your pocket, beadbag or handbag.\n\nThis is our way of serving Srila Prabhupada's mission of spreading Krishna Consciousness throughout the world. Therefore, the cost of the package containing 13 books has been kept to a minimum. A small amount to pay in return for the most incredible teachings from Srila Prabhupada.\n\nDancing Ganesh has had enormous pleasure in creating this software and owes full gratitude to the continued support of ISKCON devotees.\n\nCOPYRIGHT NOTICE FOR THE INCLUDED BOOKS\n\nThis is an evaluation copy of the printed version of this book, and is NOT FOR RESALE.

Since ancient times these plants have been used for magick.\n\n Through the medicinal properties of plants are fairly known- many or the most widely prescribed drugs are synthesized versions of substances originally derived from plants- their occult powers are less accessible. Much of their magick still lies in of shadow of secrecy.\n\n Our ancestors knew that plants had mysterious, magickal powers. Although the magick in herbs has been forgotten by many, it never disappeared.\n\n If you are working on a oil, or a herbal bag, and want the herb for its scent, then work out a herb that smells similar and use that.  The lists of the magickal properties for the herbs give a few options, you can use one, two, or all of those herbs if you wish to. \n\n When you pick plants, you should always thank their spirit.  Basically you are saying that you thank them for their service to you.  You should only take as much of the plant as you need, and you should never pick small plants, remember to leave enough of the plant so that it can regenerate itself  Some people like to leave an offering at the base of the tree/plant, something like a crystal or perhaps some organic matter to feed the plant.\n\n The application contains information about more than 200 herbs and their magickal use. No internet connection is required to display the items.\n\n \n Features: Over 200 plants and their magickal properties.\n   Share items with your friends via email, Facebook, Twitter or message.\n   Add items to favorites.\n   Search through the list for a specific item."

Anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things. It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times.Anatomy is inherently tied to developmental biology, embryology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny,[3] as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated, both over immediate and long-term timescales. Anatomy and physiology, which study the structure and function of organisms and their parts respectively, make a natural pair of related disciplines, and are often studied together. Human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied in medicine.[4]\n\nThe discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.\n\nThe history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging."

When most of the image has been painted, stars will burst with enchanting sounds, and reveal an amazingly vivid image. When the page is in color, touch the lake to play a popup game. Shake the device to either finish the painting or to restart painting again.\n\nPage 14\nTouch Jack to get him to sing.

One of the best things about this Bible is the formatting of the text into both paragraph and poetic layouts. Poetic sections, like Psalms or The Song of Solomon, are displayed as breaking lines of poetic verse, whereas sections, like Paul's letters, are displayed in a paragraph format more consistent with the letter/exhortation style of the epistle. This makes reading the KJV verse-by-verse easier than ever.  \n\n\nLoudReader, an advanced iPhone reader application, provides the following important customer benefits: \n\n    * True full screen reading mode\n     \n    * Real time font/font size and color/texture previews allow you to select fonts and colors and see in real time what pages would look like \n    – Support all iPhone's available fonts \n    – Support different font size \n    – Support 70+ font color /background color/texture \n\n    * Continuous reading experience (One tap for page down/up; Left/right swipe to next/previous chapter/story) \n    \n    * Portrait and landscape reading mode \n    \n    * Remembers the last reading location (exact book, chapter and scroll position) \n    \n    * Quick scrolling navigation between chapters/stories to provide an overview of the entire book \n    \n    * Quick reference feature and web browser type functions maintain user's browser history \n    \n    * Displays rich formatted HTML book (NOT plain text) \n    \n    * Quick and easy access to the Reader Instruction/Help \n    \n    \n    LoudReader User Instructions: \n    \n    * Each chapter/story is displayed in a continuous page, use finger to scroll the page down/up to read: \n    - One tap on the top 1/4 of the screen to page up \n    - One tap on the bottom 1/4 of the screen to page down \n    - Swipe Left to the next chapter \n    - Swipe right to the previous chapter \n    \n    * Double tap on the screen to pop up the control panel to access chapter navigation/ font / font size/ font color / background color/background texture \n    – use picker to choose a chapter and tap on the bottom blue arrow  to read \n    - Tap the \"tool/setup\" button for font / font size / font color / background color/background texture \n    - Tap the “?” button for Reader Instruction/Help \n    - Tap the bottom left \"i\" button to access the book content index page \n    \n    * Tap the book icon on the top left of the content index page to access other books in a multi-book application"

      "label": "Mystics have passed down stories of magical realms hidden from mortal sight, bridging the world of Nature and Spirit. Even before the written word, the ancients established a Divine partnership between humans and these Hidden Realms. Both agreed to form an eternal Sacred Alliance to establish harmony and balance between the material and the spiritual. The Alliance ensured that when we asked for guidance in manifesting our reality, they would help us find our way to the highest good for all. But in time, humanity turned itself away from the natural world as a source for the Divine and forgot about the realms in the Unseen realities.\n\nReligious superstition, dominance, and the power of intellect, reason, and technology became our focus; and our partnership was forgotten, so the realms faded away. As our global concerns have increasingly been more plaintive, they have returned to help us find our way home to our true purpose, prosperity, hope, and happiness.\n\nThe cards in this Colette Baron-Reid oracle card app represent some of those realms and their Queens and Kings, Princes, and other magical helpers. Let the Swan Queen point the way to transformation, the Arrow Master help you reach your goals, the Sun Dancers herald your victories, and the Sacred Union speak to the depth of your longing for love. Ask and ye shall receive, for the Highest Good is their motto. If you call upon them, they will answer\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Give readings anywhere, anytime\n- Choose between different types of readings\n- Save your readings to review at any time\n- Email readings to friends\n- Browse the entire deck of cards\n- Flip cards over to read each card's meaning\n- Get the most out of your deck with the guidebook\n- Set a daily reminder for a reading"

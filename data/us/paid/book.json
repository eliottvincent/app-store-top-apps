The Jesus Calling App is the mobile version of the time-tested classic packed with digital features that make this daily devotional more accessible than ever:\n\n  * Full devotional text and fully written-out Scriptures\n  * Search by keyword, date, topic, and verse\n  * Share devotional excerpts and inspirational quotes on social media\n  * Functions as a prayer journal app – keep notes for each devotion\n  * Shop for other Sarah Young devotions inside the app\n  * Easy access to the Jesus Calling community – free podcasts, blogs, and more\n\nExperience a deeper relationship with Jesus as you savor the presence of the One who understands you perfectly and loves you forever. With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

      "label": "Based on Joyce Meyer's New York Times bestseller Power Thoughts, this devotional includes 365 opportunities to tap into God's power in your daily life by thinking and speaking His way. The POWER THOUGHTS DEVOTIONAL will provide you with life-changing declarations of truth, directly from God's Word, to think and speak over your life every day of the year.\n\nThis daily app has a devotion search feature, customized daily push notifications, and the ability to combine your favorite passages with images into beautiful shareable 'Quotos'! \n\nProverbs 18:21 says, \"Death and life are in the power of the tongue.\" Simply put, words are containers for power--positive or negative, creative or destructive. Therefore, it is imperative that you learn to think and speak on purpose, using the life-giving wisdom in God's Word. When you do, your life will never be the same!\n\nIf you struggle with being negative, critical, or judgmental of people and situations, don't be discouraged. God wants to help you renew your mind to think and speak as He would. It won't happen overnight--but each day you will make progress as you choose power thoughts to be more like Jesus.\n\nIt's time for you to experience and enjoy the life God created you to live, and Joyce wants to help you get there. You can do it with this devotional by learning how to think and speak power thoughts daily."

Since ancient times these plants have been used for magick.\n\n Through the medicinal properties of plants are fairly known- many or the most widely prescribed drugs are synthesized versions of substances originally derived from plants- their occult powers are less accessible. Much of their magick still lies in of shadow of secrecy.\n\n Our ancestors knew that plants had mysterious, magickal powers. Although the magick in herbs has been forgotten by many, it never disappeared.\n\n If you are working on a oil, or a herbal bag, and want the herb for its scent, then work out a herb that smells similar and use that.  The lists of the magickal properties for the herbs give a few options, you can use one, two, or all of those herbs if you wish to. \n\n When you pick plants, you should always thank their spirit.  Basically you are saying that you thank them for their service to you.  You should only take as much of the plant as you need, and you should never pick small plants, remember to leave enough of the plant so that it can regenerate itself  Some people like to leave an offering at the base of the tree/plant, something like a crystal or perhaps some organic matter to feed the plant.\n\n The application contains information about more than 200 herbs and their magickal use. No internet connection is required to display the items.\n\n \n Features: Over 200 plants and their magickal properties.\n   Share items with your friends via email, Facebook, Twitter or message.\n   Add items to favorites.\n   Search through the list for a specific item."

First published in 1890 with the help of more than one hundred colleagues, Strong's remains the most widely used concordance and dictionary of Bible words from the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nThis updated edition of Strong's Exhaustive Concordance takes James Strong's monumental work and updates it to be even more useful to the modern reader. It maintains all of the features that have made Strong's indispensable for over 100 years: \n- Allows the reader to easily find all biblical occurrences of a word in the King James Version\n- Points the reader to the underlying Hebrew and Greek words\n- Uses the Strong's numbering system which is used in many of the new study tools of today \n\nAnd adds new features that make it even more useful: \n- Corrected, updated, and expanded using the latest computing search tools\n- Extra-clear font and page design make this edition readable and easy to navigate\n- Updated and improved Hebrew and Greek dictionaries tie each word to the Greek or Hebrew root\n- Discover the Hebrew and Greek words underlying the KJV English using the Strong's numbering system\n- Use the updated Hebrew and Greek dictionaries to find brief definitions of each word of the original languages\n\nGo beyond mere searches for lost verses and hone your skills by utilizing this tool's more advanced features.\n\nFind every occurrence of any word in the King James Version Bible. Only the words not likely to be used in locating a passage have been eliminated (words such as should, those, and when) or condensed to include only the important occurrences (words such as bring, day, and might). \n\nStudents of the Bible utilize the wealth of resources offered in Strong's ranging from doing word and thematic studies to probing the deeper meanings embedded in the original languages of the Bible."

Many people who are looking to work on their personal growth or increase their peace and joy also find this app inspirational and helpful.\r\n\r\nThe app contains all 366 motivational readings from Beattie’s best-selling book, one for each day of the year.

Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on the reading.\r\n\r\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: facing fears, getting to know yourself, dealing with grief, finding hope, recognizing manipulation, learning to have fun, and letting go of the things that are holding you back. Some readings feature activities to extend the experience.\r\n\r\nHandy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon are also included in the app.\r\n\r\nBy integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for themselves and their self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\r\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\r\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\r\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\r\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\r\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\r\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\r\nSET your font size using your device settings.\r\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

If readers suffer from negative thoughts, they can take heart! Joyce Meyer has helped millions win these all-important battles. In her most popular best seller ever, the beloved author and minister shows readers how to change their lives by changing their minds.\n\nShe teaches how to deal with thousands of thoughts that people think every day and how to focus the mind the way God thinks. And she shares the trials, tragedies, and ultimate victories from her own marriage, family, and ministry that led her to wondrous, life-transforming truth — and reveals her thoughts and feelings every step of the way.\n\nThis app is part of, and makes use of, the Folium Stellar™ network.\n\n• PLAYER CONTROLS.  Includes listen (play), pause, multi-speed fast forward/reverse, jump ahead/back, chapter skip, one-touch chapter- and bookmark browser. There is also a “scrub” bar that finds any point inside the chapter with just a tap.\n\n• SLEEP TIMER. Have you ever fallen asleep watching TV or listening to something? If so, you'll love this feature. Once set, the app will stop, place a bookmark, and allow you to jump back to where you probably began dozing.\n\n• CLEAR & ELEGANT DESIGN.  Simple, clean, intuitive, and smarter than average.\n\n• CHAPTER TIMINGS. Always know how much time it will take to finish a chapter.\n\n• OFFLINE LISTENING. You are airplane-ready! Once downloaded, listen uninterrupted without threat from a lost network connection. Downloads are usually just 5-10 minutes, but depend upon your network speed.\n\n• AUTO-BOOKMARKING.  The player remembers where you stopped listening and returns to that exact spot when you open the app again.\n\n• SOCIAL SHARING. An easy way to recommend the app to your friends."

Joyce asks the question, \"Are you listening?\" and shares how to do just that...on a daily basis.\n\nThis daily app has a devotional search feature, customized daily push notifications, and the ability to combine your favorite passages with images into beautiful shareable 'Quotos'!\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJoyce Meyer is one of the world's leading practical Bible teachers. A #1 New York Times bestselling author, she has written many inspirational books, including The Mind Connection, Power Thoughts, The Confident Woman, the entire Battlefield of the Mind family of books, as well as many others.

      "label": "THE MIRROR is a translation by Francois du Toit from the original text of the New Testament and paraphrased in contemporary speech with in depth commentary.\n\nEndorsed, loved and read by church leaders and laymen globally: Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dr C Baxter Kruger, Dr Steve McVey, Bob and Judith Mumford, etc.\n \nThe Mirror will open your eyes to what Scripture has always been about: Christ, the Son of God, did not come to be an example for you, but of you! The incarnation (the eternal Word becoming man) is the most accurate and articulate translation. Jesus came to reveal you!\n\nAny sincere student of classical music would sensitively seek to capture and interpret the piece, so as not to distract from the original sound of the composition.\n\nTo form a conclusion in the study of our origin would involve a peering over the Creator’s shoulder as it were, in order to gaze through his eyes and marvel at his anticipation. His invisible image and likeness is about to be unveiled in human form!\n\nThe incarnation celebrates the fact that the destiny of the Word was not the page but tangible human life! The word of truth preserves God’s original idea in the resonance of our hearts.\n\n2 Corinthians 3:2: Instead of an impressive certificate framed on my wall I have you framed in my heart! You are our Epistle written within us, an open letter speaking a global language; one that everyone can read[1] and recognize as their mother tongue! (The word [1]anaginosko, from ana, upward and ginosko, to know upward; thus to draw knowledge from a higher reference; from above; to recognize; to read with recognition.)\n\n2 Corinthians 3:3: The fact that you are a Christ-Epistle shines as bright as day! This is what our ministry is all about. The Spirit of God is the living ink. Every trace of the Spirit’s influence on the heart is what gives permanence to this conversation. We are not talking law-language here; this is more dynamic and permanent than letters chiseled in stone. This conversation is embroidered in your inner consciousness. (It is the life of your design that grace echoes within you!)\n\nBehold how beautiful\nhow valuable\nhow loved\nyou are!\n\nYou will rediscover your identity in the very image of the invisible God.\n\nhttps://www.mirrorword.net \nSubscribe to Francois facebook updates http://www.facebook.com/francois.toit\nThe Mirror Translation fb group http://www.facebook.com/groups/179109018883718 \n\n---\n\nAbout Content Rights:\n\nCopyright © 2012 by Francois du Toit.

With the Readings for Moms of Addicts app, you can carry these new meaningful readings with you wherever you go.

The app offers Read to Me or Let Me Play modes. The former is especially delightful. Animations play automatically, which encourages children to listen up, watch, and take a break from tapping their screen. The story's words are highlighted as expressive voice actors read them so that early readers can follow along.\n\nThough in a sense a ghost story, Harry and the Haunted House will inspire more giggles than scares. After Harry hits his baseball a little too far, he and his friends decide to look for it in the abandoned house where it lands. Children will enjoy seeing how Harry and his friends' imaginations create spooky situations. They see ghosts that turn out to be their own reflection, for example, and hear strange noises that are actually Harry's dog playing with the found ball. In the end, children learn that scary things (like old houses, dark closets, or the space under a bed) are not so terrible once one learns more about them.\"\n\n- Parents' Choice   ©2013 Parents' Choice \n\nHave you ever wished you could play inside a story and really interact with all the characters and words? Now you can! Harry and the Haunted House is an imaginative, interactive and slightly spooky reading experience with fully animated content loved by children, parents and teachers alike. \n\nWanderful brings every page of this Mark Schlichting story to life. Read and play along with Harry and his friends as they retrieve their baseball lost in the “haunted” house across the field. “W-W-What’s that noise?” “We froze in our steps…”\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n• Story is in both English and Spanish - change language from any page\n• 12 fully animated pages  \n• French story content unlocks with upgrade\n• Virtually every item on each page comes to life when tapped\n• All words are “active” for extended word play and language learning\n• Animated surprises on each page – can you find all the performing bugs?\n• Move between pages with swipe or with scrolling page navigation\n• Multiple settings to customize the App for your child’s reading experience\n• Two modes: “Read to Me” and the fully interactive “Let Me Play”\n• Parental tips to help you get the most out of this Wanderful interactive storybook\n• Teacher resources include a 31 page overview of Wanderful interactive storybooks Classroom Activities and a free preview of the Harry and the Haunted House Classroom Activities guide \n• The full 58 page Classroom Activities guide is available as an upgrade\n\nWanderful’s goal is to bring outstanding interactive storybooks to a new generation of children. We hope Harry and the Haunted House provides your family, children and students with hours of delightful story play. \n\nHarry and the Haunted House is written by Mark Schlichting, creator of the Living Books series.\n\nPrivacy Disclosure\nWanderful creates engaging interactive storybooks for children that are educational, fun, and above all safe and appropriate.

      "label": "The apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n+   No ADS! The purchase of this app is to remove all ads.\n+   Audio: TTS (Text-To-Speech). Have the books read aloud to you or listen to it as you read along.\n+   All OFFLINE! There is no need for an internet connection.\n+   Auto-scrolling in a single page permits continuous reading through the entire book without having to flip a page or touching the screen.\n+   Full-Screen mode is available.\n+   Bookmarks can be placed at any place in multiple books.\n+   Notepad: one click on any verse number to copy and paste that verse into the notepad.\n+   Notes can be saved and transferred.\n+   Highlight: 4 different shades and 3 different levels of intensity to choose from.\n+   Big Fonts and Bold Fonts are available!

Others believe it is valid and that it should never have been removed- that it was considered part of the Bible for nearly 2,000 years before it was recently removed a little more than 100 years ago. Some say it was removed because of not finding the books in the original Hebrew manuscripts. Others claim it wasn't removed by the church, but by printers to cut costs in distributing Bibles in the United States. Both sides tend to cite the same verses that warn against adding or subtracting from the Bible: Revelation 22:18. The word 'apocrypha' means 'hidden.' Fragments of Dead Sea Scrolls dating back to before 70 A.D. contained parts of the apocrypha books in Hebrew, including Sirach and Tobit.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download within the app for free.\n\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThe World English Bible (WEB) is a complete translation of the Holy Bible in normal modern English.\n\nThank you for using Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books PRO."

The DEBATER gives many ways to argue against Christians, Creationists, and Bible thumpers.  It is set up for very quick reference and memorization, yet contains full arguments as well as different ways to argue the same topics.\n \nCurrent Rating =  4.66/5\n\nExamples include \"Lack of Historical Evidence for Jesus,\"  \"America Was NOT Created as a Christian Nation,\" and  \"God Is Too Hidden to Be Real,\" as well as others.  Arm yourself with very powerful and logical arguments against religious zealots. \n\nSKEPTICISM section contains many subjects related to being a skeptic. Learn how to debunk claims scientifically in just a few questions with \"Bogus Claims Debunker.\"  Aliens, ghosts, psychics, and get-rich-quick schemes are deconstructed using logic.  Several articles were generously provided by Skeptic magazine!\n\nHUMANISM section is a positive and uplifting area consisting of humanistic articles, including \"Declaration of Human Rights\" and \"Life Is to Be Lived Now,\" to name a few. It shows that most of us share humanistic interests, whether we realize it or not, and science is our most valuable tool for humanity. \"The Humanist Manifesto\" is among several articles provided by the American Humanist Association."

Gorgeous artwork, read-along text, and a reasonable price tag...What's not to like?\n-CNET Reviews\n\nThe classic \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" gets a terrific iPad makeover.\n-CNET Reviews\n\nI was really impressed with Jack and the Beanstalk Children’s Interactive Storybook. It takes full advantage of the iPad’s size and looks great. The addition of the hidden activities within the story make it a fun app that my son really enjoyed\n-The iPhone Mom\n\nExperience Jack and the Beanstalk like never before in this wonderfully illustrated storybook, featuring over 30 pages of interactivity which your child will enjoy. This timeless tale comes alive with audio narration, read-along text, and interactive games and features. Each page contains a hidden surprise! Come and dive into the pages of Jack and the Beanstalk and join Jack in his adventure to defeat the giant!\n\nSPOILER WARNING - Don't read this next section if you want to discover all the great surprises in this app on your own!\n\nAll 32 pages are interactive, but here are some highlights you won't want to miss.\n\nPage 1\nTilt the application to watch the sun move. Move the sun with your finger below the mountains and observe day turn to night. Touch the house to watch and hear the chimney puff.\n\nPage 6\nTouch the beans to play the memory matching game.\n\nPage 13\nMagically finger-paint the black -and-white page. When most of the image has been painted, stars will burst with enchanting sounds, and reveal an amazingly vivid image. When the page is in color, touch the lake to play a popup game. Shake the device to either finish the painting or to restart painting again.\n\nPage 14\nTouch Jack to get him to sing. It may take a few times...he's shy!\n\nPage 29\nThe Giant is high on the beanstalk. Tilt the device and watch the Giant sway. The Giant will complain when you shake the device - he's afraid of heights."

This App includes 20 free downloads to start you off.

      "label": "Hazelden Publishing’s Morning Light / Night Light app combines two popular meditation books into one app for double the support for people in recovery from addiction.\n\nEach day you will find two inspirational readings: one to start your day on a bright and positive note, and one to help calm and center you at the end of your day. A total of 732 readings (2 for each day of the year) are included. No subscriptions or in-app purchases are required.\n\nEach reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a simple prayer or affirmation. Topics include: self-esteem, relationships, independence, fear, health, making mistakes, gratitude, and many others. Author Amy E. Dean gently reminds us of all the tools we have access to: the Twelve Steps, sponsors, slogans, our Higher Power, prayer, and meditation. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions of AA.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus on your sobriety.\n\nAbout the Author\nAmy E. Dean is the best-selling author of several meditation books, and is an in-demand speaker on recovery topics and self-esteem.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSWITCH between morning and night meditations, favorites, and search results using the sun/moon icon.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite meditations (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH for relevant keywords in both morning and night meditations.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read today’s messages.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

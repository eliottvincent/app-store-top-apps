The Jesus Calling App is the mobile version of the time-tested classic packed with digital features that make this daily devotional more accessible than ever:\n\n  * Full devotional text and fully written-out Scriptures\n  * Search by keyword, date, topic, and verse\n  * Share devotional excerpts and inspirational quotes on social media\n  * Functions as a prayer journal app – keep notes for each devotion\n  * Shop for other Sarah Young devotions inside the app\n  * Easy access to the Jesus Calling community – free podcasts, blogs, and more\n\nExperience a deeper relationship with Jesus as you savor the presence of the One who understands you perfectly and loves you forever. With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

It will look the book information up in real-time and present it to you quickly. BookScanner will find the AR quiz number, ATOS (also ZPD) level, points, word count, interest level, as well as, via a one-time in-app-purchase, the Lexile measure, equivalent Fountas & Pinnell Level (F&P) / Scholastic Guided Reading Level (GRL), Guided Reading Grade Level information, and Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) information.Your scanned books will save to a history list for easy reference later on. Your history can be referenced from within the app, or you can email, print, or share PDF and CSV files of your scanned book list. Once exported, you can reference your list through a spreadsheet, print labels, or store for safekeeping. \n\nThis is a Universal App with custom screens for iPhone and iPad devices to fit the specific screen size - including support for the latest iPhone models. iPad devices also have support for landscape mode and split view. Apple Silicon Macs can also run the iPad app natively on macOS.\n\nFeedback from parents, school teachers, and librarians is that this app is a MUST have!\n\n*AR and Accelerated Reader are registered trademarks of Renaissance Learning.

First published in 1890 with the help of more than one hundred colleagues, Strong's remains the most widely used concordance and dictionary of Bible words from the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nThis updated edition of Strong's Exhaustive Concordance takes James Strong's monumental work and updates it to be even more useful to the modern reader. It maintains all of the features that have made Strong's indispensable for over 100 years: \n- Allows the reader to easily find all biblical occurrences of a word in the King James Version\n- Points the reader to the underlying Hebrew and Greek words\n- Uses the Strong's numbering system which is used in many of the new study tools of today \n\nAnd adds new features that make it even more useful: \n- Corrected, updated, and expanded using the latest computing search tools\n- Extra-clear font and page design make this edition readable and easy to navigate\n- Updated and improved Hebrew and Greek dictionaries tie each word to the Greek or Hebrew root\n- Discover the Hebrew and Greek words underlying the KJV English using the Strong's numbering system\n- Use the updated Hebrew and Greek dictionaries to find brief definitions of each word of the original languages\n\nGo beyond mere searches for lost verses and hone your skills by utilizing this tool's more advanced features.\n\nFind every occurrence of any word in the King James Version Bible. Only the words not likely to be used in locating a passage have been eliminated (words such as should, those, and when) or condensed to include only the important occurrences (words such as bring, day, and might). \n\nStudents of the Bible utilize the wealth of resources offered in Strong's ranging from doing word and thematic studies to probing the deeper meanings embedded in the original languages of the Bible."

      "label": "Based on Joyce Meyer's New York Times bestseller Power Thoughts, this devotional includes 365 opportunities to tap into God's power in your daily life by thinking and speaking His way. The POWER THOUGHTS DEVOTIONAL will provide you with life-changing declarations of truth, directly from God's Word, to think and speak over your life every day of the year.\n\nThis daily app has a devotion search feature, customized daily push notifications, and the ability to combine your favorite passages with images into beautiful shareable 'Quotos'! \n\nProverbs 18:21 says, \"Death and life are in the power of the tongue.\" Simply put, words are containers for power--positive or negative, creative or destructive. Therefore, it is imperative that you learn to think and speak on purpose, using the life-giving wisdom in God's Word. When you do, your life will never be the same!\n\nIf you struggle with being negative, critical, or judgmental of people and situations, don't be discouraged. God wants to help you renew your mind to think and speak as He would. It won't happen overnight--but each day you will make progress as you choose power thoughts to be more like Jesus.\n\nIt's time for you to experience and enjoy the life God created you to live, and Joyce wants to help you get there. You can do it with this devotional by learning how to think and speak power thoughts daily."

      "label": "Written by popular self-help author Melody Beattie, More Language of Letting Go provides daily guidance and wisdom for those who struggle with codependency and want to change or leave a difficult relationship as well as those in recovery from an addiction. Many people who are looking to work on their personal growth or increase their peace and joy also find this app inspirational and helpful.\r\n\r\nThe app contains all 366 motivational readings from Beattie’s best-selling book, one for each day of the year. It is a companion to “The Language of Letting Go” and can be used by itself or in conjunction with that title. When the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on the reading.\r\n\r\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: facing fears, getting to know yourself, dealing with grief, finding hope, recognizing manipulation, learning to have fun, and letting go of the things that are holding you back. Some readings feature activities to extend the experience.\r\n\r\nHandy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon are also included in the app.\r\n\r\nBy integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for themselves and their self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\r\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\r\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\r\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\r\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\r\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\r\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\r\nSET your font size using your device settings.\r\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

      "label": "** iTunes App of the Week ** \n** Parents' Choice Silver Award Winner ** \n** Kirkus Reviews - Kirkus Star ** \n\nBoynton Moo Media teams up with award-winning Loud Crow Interactive, to bring to life her beloved, funny, wildly best-selling bedtime board book, The Going to Bed Book. \n\n“I absolutely adore working with the ridiculously creative and innovative team at Loud Crow, and I am so proud of what we’ve done together with The Going to Bed Book. Our interactive book app version of my book manages to both retain the original board book experience, and add subtle and captivating dimension to it. It’s such wonderful fun. And oh! I am so smitten by Billy J. Kramer’s infinitely reassuring narration for this, and Michael Ford’s understated and lovely piano composition.” - Sandra Boynton \n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, The Going to Bed Book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and thoroughly mesmerizing and delightful discovery.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Imagine! An ark that rocks.\n\n* Touch, pull, and turn animals and objects to make them move, or tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade \n\n* Tap water that turns on and off, and steam that fogs the screen. Can you write your name in the steam? Of course!\n\n* There are teeth to brush, and a group exercise session with ten pajama-clad animals (big and small) each with its own unique exercise.\n\n* Help the little piggy turn off the lights, then rock yourself to sleep to the music box sound of beautiful twinkling stars.\n\n* There's something wonderful to discover on every page.\n\n* \"The Big Guy Reads It\" narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills \n\n* Or “I want to read it myself” and hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\n* Wonderful resonant and gentle narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer \n\n* Boynton’s original text and illustrations for her popular The Going to Bed Book (over 5 million in print!) \n\nBoynton adds, “Of course The Going to Bed Book app is first and foremost for children, and I know they will be captivated and delighted. But it’s also perfect for agitated high-level executives. What a great evening-time alternative to reviewing the minutes of last week’s Near-Term Strategic Wombat Acquisitions meeting.” \n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

      "label": "The Waste Land brings alive the most revolutionary poem of the last hundred years for a 21st Century audience. A wealth of interactive features illuminate T. S. Eliot's greatest work.\n\nThis digital edition carefully respects the typography and integrity of the original yet offers spectacular new ways to explore the significance and influence of the poem.\n\n• watch a remarkable specially filmed performance of the entire poem by Fiona Shaw, synchronised to the text\n• listen to complete audio readings of the poem, also synchronised to the text, by T. S. Eliot himself (readings from two periods in his life) as well as Ted Hughes, Alec Guinness, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons with Eileen Atkins\n• understand the poem’s many references and allusions with the help of comprehensive interactive notes\n• reveal the structure of the verse and move quickly between sections with a new navigation tool\n• watch over 35 expert video perspectives on the poem including contributions from Seamus Heaney and Jeanette Winterson \n• examine original manuscript pages to see how the poem took shape under Ezra Pound’s editing\n\n------------\n\nWinner Best Adult App at the FutureBook Awards 2011\nWinner International Interaction Design Award 2013\n\n------------\n\n“As someone coming from the wrong side of the two cultures, Eliot's poem had effectively been closed off to me for decades. Now it isn't, and that in itself would almost justify the price of the iPad that made it possible.”\n-The Guardian, UK, John Naughton\n\n------------\n\nThe Waste Land is published jointly by Faber and Faber and RGB. Faber is the London publisher where Eliot himself worked for almost four decades; RGB is behind other revolutionary interactive books for iPad including The Elements and Solar System which are defining the future of publishing. The interviews and Fiona Shaw's performance are specially filmed by Adam Low, director of the BBC Arena documentary on Eliot.\n\nPublication of The Waste Land in 1922 was a milestone in the literary history of the 20th Century. This edition carries forward Eliot's vision and vividly demonstrates how literature can be illuminated by the new digital medium."

The incarnation (the eternal Word becoming man) is the most accurate and articulate translation. Jesus came to reveal you!\n\nAny sincere student of classical music would sensitively seek to capture and interpret the piece, so as not to distract from the original sound of the composition.\n\nTo form a conclusion in the study of our origin would involve a peering over the Creator’s shoulder as it were, in order to gaze through his eyes and marvel at his anticipation. His invisible image and likeness is about to be unveiled in human form!\n\nThe incarnation celebrates the fact that the destiny of the Word was not the page but tangible human life! The word of truth preserves God’s original idea in the resonance of our hearts.\n\n2 Corinthians 3:2: Instead of an impressive certificate framed on my wall I have you framed in my heart! You are our Epistle written within us, an open letter speaking a global language; one that everyone can read[1] and recognize as their mother tongue! (The word [1]anaginosko, from ana, upward and ginosko, to know upward; thus to draw knowledge from a higher reference; from above; to recognize; to read with recognition.)\n\n2 Corinthians 3:3: The fact that you are a Christ-Epistle shines as bright as day! This is what our ministry is all about. The Spirit of God is the living ink. Every trace of the Spirit’s influence on the heart is what gives permanence to this conversation. We are not talking law-language here; this is more dynamic and permanent than letters chiseled in stone. This conversation is embroidered in your inner consciousness. (It is the life of your design that grace echoes within you!)\n\nBehold how beautiful\nhow valuable\nhow loved\nyou are!\n\nYou will rediscover your identity in the very image of the invisible God.\n\nhttps://www.mirrorword.net \nSubscribe to Francois facebook updates http://www.facebook.com/francois.toit\nThe Mirror Translation fb group http://www.facebook.com/groups/179109018883718 \n\n---\n\nAbout Content Rights:\n\nCopyright © 2012 by Francois du Toit.

Sandra Boynton’s best-selling book of all time comes alive with sound and movement and gloriously unpredictable interactivity. The wryly inventive Moo, Baa, La La La! digital book app will intrigue and amuse little kids and big people alike, and perhaps even elicit an appreciative snort from the occasional uninvited rhinoceros. \n\n“This is my second digital book project with the perfectly wonderful team at Loud Crow,” says Sandra Boynton, “and I’m really happy with what we’ve created together. As with The Going to Bed Book, our interactive book app version of Moo, Baa, La La La! succeeds in retaining the original board book experience, while adding multi-sensory dimension. It’s such a cool enterprise.” \n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Moo, Baa, La La La! interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery. Of course you can hear each animal make its unique sound. (In some cases, VERY unique.) But there’s more! Help the perplexed chicken stagehand raise the curtain on a stageful of dapper dancing pigs. Turn day to night with the touch of the moon. Slingshot the running cats away from the barking dogs. A touch of the duck activates a quack which brings in another duck. And another. And another. Even the back cover has a curiously articulate spokesman that you really mustn’t miss. \n\nFeatures:  \n\n* The second Boynton Moo Media book app (following their top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app), venturing far beyond what an e-book experience can offer\n * Touch the animals to hear them moo or oink or quack or even, in the case of three incongruous showbiz pigs, harmonize \n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations for her most popular book ever, Moo, Baa, La La La! (over 5 million in print!) \n* Includes an original instrumental soundtrack, \"Country Air\"; a wonderful uptempo pastoral string quartet written by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book \n* \"The Big Guy Reads It\"; with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” and hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

      "label": "Nature has provided a veritable magical pantry in the plants which grow all over our planet. Since ancient times these plants have been used for magick.\n\n Through the medicinal properties of plants are fairly known- many or the most widely prescribed drugs are synthesized versions of substances originally derived from plants- their occult powers are less accessible. Much of their magick still lies in of shadow of secrecy.\n\n Our ancestors knew that plants had mysterious, magickal powers. Although the magick in herbs has been forgotten by many, it never disappeared.\n\n If you are working on a oil, or a herbal bag, and want the herb for its scent, then work out a herb that smells similar and use that.  The lists of the magickal properties for the herbs give a few options, you can use one, two, or all of those herbs if you wish to. \n\n When you pick plants, you should always thank their spirit.  Basically you are saying that you thank them for their service to you.  You should only take as much of the plant as you need, and you should never pick small plants, remember to leave enough of the plant so that it can regenerate itself  Some people like to leave an offering at the base of the tree/plant, something like a crystal or perhaps some organic matter to feed the plant.\n\n The application contains information about more than 200 herbs and their magickal use. No internet connection is required to display the items.\n\n \n Features: Over 200 plants and their magickal properties.\n   Share items with your friends via email, Facebook, Twitter or message.\n   Add items to favorites.\n   Search through the list for a specific item."

      "label": "\"Paganism\" refers to a range of spiritual paths. These are generally Neopagan religions based on the deities, symbols, practices, seasonal days of celebration and other surviving components of ancient religions, which had been long suppressed.\n\nPaganism refers to the authentic religions of ancient Greece and Rome as well as surrounding areas. It originated from the Neolithic (Stone Age) era. The term, pagan, is derived from the Latin word, paganus, which means a country dweller. The pagan usually has a belief in many gods (polytheistic), but only one is chosen as the one to worship which represents the chief god and supreme godhead. \n\nMany Pagan deities are associated with various aspects of the human experience, such as love, death, marriage, fertility, healing, war, and so forth. Still others are connected to different phases of the agricultural cycle, the moon, and the sun. Read more about the different Types of Pagan Deities, so you can figure out which ones you'd like to try working with, depending on your personality and your magical goals.\n\nIf you want to know more about Pagan Gods and Goddesses, here is your chance.

      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

      "label": "The ASHRAE HVAC Duct Sizer application allows you to quickly size one HVAC duct run or a range of duct sizes using the constant friction method. Think of this application as a digital version of the classic Trane Ductulator.\n \nIn the \"Size by Airflow\" mode, you can specify the total airflow in CFM (or L/s), the aspect ratio and one of either the velocity of air or the friction loss per 100 feet (30 meters). The results include both the exact and rounded height and width (or diameter) dimensions and the calculated velocity and friction loss.\n \nIn the \"Size by Dimensions\" mode, you can analyze an existing duct system. There are options to input the existing duct dimensions and one of either the airflow or velocity values to derive the calculated duct friction loss.\n \nIn the \"Range of Duct Sizes\" mode, you can specify minimum and maximum friction loss and airflow values to display a range of duct sizes that fall in between the friction loss bounds.\n \nYou can specify additional parameters such as the duct shape (rectangular, round, or oval), the air temperature and the air pressure. You can also choose to display values in either English (IP) or Metric (SI) units.\n \nThis application uses slider controls that allow you to quickly increment or decrement the input values and immediately observe the calculated results.\n \nThis app now works on your iPhone and iPad and adjusts its screen size accordingly.\n \nFinally, you can email all of the inputs and results from all 3 input modes to perform further analysis using your desktop computer. The email includes HTML text and a .CSV attachment that can be imported into any popular spreadsheet.\n \nThe ASHRAE HVAC Duct Sizer application was designed by Carmel Software Corporation for ASHRAE."

Then, export the layout as an image, or as a CSV file.\n\nThe app supports multiple rack designs.\n\nRather than incorporating a vast symbol library, by allowing you to select the device icon from your device gallery, you can feature symbols, manufacturer logos or other appropriate images.\n\nDevice colours can be separated into industry standards, blue for audio, green for video, or be adjusted to suit your company brand colours.\n\nThe app is designed to provide rack layout only, and does not allow for connections to be shown between devices."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

Thanks for a solid app!\"\n\n\"Nice, clean app for transferring files and updating HTML and CSS. The editor is nice and easy to use, common symbols very quickly accessed. Support responded quickly and was very helpful at helping me set everything up right.\"\n\n\"I've been looking for a simple/complete file transfer app so that I can securely put and get files between my iPad and PC. I wish I had tried this before all of the other train wrecks! Great job on the app!!\"\n\n\"I was out of my office and needed to fix a PHP script for one of my clients, and that worked perfect for me. \nI totally recommend.\"\n\n\nYou can test the free Lite version of \"FTP Client Pro\" called \"FTP Client Lite\".\n\n\nIF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY PROBLEMS OR HAVE QUESTIONS/SUGGESTIONS PLEASE CONTACT: LessIsMoreDevelopment@gmail.com"

      "label": "This is a recorder for long-time recording usage, only record stronger sound so that you can save power, storage and playback time, especially good for sleeping status recording, such as snoring, cough at night etc. , also you can get to know the specific time and period when snoring at night, know your sleeping quality, whether or not you have apnea issue etc.\n    \nMore Features:\n* For long recording,greatly extend the effective length of recording time,saving power and storage space. \n\n* All files are named by the date and time stamp automatically,and can be sorted by date.\n\n* Users can add a label to any file manually.\n\n* Mute time length can be set by users from 5s to 30s.\n\n* All of files can be played continuously by one click after checking the auto play option.\n\n* Multiple sharing features: File sharing of iTunes, WiFi download in a browser, Email.\n\n* For continuous recording, set the threshold value to zero.\n\n* Storage space reminder feature when the storage space less than 200MB.\n\n \n\n******Tips for using******* \n1. Press power button, you can see signal strength bar moving, then slide the thumb to set the threshold (0.00~1.00), the value will be saved for next time use. \n\n2.If the indicator start flashing, that means a real recording start. check the recorded files,some test files can be found  there . \n\n3.In each scenario, the threshold value could be different, set it according to the situation. For example,for snoring and dream talk recording at night, set the value to 0.05, but at daytime, you probably have to set it at 0.10. \n\n4. Attention for naming a label: all files can be saved to your computer. Label,as a part of a file name, has to follow some rules for different computer OS.For this app, make it simple as follows,the name length is better to be limited to within 125 characters,as for the kind of characters, for Windows,you can't use ?\\|/ etc. in your label, otherwise iTunes will report a error such as no files found, just rename it as windows' requirement to fix it.\n\n\n**About Volume**\nSpeaker mode or earphone mode,  the speaker hardware is shared by all apps in your device, please check both modes and adjust the volume if you can't hear anything.\n\n**How to download recording files**\nFor file downloading,  iTunes File sharing Feature is recommended.  The basic steps : connect to iTunes->click \"iPhone\" ->click \"App\"->scroll down to find \"File sharing\"->click this app's icon -> select recording fils on the right box ->click \" Save\".

All of your member data is stored in the cloud and is accessible on any of your devices, no matter where you are (with internet connection).  You can see members whose membership is expiring soon, track members birthdays, send a message or email to your members, and perform many other organizational tasks.\n\nHere's an example review from one of our users:\n\nThe Mug Club app is a tool that our brewery needed. We were lucky enough to have implemented this app when we were only a few hundred members in and only a couple of dozen mugs to keep track of. We now use this app to track the close to 2000 total members we have had and about 700 mugs with their location! We can see easily, who is a lifetime member, who is a current annual member and who has expired. We can get pictures of our members and take notes on them to help us get to know our customers better. Exporting our member list is simple. Entering a new member is also very easy. This app is so user friendly. It is a must-have for any brewery that plans to have a mug club.\n\nRequires iOS 9.0 or later"

You can save the subnets which you manage in a hierarchy so that you can keep track of how you have allocated and split up your subnets into smaller subnets. Also, you can add hosts inside each subnet so that you can keep track of IP allocations. For each defined subnet, Subnet Calc Pro will calculate all details including its class and even whether or not the IP is in the loopback / private ranges.\n\nThere is also a handy subnet FINDER which is an aggregator and can be used to calculate the smallest subnet which encompasses a given set of IPs. This can be useful if you need to figure out a subnet mask which will allow a given set of IPs to talk to each other.\n\nAlso included is a standard subnet CALCULATOR which is the same as the free version of the software called Subnet Calc.\n\nFinally, you can even export all your data from the database by email."

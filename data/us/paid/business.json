In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

By simply logging on, you can signal to the delivery company your current location and that you are ready to receive work requests.

Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

First, decision-makers should consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. If the objective is not attainable, they must select a different objective and repeat the process.\n\nUsers of SWOT analysis must ask and answer questions that generate meaningful information for each category (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) to make the analysis useful and find their competitive advantage."

      "label": "A must have for Professional Snow Plowers!  Plus it keeps getting better with each update!  Get the edge over your competition.\n\nHow long do you have to snow plow to pay for this app?  Minutes!  Think of it as less than the cost of (2) bags of ice melt or roughly 5% of a new cutting edge on your plow .  Think of it as the cheapest thing you will buy for your snow removal business besides the snacks at the gas station.  \n\nRead everything below to understand why it's worth purchasing....\n\nSnowClient was created by someone that has been in your shoes (snow boots), snow plowing through the night to have the properties clear by morning.\n\nThink about it!  No more clipboards, paper, and handwriting.  Handwriting that is hard to read and takes forever to organize to be able to invoice snow customers after the snow storm is over.  All the while you are hoping that your paperwork notes don't blow away, fall in the snow, or get stolen.  Then how are you supposed to know what hours to bill for and all the other information that was on that piece of paper?  The SnowClient app takes care of all of this.  \n\nWith SnowClient it is easy to document all the work you do and have it immediately organized and accessible in case your snow removal clients want to know when you serviced their property or how deep the snow was when you did service it.  You will have the info at your fingertips and will impress them with your ability to know the facts on the spot.\n\nNo more hours spent calculating your hours for each property to know what to put on the invoice.  It is done the moment you finish servicing the snow account and push stop.\n\nThen when invoicing, all you do is use the sort feature to filter by property and you have all the information you need to invoice for that specific property!\n\nYou can also sort by date and team leader (this could be the driver).\n\nAlso if you put the full address into the property info you or your employees can just click on it to get directions to that property.\n\nSimplify your snow business and minimize the headaches & work after the snow storm.   \n\nSnowClient Helps You Keep Track of:\n\n- Property Names\n\n- Property Details (Address, Deadline Time, Etc.)\n\n- Time Spent Working at Each Property\n\n- Employee Information (if needed)\n\n- Amounts of Salt or De-icing Materials Used at Each Property to be Billed for Later\n\n- Additional Notes - Write Notes and Other Messages That Are Unique to Your Company's Way of Doing Business or Other Information You Would Like but There is no Spot For it.\n\n- Which Employees Serviced Which Properties\n(Employees on the job)\n\nSnowClient Also Will:\n\n- Assist in Accurate Billing\n\n- Keep Work Information Organized\n\n- Create Documentation to Help in Legal Matters\n\n- And So Much More in the Future!\n\n***What this app does NOT do:\n\n- Store Your Information in the Cloud (all the info is stored on your phone)\n\n- Login for Different Users or Privileges\n\n- Sync Information Across Different Users Devices \n\n- Export to Excel or Quickbooks BUT there IS exporting (text, email, etc.)\n\n- Print (unless you export to notes then you can print from notes)\n\nWe know there are probably a lot more features including the ones listed under \"What this app is not\" that you would like to be able to have to help you manage your snow removal properties, snow removal employees, and snow removal customers.  \n\nPLEASE share your ideas with us so we can incorporate them into the app to better serve your needs.  We want to make sure you are satisfied!  We would like to see all 5 Star Reviews so help us out and give us feedback before slamming us with a bad review.  If your life is better because of this app then give us a good review:)  As snow plowers we know what it is like to only hear complaints and on the other side how good it feels when somebody appreciates the work we performed.\n\nSend us a message on our Facebook page by following the Support Link.  We are here for you!"

Scan a VIN barcode in just a few seconds using the autofocus camera on your iPhone 4S and newer. Or enter the VIN using the keyboard.\n\nThis app was created for automotive professionals such as dealership managers and salespeople, as well as car enthusiasts and anyone who wants to keep a list of vehicles with photos.\n\nNo subscription, in-app purchase or decoding fee is required to use the full features of VIN Inventory.\n\nVIN Inventory quickly authenticates and then decodes the vehicle VIN (serial number) and displays rich details including year, make, model, engine, equipment and optional accessory items. The user may add stock number (or tag number), color, odometer reading, price, and a note about the car. 3 photos can be added using the iPhone camera or Camera Roll. Equipment items can be added or changed. The user may choose to either add the vehicle to their saved inventory list or delete the vehicle after a quick review. Previously saved vehicle data can be edited or deleted from the list and photos can be updated.\n\nThe Vehicle List display screen is a scrolling table of all saved vehicles complete with your thumbnail photos. You can email a text file of ALL of the vehicles in your list. Tapping on a specific vehicle causes a Detail View to be displayed with vehicle specifications, equipment options and vehicle photos.\nTap on a photo to see an enlarged image of the vehicle. \n\nSend an email of a single vehicle that includes all of the vehicle info and 3 photos.\n\nVIN Inventory accepts vehicles produced after 1981 (17 digit VINs). Data coverage is for North American vehicles and omits data for exotic vehicles and older vehicles that are not commonly found on dealership car lots.\n\nAutoPlus produces other vehicle inventory tools with such features as upload, download, import, and export of vehicle data, multiple photos, label printing and other powerful functions.\n\nThis VIN Inventory app is an extension of our 20-year-old AutoPlus Window Sticker business (a division of Tanner Communications).

      "label": "\"This productivity app is designed to allow copyright owners the ability to enforce their rights by the quick and easy creation of a legal Notification of Infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA Notice”). QuickDMCA permits copyright owners, or their agents, to expeditiously send DMCA Notices to ISP’s, hosts, billing processors, or other companies providing services to publishers of infringing content.  Under federal law, after receiving a DMCA Notice, the service provider is obligated to disable access to the content or cease providing services to the infringing material.  Repeat infringers must have their accounts permanently terminated.  QuickDMCA allows users to protect their valuable content from online piracy, at the touch of a button.  The application will allow the user to generate a DMCA Notice that contains all the necessary legal statements and information required by federal law, in minutes.  Copyright lawsuits can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to pursue, with no guaranty of result.  DMCA Notices can cause infringing content to be quickly removed from the Internet – often in a matter of days…or even hours!  Online service providers like hosts, third party billing processors, name servers, and payment gateways, must respond to DMCA Notices promptly, or risk becoming vicariously liable for infringement caused by their customers or subscribers.  QuickDMCA solves a common cyber-theft problem encountered by publishers of creative content such as pictures, videos, music, software, or graphics. Policing the unauthorized reproduction of your expressive works has never been easier, with QuickDMCA.  \n\nQuick DMCA™ allows you to:\n- Create a DMCA Notice containing all the required elements mandated by the DMCA, including:\n    Your contact information, email address, and website; \n    The name of the online service provider associated with the infringing content;\n    The location of the infringing content;\n    Sworn statements as to good faith belief of infringement; and,\n    The necessary electronic signature\n- Find the proper Designated Agent associated with specific online service providers\n- Execute the DMCA Notice on your touch screen, to capture your e-signature\n- Send the DMCA Notice directly from your mobile device to the company providing services to the infringer, in both plain text and       .pdf formats\n - Receive a copy of the transmitted DMCA Notice for your records\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., Internet attorney and inventor of the patented BirthDateVerifer™, the Quick2257® mobile app, and other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting DMCA Notices for the purpose of enforcing copyrights and taking down infringing material.  Anyone involved in the creation or publication of digital media can now quickly generate and send the necessary Notification of Infringement under federal law, using this simple mobile app.\n\nFor more information on DMCA copyright enforcement or other legal issues, please contact: http://www.firstamendment.com\n \n Note: Nothing contained on this site is intended as legal advice. Please consult with a competent copyright attorney for advice on proper use of this application and enforcement of intellectual property rights."

SA Contacts sends all of your contacts to you from your iPhone in a convenient zip file by email, USB, or through a webpage seen only on your local wifi network! Contact photos are sent, too!\n3.

SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16. All column headers and labels in the Excel file are localized.\n17. Export/Import contacts to/from a VCF file.\n18. Backup contacts before import.\n19. Manage groups easily. You can now create, edit, delete groups and add contacts to groups.\n20. Export an Excel file with all photos included - this makes the contacts in your spreadsheet look better.\n21.

Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

Tap Forms 5 helps you organize all kinds of things in one place — secure, searchable, and accessible on your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch (Mac app sold separately).\n\nHow can one app organize everything? Because not only can you use and customize the more than 30 built-in templates but you can create your own “forms” for inputting any kind of information, even if that information includes pictures, doodles, audio recordings, calculations, file attachments, ratings, or even links to other forms.

Get started with one of our ready-to-go form templates, or easily make a custom one from scratch with our integrated form building tools.\n\n• Store confidential data with confidence: Tap Forms' security settings let you optionally require a password or a Touch ID scan, and even auto-lock when idle for a custom period of time. Using AES encryption, you can rest easy knowing your data is safe and secure.\n\n• Import, Export, Share: It’s easy to import your data from existing files, so getting started is a breeze. Import your data from text, CSV, Bento and more. One-tap exporting allows you to share with Mac, Windows, and Linux users.\n\nAdvanced Features:\n\n• Scripting support for writing JavaScript code for performing all kinds of operations on your forms and records.\n• Siri Shortcuts let you record a voice command to execute any Form script.\n• Multi-column (table) view of your records.\n• AirDrop records to your nearby contacts.\n• Sync with Tap Forms for iOS and Mac using iCloud, IBM Cloudant, Nearby (WiFi), or with your own Apache CouchDB sync server.\n• Saved search rules with multi-field record filtering\n• Built-in Backup & Restore\n• 1Password Extension integration for logging into your Cloudant sync account.\n• Document Picker support for accessing iCloud and other document service providers.\n• Pick lists for quick data entry\n• AES-256 bit encryption\n• Import & Export standard CSV files from Excel, Numbers, or other systems\n• Print record details\n• Lightning fast search\n• Share form templates with friends, family, and co-workers\n• Notify you of things that need your attention using alerts\n• Barcode scanning of UPC/EAN and QR codes (iOS only)\n\nStore 25 different types of information, such as:\n\n• Script\n• Table\n• Link to form (relational links between forms)\n• Inverse relationships\n• File Attachment with multi-file support\n• Email address\n• GPS location\n• Contact\n• Text\n• Date\n• Time\n• Date & time\n• Number\n• Rating\n• Web site address\n• Check mark\n• Note\n• Audio notes (record on iOS, playback on Mac)\n• Photos\n• Drawings (draw on iOS, view on Mac)\n• Phone number\n• Section headings\n• Calculations\n• Signatures\n\nIncludes more than 30 built-in forms, including:\n\n• Audio dictation\n• Bank accounts\n• Clients\n• Client call log\n• Credit & debit cards\n• Daily journal\n• Expenses\n• Frequent flyer numbers\n• Health insurance\n• Homework assignments\n• Loyalty cards\n• Personal health cards\n• Security alarm codes\n• Serial numbers\n• Vehicle insurance\n• Website accounts\n• Wine collection"

Then, export the layout as an image, or as a CSV file.\n\nThe app supports multiple rack designs.\n\nRather than incorporating a vast symbol library, by allowing you to select the device icon from your device gallery, you can feature symbols, manufacturer logos or other appropriate images.\n\nDevice colours can be separated into industry standards, blue for audio, green for video, or be adjusted to suit your company brand colours.\n\nThe app is designed to provide rack layout only, and does not allow for connections to be shown between devices."

The date and start odometer are entered automatically.\n \nThere are no pretty graphs, fancy reports or a multitude of settings, just simple, quick entries.\n \nAll entries can be exported to a CSV file for manipulation (graphs and wiz-bang formulas) in a spreadsheet.\n\nFeatures details:\n- Add entries for each trip including distance, places, reasons and general notes.\n- 1 to 3 taps for a new entry\n- Include start and end times, if required\n- Export to CSV\n- PDF by month, last month, last 3 months, last year, or all\n- Email CSV and PDF\n- Popup monthly summaries"

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

There is no centralized (shared) storage space on your device. This means that this app's proprietary printing engine only works within this app. The iOS cannot use this app to print files within another app's storage space—for example, files stored in Pages, Numbers, Safari, Notes, Mail, etc. Therefore, files created in other apps must be imported into this app.)\n\n\nHOW DO I IMPORT FILES INTO THIS APP?\n• Use a web browser to transfer files between your computer and this app.\n• Use iTunes to upload files into this app.\n• Use a WebDAV server to transfer files.\n• Email a file to yourself. Then, open the Mail app, press and hold down the attachment until the \"Open In...\" menu appears. Select this app from the list of apps displayed.\n\n\nIS THERE HELP AVAILABLE?\nYes. In addition to the built-in user guide, you can also ask questions via our real-time chat Customer Support module.\n\n\n\n[1] Each fax unit purchases a one-page fax that can be sent in 60 seconds or less to a destination in the United States or Canada. The number of fax units needed to transmit a one-page 60-second fax to a destination in another country is listed in the rate card within this app. Please note that a page that requires a longer transmission time (for example, a page containing high resolution graphics) consumes additional fax units.\n[2] To receive voicemail or faxes, you must setup an incoming toll-free phone number. The toll-free phone number requires a monthly subscription. 60 minutes/month are included free with subscription. Toll-free numbers are USA-based numbers and are accessible in the United States only.\nOptional Toll Free Number Subscription Notes: \n• Title: Toll-Free Number Subscription\n• Length: 1,3, 6 or 12 month options \n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at purchase confirmation\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n• No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active period \n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase\n• Privacy Policy: https://www.ndilitechnologies.com/privacy.html\n• Terms of use: https://www.ndilitechnologies.com/termsofuse.html"

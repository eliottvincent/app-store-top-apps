To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

The results include both the exact and rounded height and width (or diameter) dimensions and the calculated velocity and friction loss.\n \nIn the \"Size by Dimensions\" mode, you can analyze an existing duct system. There are options to input the existing duct dimensions and one of either the airflow or velocity values to derive the calculated duct friction loss.\n \nIn the \"Range of Duct Sizes\" mode, you can specify minimum and maximum friction loss and airflow values to display a range of duct sizes that fall in between the friction loss bounds.\n \nYou can specify additional parameters such as the duct shape (rectangular, round, or oval), the air temperature and the air pressure. You can also choose to display values in either English (IP) or Metric (SI) units.\n \nThis application uses slider controls that allow you to quickly increment or decrement the input values and immediately observe the calculated results.\n \nThis app now works on your iPhone and iPad and adjusts its screen size accordingly.\n \nFinally, you can email all of the inputs and results from all 3 input modes to perform further analysis using your desktop computer. The email includes HTML text and a .CSV attachment that can be imported into any popular spreadsheet.\n \nThe ASHRAE HVAC Duct Sizer application was designed by Carmel Software Corporation for ASHRAE."

      "label": "The Liberty Item Entry App is designed to allow users of Resaleworld's popular Liberty software to enter and update inventory while on the go. Accounts can be added and updated as well. This app allows store employees to move to wherever they need to be with the convenience of a mobile device, while still having the ability access and enter information.This app helps improve productivity and helps to overcome a number of logistical challenges. The Item Entry App is ideal for the following scenarios: adding photographs to large amounts of new or existing inventory; adding large furniture which is difficult to relocate to a PC with a full installation of Liberty software; traveling to estate sales to add inventory; adding and updating inventory stored in a warehouse.\n\nThe item entry interface includes several design features that are optimized for a touch-screen, smaller display for popular mobile devices. A list of the 20 most commonly used categories speeds up item entry considerably. A graphical trend analysis tool calculates and displays pricing information based on the category and brand of the item being entered, based on the past year's sales data. Adding photographs to items is simple and quick both when using images from the device's photo library or when taking new pictures with the device's camera.  This app also allows users to print tags for inventory, to email item lists directly to accountholders, and to view an account's transaction history.\n\nThis app requires an installation Liberty Software (Liberty REACT, Liberty 5, Liberty 4 Consignment, or Liberty 4 Trading Assistants) and either a qualifying Web Service plan or a stand-alone Liberty Mobile Access license. Please contact Resaleworld with any questions about Liberty Mobile Access eligibility."

For Hourly calculation please enter rate and hours (OT, DT) and the Gross Pay amount will be automatically calculated!\n-----------------------------------------\n\nUnlimited profiles \n-----------------------------------------\nPayroll Guru app allows for unlimited number of profiles to cover every employee or a group of similarly taxed employees. Profiles can be saved and edited and include state, marital status, pay period, allowances and deductions information.\n\n8 pre-tax or post-tax deductions\n-----------------------------------------\nPayrollguru app allows up to 8 pre-tax and/or post-tax deductions, which are setup as a fixed amount deduction or a % of gross pay. Deductions are customizable and can differ from one profile to another. The deductions can be modified to accommodate various taxing scenarios. For example for 401K deduction - select pretax and turn ON Federal and State switches to exclude it from being taxed on federal and state levels.\n\nOnce you enter all information and include year-to-date gross paid wages, Payroll Guru will calculate your net paycheck amount and will show you the appropraite taxes.\n\nPayroll Guru calculates the following taxes: \n- Federal WIthholding, \n- Social Security, \n- Medicare, \n- State Withholding, \n- State Unemployment (where applicable), \n- State Disability Insurance (where applicable). \n\nCalculated paychecks can be viewed as a pie chart showing the percentage distribution of your gross pay. Paycheck details can be emailed to an employee, employer or a payroll service provider. \n\nPayrollguru app is a must have for any self-employed person or employer in the US to calculate paychecks and verify accuracy of issued paychecks. \n\nPayrollguru app will also be useful to any employee looking to improve financial planning, budget spending and estimate impact of personal changes (i.e. marital status, number of dependents) on net take home amount. \n\nEmployees can also use Payroll Guru app to compare net paycheck amounts (after tax) in different states. This will be useful for employees considering job or relocation to a different state.  \n\nFor small business owners and payroll service providers Payrollguru will help estimate net and gross paycheck amounts in a particular payroll situation, and will provide a pretty accurate assessment of applicable payroll taxes.\n\nPayrollguru app calculates payroll taxes for all 50 states and District of Columbia. \n\nIf you have any improvement suggestions or would like to report a problem please email us directly at support@payrollguru.mobi. \n\nWe also appreciate your positive feedback and reviews.

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

See why tens of thousands of engineers, technicians, and architects have licensed our software for their HVAC engineering needs.\n\n(For full online help, click here: http://bit.ly/1GlRulY.\n\nFor training webinar, click here: http://bit.ly/1IHn7nA)\n\nThis app now includes the HVAC Equipment Locator. Click here for details: http://bit.ly/1yTq539.\n\nThis app allows you to perform detailed block and room-by-room heating and cooling loads for residential buildings out in the field, by taking advantage of the simplicity and power of the iPhone.\n\nThis app was designed by Carmel Software Corporation, a 25-year old software design firm specializing in engineering analysis software applications. We are not just 1 person designing mobile apps out of a bedroom. We are a team of software developers and engineers with over 50 years combined software and engineering design experience. In fact, our software powers the analysis capabilities of major Autodesk (The makers of AutoCAD) software tools such as Autodesk Revit. \n\nThe following is just a small sample of the features included in this app:\n\n1. Calculations based upon abridged ACCA Manual J8 calculations (This is not an ACCA-approved app. For our ACCA-approved iPad app, search for the HVAC ResLoad-J app on the app store)\n\n2. Includes a 1000+ world-wide city weather database\n\n3. Includes data for 100s of construction types for walls, roofs, floors, doors, windows, skylights, ceilings, and more\n\n4. Allows you to create and store an unlimited number of projects\n\n5. Allows you to create an unlimited number of rooms and view individual loads and airflows for those rooms\n\n6. Allows you to specify an unlimited # of opaque types (ie – doors, walls, roofs, floors, ceilings), window types, and skylight types for each building\n\n7. Allows you to instantly view total heating and cooling load results as you update input data\n\n8. Allows you to view comprehensive cooling and heating load breakdown reports including breakdown by opaque load, window load, skylight load, infiltration load, ventilation load and internal load contributions\n\n9. Opaque inputs include opaque type, opaque construction number, dimensions, and opening areas\n\n10. Window inputs include window type, internal and external shading type, overhang dimensions, window area, and more..\n\n11. Additional input types include # of people, # of bedrooms, ventilation airflow, and more..\n\n12. Includes ability to display a wide variety of on-screen reports including checksum reports (ie – BTUh/SqFt, SqFt/Ton, etc.), complete heating and cooling load breakdown reports, and even graphically-pleasing pie charts showing cooling and heating load breakdowns\n\n13. Includes the ability to display a comprehensive HTML report that you can email to yourself or others, and it also includes a spreadsheet attachment that you can open in Excel to further massage data on your desktop\n\n14. Includes English (IP) or Metric (SI) units\n\n15. This is the same technology that powers the Trane MAP iPad app that they offer to their elite dealer network\n\nThe benefits of using this app are numerous including:\n\n1. Great for use out in the field. Quickly size heating and cooling equipment, show the client, then email the results back to your office for further analysis.\n\n2. Show off your advanced on-screen reports to clients convincing them you are using cutting-edge technology\n\n3. Save time by inputting information in the field and then returning to your office to perform more in-depth analysis"

Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

Save generated and scanned barcodes in a local database and restore them at any moment.\nData matrixbarcode  encodes a large number of characters in an area as small as few millimeters, DataMatrix barcodes occupy less space than other barcodes. Available on iPhone and iPad. \nDatamatrix is a matrix two-dimensional barcode which may be printed as a square or rectangular symbol made up of individual squares. Data matrix is a graphical representation of data in a machine readable form, used to enable automatic reading of the Element Strings. \nDatamatrix barcode is composed of two separate parts : the finder pattern, which is used by the scanner to locate the symbol, and the encoded data itself. \nThe finder pattern defines the shape (square or rectangle), the size, X-dimension and the number of rows and columns in the symbol. It has a function similar to the Auxiliary Patterns (Start, Stop and Centre patterns) in an EAN/UPC barcode and allows the scanner to identify the symbol as a Data matrix barcode.\nThe solid dark is called the “L finder pattern”. It is primarily used to determine the size, orientation and distortion of the data matrix barcode.\nThe other two sides of the finder pattern are alternating light and dark elements, known as the “Clock Track”. This defines the basic structure of the datamatrix and can also help determine its size and distortion.\nThe data is then encoded in a matrix within the Finder pattern. This is a translation into the binary Datamatrix symbology characters (numeric or alphanumeric)."

Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14.

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

      "label": "The best, most powerful, comprehensive, easy to use time keeping app on the Apple Store is now even better.\n\nOur biggest fans are consultants, attorneys and contractors. Time Master is used by individuals working independently, to attorneys from some of the biggest law firms in the USA. If you need to keep track of time and expenses, you can’t find a better app than Time Master. We at On-Core are IT professionals, so we have firsthand experience with billing and keeping track of time. We know from personal experience what is needed and have made this app so flexible, it works for virtually anyone in any industry in which time needs to be kept.\n\nFeatures:\n- Track time by start, stop and/or by duration\n- Sessions option can track \"punch-in & out\" for a single time entry\n- Single or multiple running timers\n- Timers keep running even if you are not running the app\n- Time Entries are by Client and can be sub-categorized by Project and Tasks\n- Powerful billing rates that can be defined in the following priority: Global, by Client, by Project, by Task or Custom per entry\n- Powerful Time Rounding: by hour, minutes and/or seconds\n- Multiple Filters to sort and view only what you need to see\n- Define the day of the week that your work week starts\n- Track Expenses - from Mileage to Meals to Burning CD's and anything else you want to define\n- Display Reports right on your device that you can view and export via email in HTML and/or CSV format. By Client or Timesheet\n- Copy Client information from your Contacts list\n- Dual taxes for countries such as Canada\n- Import IIF files\n- Full Backup & Restore capabilities\n- and so much more!\n\nOPTIONAL MODULES (one-time additional fee required as an \"In App Purchase\"):\n- Invoicing: If you want to do billing directly from your iPhone or iPod Touch then look no further. The most powerful invoicing module built directly into Time Master. Professional PDF invoices can be emailed to the client, including your own logo.\n- Quickbooks Export: Easily export your Time Entries with a QB IIF file. Win QB 2007 Pro or greater.

You can track time using start and stop times, duration, and/or timers. All time entries are tracked for a single day, so time entries cannot be greater than 24 hours. It will allow you to time across days, for example if you start a job at 8 p.m. and finish at 2 a.m., it will have a duration of 6 hours.\n\nExpenses can be setup for recurring fixed cost items, such as burning a CD, reimbursement of hardware items, or fluid things such as toll expenses, automobile mileage, etc.\n\nQuick reporting can be done on the iPhone / iPod Touch with the Reports function. The report can be emailed in an HTML and/or CSV format.\n\nAdding new Clients, Projects, Tasks and Expenditures is super easy.  You can create them on the fly without having to navigate to a separate maintenance screen. To edit them you can tap on Setup, do you edit and then return to where you left off in Time Entries or Expenses. By selecting a Project or Task first will automatically fill in the Client field for quick entry.\n\nWe’ve made everything as seamless as possible, as you would expect from a top class iOS application.

      "label": "The Liberty Item Entry App is designed to allow users of Resaleworld's popular Liberty software to enter and update inventory while on the go. Accounts can be added and updated as well. This app allows store employees to move to wherever they need to be with the convenience of a mobile device, while still having the ability access and enter information.This app helps improve productivity and helps to overcome a number of logistical challenges. The Item Entry App is ideal for the following scenarios: adding photographs to large amounts of new or existing inventory; adding large furniture which is difficult to relocate to a PC with a full installation of Liberty software; traveling to estate sales to add inventory; adding and updating inventory stored in a warehouse.\n\nThe item entry interface includes several design features that are optimized for a touch-screen, smaller display for popular mobile devices. A list of the 20 most commonly used categories speeds up item entry considerably. A graphical trend analysis tool calculates and displays pricing information based on the category and brand of the item being entered, based on the past year's sales data. Adding photographs to items is simple and quick both when using images from the device's photo library or when taking new pictures with the device's camera.  This app also allows users to print tags for inventory, to email item lists directly to accountholders, and to view an account's transaction history.\n\nThis app requires an installation Liberty Software (Liberty REACT, Liberty 5, Liberty 4 Consignment, or Liberty 4 Trading Assistants) and either a qualifying Web Service plan or a stand-alone Liberty Mobile Access license. Please contact Resaleworld with any questions about Liberty Mobile Access eligibility."

A SWOT analysis can be carried out for a company, product, place, industry, or person. It involves specifying the objectives of the business venture or project and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieve that objective. \n\nStrengths: characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others\n\nWeaknesses: characteristics of the business that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others\n\nOpportunities: elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage\n\nThreats: elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project\n\n\nIdentification of SWOTs is important because they can inform later steps in planning to achieve the objective. First, decision-makers should consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. If the objective is not attainable, they must select a different objective and repeat the process.\n\nUsers of SWOT analysis must ask and answer questions that generate meaningful information for each category (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) to make the analysis useful and find their competitive advantage."

Smart PDF Scanner uses it fully to make the best possible scans. Even full-page articles come out tack-sharp and easy to read.\n\nIt automatically detects the page edges and corrects for perspective. Pick full-color scans, grayscale, or black-and-white for maximum legibility. FlashAssist can take perfect scans even in poor lighting conditions. You can even change the correction and enhancement settings after the fact.\n\nPOWERFUL COLOR-CODED ORGANIZATION\nScanning is just half the problem. You need a good way to keep all your documents organized, and easy to find later. Smart PDF Scanner uses a simple tagging system that is much easier and more powerful than the regular folder system. File documents under custom color-coded categories with just a couple taps. Browse and sort files by category with a couple more.\n\nIt's the way filing should work.\n\nEASY TO SHARE\nExport scans as PDFs or images, and email or print directly from the App. Files can also be shared via AirDrop, or sent to another App.\n\nEasily upload to Dropbox, Google Drive, and other cloud services with the corresponding third party App. Send PDFs and images to services such as Evernote or OneNote to take advantage of their OCR capabilities.\n\nFOR ALL YOUR SCANNING NEEDS\n+ Quickly scan and send contracts and forms\n+ Keep scans of important documents in your pocket, separate form the Photo Library\n+ Scan all your travel receipts for easy expense reports\n+ Keep digital copies of your notes and sketches\n+ Scan articles and send them to iBooks to read on the go\n+ And more!\n\nAPPS BUILT FOR PROFESSIONALS\nSmart PDF Scanner uses the latest technologies packed into your iPhone and iPad, but we've worked hard to make it as easy and fast to use as possible. Intelligent image processing eliminates the need for fiddling with complicated controls. That way, you can focus on getting the job done, and doing what you do best.\n\nTIPS AND TRICKS\nHere are a few tips to get the best scans:\n+ Place your document on a darker surface to improve the edge auto-detection.\n+ You can drag the corners of the blue rectangle to fine tune it after taking a photo.\n+ Make sure there is adequate lighting. Use the flash in low-light conditions.\n+ You can tap on a page to edit its scan settings (including edges) after the fact.\n\nMADE BY DEVELOPERS WHO CARE\nWe are dedicated to handcrafting the best possible Apps for your iPhone and iPad, and we hope you enjoy using Smart PDF Scanner. If you have any additional questions, please drop us a line via our feedback page.\n\nBest regards,\n\n-- The App Makers @ Qrayon."

The transverse connections are limited to T1 (flat drive), T5 (flat slip), T10, 11, and 12 (standing slips) and T25 a or b (TDC/TDF).  Where appropriate the app will also provide options for intermediate reinforcement.  The full range of reinforcement spacing options is 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 ½, and 2 feet.\n\nIn most cases the app will provide options for internal reinforcements and external reinforcements.  Internal options are limited to EMT conduit tie rods and external reinforcements are limited to angles.  Enough information is provided so users can choose other options from SMACNA’s Standard.\n\nThe output of the app is a written description of the duct as well as a graphic representation.  Users can view the report on-screen or email it.\n\nThe app does not provide every possible solution found in SMACNA’s standard and it will not provide every detail.  For example, the app does not provide requirements for the proper attachment of the reinforcements.  The app is intended to be used in conjunction with SMACNA’s HVAC Duct Construction Standard."

Gantt chart view helps you keep an eye on tasks durations, start and due dates, completion percentage, dependencies and resources assigned. \n• Resources management: add resources to your project: people or materials, necessary to make this project done. Identify bottlenecks in your project and distribute workloads fairly. \n• Multiple baselines: set baseline to track development by comparing the set baseline with actual plan and progress. \n• Critical path: Project Office displays your project’s critical path, which is the series of tasks that are necessary in order to finish your project on schedule. \n• Customized calendar: modifying work hours for entire project you can create a more realistic plan considering off-time and weekends. \n• Filtering: you can easily hide those tasks you don't need to think about at the moment. Simply use filter to focus on tasks you need to be done. \n• Projects and reports sharing: send an entire project to your colleagues or Email the Gantt chart to others as PDF. For more convenience you can make task and resources report and send them as HTML. \n• iCloud backup: backup your projects to keep all information you have added \n\n• IMPORT/EXPORT Microsoft Project® (XML) \nProject Office can export and import files with Microsoft Project® (XML) format. Project Office does not support export/import MPP files. To use Microsoft Project® (XML) export/import, you need to buy one-time purchase license. \n\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.dk-consulting.app/privacy-policy\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula"

      "label": "The NATE Toolkit+ app was developed by Carmel Software for North American Technical Excellence, Inc. (NATE). This app is the essential app for anyone in the HVAC industry. It is a compilation of most of the individual iPhone and iPad applications offered by Carmel Software plus bonus software.\n\nIf you bought each of these apps separately, it would cost more than 2 times what the price of this app is. It includes:\n\n1. HVAC Residential Load Calc HD (iPad version)\n1. HVAC Residential Load Calcs (iPhone version)\n1. HVAC Equipment Locator\n2. HVAC PT Chart\n3. HVAC Refrigerant Charge\n4. HVAC Duct Sizer\n2. HVAC Quick Load\n6. ASHRAE Ventilation Calcs (iPhone version)\n7. Psychrometrics\n8. Steam Tables\n9. HVAC Pipe Sizer - Liquid\n10. HVAC Pipe Sizer - Steam\n11. HVAC Pipe Sizer - Gas Low\n12. HVAC Pipe Sizer - Gas High\n\nThe \"HVAC Residential Load Calcs\" module allows you to perform comprehensive HVAC block and room-by-room load calculations for small commercial and residential buildings. You can easily use this module out in the field by taking advantage of the simplicity and power of the iPhone or iPad, and then email results back to your office.\n\nThe \"HVAC Equipment Locator\" module allows you to track, share, and customize your equipment nameplate and maintenance data. The version here includes the ability to customize your input screens (this is an in-app purchase on the free stand-alone version of Locator).\n\nThe \"HVAC PT Chart\" module allows you to easily view the pressure-temperature properties of 75 refrigerants. Think of this app as a digital version of the paper PT charts that you may have carried around with you in the past.\n\nThe \"HVAC Refrigerant Charge\" module allows you to perform superheat and subcool refrigerant charge calculations on-the-fly. This app includes pressure-temperature data for over 75 common refrigerants.\n\nThe \"HVAC Duct Sizer\" module allows you to perform quick and simple duct sizing analysis. You can specify the total airflow in CFM (or L/s), the aspect ratio and one of either the velocity of air or the friction loss per 100 feet (30 meters). The results include both the exact and rounded height and width (or diameter) dimensions and the calculated velocity and friction loss. In addition, you can calculate for a range of duct sizes by specifying minimum and maximum friction loss and airflow values. \n\nThe \"HVAC Quick Load\" module allows you to quickly calculate total heating and cooling loads for a wide variety of building types.\n\nThe \"Psychrometrics\" module allows you to easily perform single-state and mixed-air HVAC psychrometric calculations for up to 23 different combinations of input parameters.\n\nThe \"Steam Tables\" module allows you to calculate the properties of saturated or superheated steam by specifying 2 input properties. This module is also part of the \"Pipe Sizer - Steam\" module discussed below.\n\nThe \"ASHRAE Ventilation Calcs\" module allows you to perform comprehensive minimum ventilation calculations for a wide variety of commercial buildings based upon ASHRAE Standard 62.11-2007 and 2010 versions.\n\nThe \"HVAC Pipe Sizer - Liquid\" module allows you to size a pipe run for many different types of liquids (or fluids), pipe material and fitting types.\n\nThe \"HVAC Pipe Sizer - Steam\" module allows you to size a steam pipe run, and it also includes a bonus steam table calculator.\n\nThe \"HVAC Pipe Sizer - Gas Low and Gas High\" modules allows you to quickly size a simple low (less than or equal to 1.5 psi) and high (greater than 1.5 psi) pressure gas piping system by inputting a number of piping and gas properties.\n\nAll values can be displayed in English (IP) and Metric (SI) units.\n\nWe also offer all of the above modules as individual apps, too."

Then by clicking one of 8 buttons, each one of which represent a different paper category, the length of the roll is shown in feet.\n\nNote: The results are approximations, which could vary from actual roll lengths depending on winding tension, basis weight uniformity and moisture content."

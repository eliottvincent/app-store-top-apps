      "label": "The Liberty Item Entry App is designed to allow users of Resaleworld's popular Liberty software to enter and update inventory while on the go. Accounts can be added and updated as well. This app allows store employees to move to wherever they need to be with the convenience of a mobile device, while still having the ability access and enter information.This app helps improve productivity and helps to overcome a number of logistical challenges. The Item Entry App is ideal for the following scenarios: adding photographs to large amounts of new or existing inventory; adding large furniture which is difficult to relocate to a PC with a full installation of Liberty software; traveling to estate sales to add inventory; adding and updating inventory stored in a warehouse.\n\nThe item entry interface includes several design features that are optimized for a touch-screen, smaller display for popular mobile devices. A list of the 20 most commonly used categories speeds up item entry considerably. A graphical trend analysis tool calculates and displays pricing information based on the category and brand of the item being entered, based on the past year's sales data. Adding photographs to items is simple and quick both when using images from the device's photo library or when taking new pictures with the device's camera.  This app also allows users to print tags for inventory, to email item lists directly to accountholders, and to view an account's transaction history.\n\nThis app requires an installation Liberty Software (Liberty REACT, Liberty 5, Liberty 4 Consignment, or Liberty 4 Trading Assistants) and either a qualifying Web Service plan or a stand-alone Liberty Mobile Access license. Please contact Resaleworld with any questions about Liberty Mobile Access eligibility."

      "label": "This app offers four different calculations and shows the results both in a pane and on a psychrometric diagram:\r\n1. Air treatment\r\n   Calculates how to convert a given ambient air to a required design air. The steps involved are cooling with a given sensible heat factor, dehumidifying, heating and humidifying (adiabatic or steam). Depending on the given and required air conditions, some of these steps may not be needed.\r\n\r\n2. Capacities\r\n   Calculates the required capacity to cool down or heat up a given amount of air (e.g. air in your room).\r\n\r\n3. Heat exchanger\r\n   Calculates how warm room air heats up cool ambient air before supplying it as fresh air to the room. While heating up the ambient air, the heat exchanger cools down the room air, which may result in condensate. When the ambient air would be too cold, this calculation dimensions an electric heater to prevent condensate.\r\n\r\n4. Carburetor icing\r\n   Given a temperature and a dew point temperature, calculates the probability of icing in an airplane carburetor. Graphically shows the danger zones on a diagram.\r\n\r\nThese four calculations show the results in a pane, but also graphically in a diagram. You can choose between three different diagrams:\r\n1. Psychrometric\r\n   This is the classic diagram representing different kinds of air properties into a single diagram. You find detailed descriptions in standard books about air treatment, such as ASHRAE. This diagram shows lines of constant temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy and specific volume.\r\n\r\n2. Mollier\r\n   This is probably the oldest diagram to represent air properties and named after its inventor Richard Mollier (1863-1935). To get a psychrometrics diagram from a Mollier diagram, swap it along the vertical axis and rotate it 90°.\r\n   The Mollier diagram is heavily used in Eastern Europe and Germany and shows the same lines as in the psychrometrics diagram.\r\n\r\n3. Dewpoint\r\n   This diagram is meant for meteorologists and pilots. It is easy to read important weather data, such as temperature, dew point and relative humidity. However, this diagram shows the same constant lines as for the other two. Interestingly, the straight lines in the other two diagrams become curved lines in this one and vice versa.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n- Select two air properties to define a point: dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy, specific volume and moist air density.\r\n- No need for a keyboard. Enter data using buttons for small and large value increments.\r\n- Choose between metric or imperial unit dimensions, e.g. °C and °F or kW and BTU/h.\r\n- See immediate results of any change on the diagrams and the result panel shows detailed information about a point on the diagram.\r\n- Choose one of the diagram types (Psychrometrics, Mollier or Dewpoint) for the graphical results. Hide some constant lines on the selected diagram to simplify it. Define colors for the diagram lines and the background gradient.\r\n- Define the efficiency properties of a heat exchanger, giving you professional results.\r\n- Tap the explain tab to get a short explanation of a calculation or a diagram.\r\n- Zoom in (two fingers gesture) and pan (one finger gesture) to enlarge and move a part of the diagram.\r\n- The app saves your latest settings and starts up with those settings.\r\n- Supports five languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Dutch), which you can set in the preferences.\r\n- Supports light and dark themes."

Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

Profiles can be saved and edited and include state, marital status, pay period, allowances and deductions information.\n\n8 pre-tax or post-tax deductions\n-----------------------------------------\nPayrollguru app allows up to 8 pre-tax and/or post-tax deductions, which are setup as a fixed amount deduction or a % of gross pay. Deductions are customizable and can differ from one profile to another. The deductions can be modified to accommodate various taxing scenarios. For example for 401K deduction - select pretax and turn ON Federal and State switches to exclude it from being taxed on federal and state levels.\n\nOnce you enter all information and include year-to-date gross paid wages, Payroll Guru will calculate your net paycheck amount and will show you the appropraite taxes.\n\nPayroll Guru calculates the following taxes: \n- Federal WIthholding, \n- Social Security, \n- Medicare, \n- State Withholding, \n- State Unemployment (where applicable), \n- State Disability Insurance (where applicable). \n\nCalculated paychecks can be viewed as a pie chart showing the percentage distribution of your gross pay. Paycheck details can be emailed to an employee, employer or a payroll service provider. \n\nPayrollguru app is a must have for any self-employed person or employer in the US to calculate paychecks and verify accuracy of issued paychecks. \n\nPayrollguru app will also be useful to any employee looking to improve financial planning, budget spending and estimate impact of personal changes (i.e. marital status, number of dependents) on net take home amount. \n\nEmployees can also use Payroll Guru app to compare net paycheck amounts (after tax) in different states. This will be useful for employees considering job or relocation to a different state.  \n\nFor small business owners and payroll service providers Payrollguru will help estimate net and gross paycheck amounts in a particular payroll situation, and will provide a pretty accurate assessment of applicable payroll taxes.\n\nPayrollguru app calculates payroll taxes for all 50 states and District of Columbia. \n\nIf you have any improvement suggestions or would like to report a problem please email us directly at support@payrollguru.mobi. \n\nWe also appreciate your positive feedback and reviews. Thank you for using Payroll Guru app. Enjoy it!"

      "label": "SalesCalc is designed to help you to create irresistible deals\n- quickly \n- efficiently\n- accurately\nwithout having to remember formulas and equations\n\nAnyone can use it - it's really so simple.\nAll you need is an iPhone.\n\nIf you need to calculate:\n- Gross Margin\n- Markup %\n- Percent Change\n- Percent Total\nthen SalesCalc is the App for you. \n\n\nMost people in sales and purchasing rely on their favorite spreadsheets when they want to calculate margins, markups or discounts. Some folks have memorized the formulas and use a calculator for the task but we think that the iPhone presents an easier way to get the answers you need to close a deal quickly. Instead of having to remember formulas - you'll never make a mistake with SalesCalc.\n\nSalesCalc will deliver your answer in under a second, all you need to do is input numerical values into 2 of the 3 fields. To clear the fields, just shake the iPhone.\n\nSalesCalc puts a few of the most commonly used sales related calculations in the palm of your hand so the next time you are in deal making mode - reach out for SalesCalc and put together the best deal ever.\n\nHere's to your Sales Success... \n \n\nSome Definitions:\n- Gross Margin is the percentage of the selling price that can be applied toward covering your operating costs and profit. Basically, 20% gross profit margin means that for every dollar generated in sales, you have 20 cents left over to cover basic operating costs and profit. \nLarger gross margins are generally good for companies, with the exception of discount retailers which need to show that operation efficiency and financing allows them to operate with smaller margins. Since the Margin is the percentage of the price that is markup, it can never exceed 100%\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold includes variable and fixed costs directly linked to the product, such as material and labor. It does not include indirect fixed costs like office expenses, rent, administrative costs, etc.\n\n- Markup also known as Cost-Plus-Markup or Markup by Cost is the difference between the selling price and the cost divided by the cost of goods sold expressed as a percent. The initial markup of a retail product is also known as IMU. \n\n- Markdowns or Discounts are used to generate sales and or clear inventory and are usually expressed as a percentage of the Original Price.\n\n- Initial pricing is an extremely important step in merchandising. For retailers that use a traditional calculation, such as Keystoning, which is doubling cost to arrive at the selling price (100% IMU = 50% profit margin), this may or may not be adequate to be profitable, particularly after markdowns are taken. In reality, there are numerous examples of products that cannot be sold profitably, but need to be in the store to satisfy Customer needs. Therefore, other products need to be sold at higher MU%'s to cover the net losses of the products that lose money. SalesCalc gives you a few ways to price your products so that you can calculate your profitability using the method that best fits your business model."

      "label": "Noteflow is designed to replace pen and paper. It is a modern digital notebook that lets you get the most out of your iPad or iPhone.\n\nUse it for taking notes, annotating PDFs, sketching and doodling, plus a whole lot more:\n\nCopy and paste from the real world: Use Inkport gen 2 to snap a picture of a whiteboard or writing and convert it into Noteflow's native vector ink. No special paper needed. Then resize, re-color, or edit as if you wrote it in Noteflow.\n\nCreate layered drawings without layers: Use the highlighter tool to color and shade behind existing ink. Use Color-Select to separate and edit individual colors. It's a much more fluid and natural editing experience than with layers. Use the straight-line tool with a grid for fast and intuitive wireframes and drafting.\n\nDrag-and-drop, cloud-storage, and more: Noteflow natively integrates with iOS's file system and drag-and-drop capabilities. Drop photos and text into Noteflow, and drag your drawings into other apps. Store your files locally or sync with the cloud service of your choice. Make Noteflow a seamless part of your workflow, the way you like.\n\nSPACE FOR YOUR IDEAS TO ROAM\n\nOur vision for Noteflow is simple: to be digital pen and paper.\n\nThe magic of pen and paper is in their versatility. They are useful for so many things, but particularly for the freeform capture of ideas. Noteflow expands upon this quality.\n\nYou can naturally do all the things you normally do with pen and paper: take notes in meetings or class, and jot down flashes of inspirations on the go. And you can take that to a whole new level:\n\nOne of Noteflow’s best uses is for \"thinking on digital paper\": quickly capture key ideas and concepts, then move and organize them on the screen.\n\nNoteflow's vector ink engine lets you scale and edit your work without any loss of quality. Your words and drawings remain tack sharp when zoomed in, giving you a huge effective working canvas even on a single page.\n\nThere are analogues in the physical world, such as sketchnotes or everyday working on a white board, but being able to fluidly edit and move your ideas around the page is something you can only do digitally.\n\nWhen you represent the ideas in your head with your own personal scribbles on the screen, it effectively becomes an extension of your mind - giving you more room to think.\n\nWe've designed every part of Noteflow  to let you intuitively capture and work on your ideas the way you like. Whether it's dropping in existing information, quickly sketching concepts, or assembling polished presentations for others.\n\nBy resizing ink and zooming in, you have a huge effective canvas to work with, even on a single page.\n\nAs your ideas shape up, Noteflow has all the tools you need to tidy them up and format them to share with others.\n\nDIGITAL TOOLS FOR A DIGITAL AGE\n\nI hope you'll find Noteflow a useful part of your workflow, and that you'll discover new ways to do things with it that weren't easy before.\n\nWe're very proud of the work we've put into Noteflow, but we're also just seen the beginning of what's possible with powerful new digital platforms like the iPad.\n\nOur goal is to push these platforms to their limits to craft useful tools. Tools that can help us think a little more clearly, communicate a bit more effectively, and connect with other in new and enriching ways.\n\nThanks for joining us on this journey!\n\n-- The App Makers @ Qrayon."

No other app lets you so easily control your iPhone's most valuable data:\n\n1. Update, modify and maintain your contacts easily and conveniently on your computer using Excel, OpenOffice or any other Excel-compatible application.\n2. SA Contacts sends all of your contacts to you from your iPhone in a convenient zip file by email, USB, or through a webpage seen only on your local wifi network! Contact photos are sent, too!\n3. Never again rely on iTunes as your only local source of back up. Nor do you need to share your contacts with Yahoo or other websites in order to have a backup.  SA Contacts' zip file contains ALL of your contacts in a convenient, easy format.\n4. SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16. All column headers and labels in the Excel file are localized.\n17. Export/Import contacts to/from a VCF file.\n18. Backup contacts before import.\n19. Manage groups easily. You can now create, edit, delete groups and add contacts to groups.\n20. Export an Excel file with all photos included - this makes the contacts in your spreadsheet look better.\n21. Import your own file by mapping column headers to contact fields.\n22. Specify your own column headers in export process.\n\nMore detail and up-to-date help guides are available in samapp.com."

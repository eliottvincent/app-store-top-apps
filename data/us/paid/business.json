      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

      "label": "The ASHRAE HVAC Duct Sizer application allows you to quickly size one HVAC duct run or a range of duct sizes using the constant friction method. Think of this application as a digital version of the classic Trane Ductulator.\n \nIn the \"Size by Airflow\" mode, you can specify the total airflow in CFM (or L/s), the aspect ratio and one of either the velocity of air or the friction loss per 100 feet (30 meters). The results include both the exact and rounded height and width (or diameter) dimensions and the calculated velocity and friction loss.\n \nIn the \"Size by Dimensions\" mode, you can analyze an existing duct system. There are options to input the existing duct dimensions and one of either the airflow or velocity values to derive the calculated duct friction loss.\n \nIn the \"Range of Duct Sizes\" mode, you can specify minimum and maximum friction loss and airflow values to display a range of duct sizes that fall in between the friction loss bounds.\n \nYou can specify additional parameters such as the duct shape (rectangular, round, or oval), the air temperature and the air pressure. You can also choose to display values in either English (IP) or Metric (SI) units.\n \nThis application uses slider controls that allow you to quickly increment or decrement the input values and immediately observe the calculated results.\n \nThis app now works on your iPhone and iPad and adjusts its screen size accordingly.\n \nFinally, you can email all of the inputs and results from all 3 input modes to perform further analysis using your desktop computer. The email includes HTML text and a .CSV attachment that can be imported into any popular spreadsheet.\n \nThe ASHRAE HVAC Duct Sizer application was designed by Carmel Software Corporation for ASHRAE."

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

Accounts can be added and updated as well. This app allows store employees to move to wherever they need to be with the convenience of a mobile device, while still having the ability access and enter information.This app helps improve productivity and helps to overcome a number of logistical challenges. The Item Entry App is ideal for the following scenarios: adding photographs to large amounts of new or existing inventory; adding large furniture which is difficult to relocate to a PC with a full installation of Liberty software; traveling to estate sales to add inventory; adding and updating inventory stored in a warehouse.\n\nThe item entry interface includes several design features that are optimized for a touch-screen, smaller display for popular mobile devices. A list of the 20 most commonly used categories speeds up item entry considerably. A graphical trend analysis tool calculates and displays pricing information based on the category and brand of the item being entered, based on the past year's sales data. Adding photographs to items is simple and quick both when using images from the device's photo library or when taking new pictures with the device's camera.  This app also allows users to print tags for inventory, to email item lists directly to accountholders, and to view an account's transaction history.\n\nThis app requires an installation Liberty Software (Liberty REACT, Liberty 5, Liberty 4 Consignment, or Liberty 4 Trading Assistants) and either a qualifying Web Service plan or a stand-alone Liberty Mobile Access license. Please contact Resaleworld with any questions about Liberty Mobile Access eligibility."

      "label": "\"This productivity app is designed to allow copyright owners the ability to enforce their rights by the quick and easy creation of a legal Notification of Infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA Notice”). QuickDMCA permits copyright owners, or their agents, to expeditiously send DMCA Notices to ISP’s, hosts, billing processors, or other companies providing services to publishers of infringing content.  Under federal law, after receiving a DMCA Notice, the service provider is obligated to disable access to the content or cease providing services to the infringing material.  Repeat infringers must have their accounts permanently terminated.  QuickDMCA allows users to protect their valuable content from online piracy, at the touch of a button.  The application will allow the user to generate a DMCA Notice that contains all the necessary legal statements and information required by federal law, in minutes.  Copyright lawsuits can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to pursue, with no guaranty of result.  DMCA Notices can cause infringing content to be quickly removed from the Internet – often in a matter of days…or even hours!  Online service providers like hosts, third party billing processors, name servers, and payment gateways, must respond to DMCA Notices promptly, or risk becoming vicariously liable for infringement caused by their customers or subscribers.  QuickDMCA solves a common cyber-theft problem encountered by publishers of creative content such as pictures, videos, music, software, or graphics. Policing the unauthorized reproduction of your expressive works has never been easier, with QuickDMCA.  \n\nQuick DMCA™ allows you to:\n- Create a DMCA Notice containing all the required elements mandated by the DMCA, including:\n    Your contact information, email address, and website; \n    The name of the online service provider associated with the infringing content;\n    The location of the infringing content;\n    Sworn statements as to good faith belief of infringement; and,\n    The necessary electronic signature\n- Find the proper Designated Agent associated with specific online service providers\n- Execute the DMCA Notice on your touch screen, to capture your e-signature\n- Send the DMCA Notice directly from your mobile device to the company providing services to the infringer, in both plain text and       .pdf formats\n - Receive a copy of the transmitted DMCA Notice for your records\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., Internet attorney and inventor of the patented BirthDateVerifer™, the Quick2257® mobile app, and other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting DMCA Notices for the purpose of enforcing copyrights and taking down infringing material.  Anyone involved in the creation or publication of digital media can now quickly generate and send the necessary Notification of Infringement under federal law, using this simple mobile app.\n\nFor more information on DMCA copyright enforcement or other legal issues, please contact: http://www.firstamendment.com\n \n Note: Nothing contained on this site is intended as legal advice. Please consult with a competent copyright attorney for advice on proper use of this application and enforcement of intellectual property rights."

      "label": "This app offers four different calculations and shows the results both in a pane and on a psychrometric diagram:\r\n1. Air treatment\r\n   Calculates how to convert a given ambient air to a required design air. The steps involved are cooling with a given sensible heat factor, dehumidifying, heating and humidifying (adiabatic or steam). Depending on the given and required air conditions, some of these steps may not be needed.\r\n\r\n2. Capacities\r\n   Calculates the required capacity to cool down or heat up a given amount of air (e.g. air in your room).\r\n\r\n3. Heat exchanger\r\n   Calculates how warm room air heats up cool ambient air before supplying it as fresh air to the room. While heating up the ambient air, the heat exchanger cools down the room air, which may result in condensate. When the ambient air would be too cold, this calculation dimensions an electric heater to prevent condensate.\r\n\r\n4. Carburetor icing\r\n   Given a temperature and a dew point temperature, calculates the probability of icing in an airplane carburetor. Graphically shows the danger zones on a diagram.\r\n\r\nThese four calculations show the results in a pane, but also graphically in a diagram. You can choose between three different diagrams:\r\n1. Psychrometric\r\n   This is the classic diagram representing different kinds of air properties into a single diagram. You find detailed descriptions in standard books about air treatment, such as ASHRAE. This diagram shows lines of constant temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy and specific volume.\r\n\r\n2. Mollier\r\n   This is probably the oldest diagram to represent air properties and named after its inventor Richard Mollier (1863-1935). To get a psychrometrics diagram from a Mollier diagram, swap it along the vertical axis and rotate it 90°.\r\n   The Mollier diagram is heavily used in Eastern Europe and Germany and shows the same lines as in the psychrometrics diagram.\r\n\r\n3. Dewpoint\r\n   This diagram is meant for meteorologists and pilots. It is easy to read important weather data, such as temperature, dew point and relative humidity. However, this diagram shows the same constant lines as for the other two. Interestingly, the straight lines in the other two diagrams become curved lines in this one and vice versa.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n- Select two air properties to define a point: dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy, specific volume and moist air density.\r\n- No need for a keyboard. Enter data using buttons for small and large value increments.\r\n- Choose between metric or imperial unit dimensions, e.g. °C and °F or kW and BTU/h.\r\n- See immediate results of any change on the diagrams and the result panel shows detailed information about a point on the diagram.\r\n- Choose one of the diagram types (Psychrometrics, Mollier or Dewpoint) for the graphical results. Hide some constant lines on the selected diagram to simplify it. Define colors for the diagram lines and the background gradient.\r\n- Define the efficiency properties of a heat exchanger, giving you professional results.\r\n- Tap the explain tab to get a short explanation of a calculation or a diagram.\r\n- Zoom in (two fingers gesture) and pan (one finger gesture) to enlarge and move a part of the diagram.\r\n- The app saves your latest settings and starts up with those settings.\r\n- Supports five languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Dutch), which you can set in the preferences.\r\n- Supports light and dark themes."

The iOS mobile device connects to the XR-3 satellite meter using WiFi technology without using any 4G data and without going through the internet.\n\nApplication example: Connect your XR-3 satellite meter at the ground block location and power on the XR-3.  Then pair your XR-3 to your iOS mobile device via WiFi.  Climb the ladder with your phone on an armband, run the XR-3 Remote app, and check signal level and quality and re-align your satellite dish without having to first remove the LNBF head and temporarily connect short coax jumper cables from the LNBF to your satellite meter.  The XR-3 meter's screen is mirrored on your mobile device, allowing you to identify the satellite, toggle to different satellites and transponders and measure RF level, demodulated signal quality, and LNB LO drift.  This method offers safety and speed advantages for the satellite technician.\n\nPresent Limitations:\n1) Only works with XR-3 hardware version 3.01 (XR-3's with optional WiFi hardware module installed).  To confirm the hardware version of your XR-3, press MENU, select Versions from the Main Menu and refer to the Base HW Version field.

      "label": "Vibration Pro is a true vibration spectrum analyzer using the built in accelerometers and gyroscope inside the iPad, iPod Touch and the iPhone, the built in microphone or the Digiducer series of professional quality external USB accelerometers and USB input sensors ncluding the 333D01, 333D04, 633A01 and 435B39.  It acquires and displays time series data, and performs an FFT on each channel to produce frequency spectra.  The internal 3-channel accelerometer has a sensitivity of approximately 0.002g and a range of ±7.5g  and a frequency range from 0 - 50 Hz (0-3000 rpm) making the iPhone and iPod Touch and iPad sensitive enough to analyze the vibration of most moving machinery. For better sensitivity and a larger frequency range Vibration Pro can be used with external sensors which have sensitivity down to seismic levels and frequency ranges up to 24 kHz.\n\nIn many applications Vibration Pro can be an excellent portable alternative to a commercial spectrum analyzer.  In predictive maintenance applications Vibration Pro can help identify bearing defects, shaft misalignment, imbalance, and structural resonant frequencies.  Vibration Pro is also useful for monitoring the acceleration of part and material handling equipment.  \n\nThe software is flexible and easy to use.  It was written to emulate the familiar oscilloscope based spectrum analyzer.  Sample rate and sample delay are easily adjustable and the user can select the length of the data acquisition and the vertical scale used for the display.   When a test is complete the resulting data can be saved locally on your device or it can be emailed to your desktop computer for documentation purposes.\n\nThe scripting capability allows creation of complex scripts which can provide the technician with detailed instructions to guide them through multiple measurements.  All data is stored in a folder on the device which can easily be emailed or copied to a cloud service for analysis.  Scripting is available through an in-app auto renewing monthly subscription which can be renewed and cancelled at any time."

A low bid yields less profit but increases your chance of winning the job.\n\nSomewhere in the middle is the optimal bid that gives you the best chance of winning the job contract while making a nice profit.\n\nUsing the power of Monte Carlo Simulation this App considers the uncertainty around the number of bidders and their bid proposals in determining the bid you should make that maximizes your expected profit."

      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "I started off selling small handmade items on various sites.  Initially, I struggled with pricing.  How do you balance costs, while at the same time making a decent profit.  To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

      "label": "SalesCalc is designed to help you to create irresistible deals\n- quickly \n- efficiently\n- accurately\nwithout having to remember formulas and equations\n\nAnyone can use it - it's really so simple.\nAll you need is an iPhone.\n\nIf you need to calculate:\n- Gross Margin\n- Markup %\n- Percent Change\n- Percent Total\nthen SalesCalc is the App for you. \n\n\nMost people in sales and purchasing rely on their favorite spreadsheets when they want to calculate margins, markups or discounts. Some folks have memorized the formulas and use a calculator for the task but we think that the iPhone presents an easier way to get the answers you need to close a deal quickly. Instead of having to remember formulas - you'll never make a mistake with SalesCalc.\n\nSalesCalc will deliver your answer in under a second, all you need to do is input numerical values into 2 of the 3 fields. To clear the fields, just shake the iPhone.\n\nSalesCalc puts a few of the most commonly used sales related calculations in the palm of your hand so the next time you are in deal making mode - reach out for SalesCalc and put together the best deal ever.\n\nHere's to your Sales Success... \n \n\nSome Definitions:\n- Gross Margin is the percentage of the selling price that can be applied toward covering your operating costs and profit. Basically, 20% gross profit margin means that for every dollar generated in sales, you have 20 cents left over to cover basic operating costs and profit. \nLarger gross margins are generally good for companies, with the exception of discount retailers which need to show that operation efficiency and financing allows them to operate with smaller margins. Since the Margin is the percentage of the price that is markup, it can never exceed 100%\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold includes variable and fixed costs directly linked to the product, such as material and labor. It does not include indirect fixed costs like office expenses, rent, administrative costs, etc.\n\n- Markup also known as Cost-Plus-Markup or Markup by Cost is the difference between the selling price and the cost divided by the cost of goods sold expressed as a percent. The initial markup of a retail product is also known as IMU. \n\n- Markdowns or Discounts are used to generate sales and or clear inventory and are usually expressed as a percentage of the Original Price.\n\n- Initial pricing is an extremely important step in merchandising. For retailers that use a traditional calculation, such as Keystoning, which is doubling cost to arrive at the selling price (100% IMU = 50% profit margin), this may or may not be adequate to be profitable, particularly after markdowns are taken. In reality, there are numerous examples of products that cannot be sold profitably, but need to be in the store to satisfy Customer needs. Therefore, other products need to be sold at higher MU%'s to cover the net losses of the products that lose money. SalesCalc gives you a few ways to price your products so that you can calculate your profitability using the method that best fits your business model."

      "label": "The Liberty Item Entry App is designed to allow users of Resaleworld's popular Liberty software to enter and update inventory while on the go. Accounts can be added and updated as well. This app allows store employees to move to wherever they need to be with the convenience of a mobile device, while still having the ability access and enter information.This app helps improve productivity and helps to overcome a number of logistical challenges. The Item Entry App is ideal for the following scenarios: adding photographs to large amounts of new or existing inventory; adding large furniture which is difficult to relocate to a PC with a full installation of Liberty software; traveling to estate sales to add inventory; adding and updating inventory stored in a warehouse.\n\nThe item entry interface includes several design features that are optimized for a touch-screen, smaller display for popular mobile devices. A list of the 20 most commonly used categories speeds up item entry considerably. A graphical trend analysis tool calculates and displays pricing information based on the category and brand of the item being entered, based on the past year's sales data. Adding photographs to items is simple and quick both when using images from the device's photo library or when taking new pictures with the device's camera.  This app also allows users to print tags for inventory, to email item lists directly to accountholders, and to view an account's transaction history.\n\nThis app requires an installation Liberty Software (Liberty REACT, Liberty 5, Liberty 4 Consignment, or Liberty 4 Trading Assistants) and either a qualifying Web Service plan or a stand-alone Liberty Mobile Access license. Please contact Resaleworld with any questions about Liberty Mobile Access eligibility."

The PV/COLA calculator estimates the total Future Value (FV) / PV / COLA for a given percentage of disability between 70-100% based on Age at time of first payment, Date of Injury, and inputted PV discount rate / COLA inflation rate / PV Rate Discount Compound.\n- Additionally, the CompCalc Plus includes the option with a tap of the screen to turn on or off the Combined Value Equation when multiple rating strings are involved. When the Combined Value Equation is turned off the adjusted PD for each rating string is aggregated rather than combined using the Combined Value Equation.\n- It also includes a full PD rating schedule which automatically creates a rating string adjusting the WPI given the Part of Body, Age, Occupation, and DFEC. The Plus version also incorporates a relational database for Occupation and Part of Body making input intuitive and simple.\n- It has a Combined Vale Equation Module which computes CVE percentage and total indemnity given percentage numbers, DOI, AWW or PD Rate (defaulting to max). \n- The user has an option to override default TD/PD indemnity rate in all screens (always bounded by min and max values).\n- The user can print, store or send the e-mail of COLA calculations.\n\nThe CompCalc Plus includes a California Workers' Compensation Indemnity Calculator that calculates:\n- Permanent Disability.\n- Temporary Disability.\n- Life Pension.\n- Life Expectancy given the current age and based upon the 2008 / 2010 U.S. Life Tables as provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n- Supplemental Job Displacement Benefits.\n- and Death Benefits, for the given date of industrial injury.\n\nIt also calculates TD liability for a given period based on the default max weekly rate for the date of industrial injury or a TD rate based on AWW manually imputed.\n\nOther features also include a Date Calculator, full listing of QME/Body Codes, and full access to support and training videos.\n\nAll Users of the CompCalc are instructed to consult the specific provisions of the California Labor Code and/or the DEU to ensure the accuracy of the information provided.

Then pick the output unit unit and the radius, central angle, arc length, and circumference are instantly computed.\n\nDesigned for the multiple trades in the construction industry, this calculator is great for any craftsman who needs to find properties of a circle given curve measurements.  In particular, Radius Calculator is perfect carpenters or cabinet makers who deal with curved walls.\n\nNote: There is no closed form solution for the central angle and we use a common approximation for that calculation.  This method is very accurate for small angles and about 10% off on large angles approaching 180 degrees."

Press power button, you can see signal strength bar moving, then slide the thumb to set the threshold (0.00~1.00), the value will be saved for next time use. \n\n2.If the indicator start flashing, that means a real recording start. check the recorded files,some test files can be found  there . \n\n3.In each scenario, the threshold value could be different, set it according to the situation. For example,for snoring and dream talk recording at night, set the value to 0.05, but at daytime, you probably have to set it at 0.10. \n\n4. Attention for naming a label: all files can be saved to your computer. Label,as a part of a file name, has to follow some rules for different computer OS.For this app, make it simple as follows,the name length is better to be limited to within 125 characters,as for the kind of characters, for Windows,you can't use ?\\|/ etc. in your label, otherwise iTunes will report a error such as no files found, just rename it as windows' requirement to fix it.\n\n\n**About Volume**\nSpeaker mode or earphone mode,  the speaker hardware is shared by all apps in your device, please check both modes and adjust the volume if you can't hear anything.\n\n**How to download recording files**\nFor file downloading,  iTunes File sharing Feature is recommended.

Then, export the layout as an image, or as a CSV file.\n\nThe app supports multiple rack designs.\n\nRather than incorporating a vast symbol library, by allowing you to select the device icon from your device gallery, you can feature symbols, manufacturer logos or other appropriate images.\n\nDevice colours can be separated into industry standards, blue for audio, green for video, or be adjusted to suit your company brand colours.\n\nThe app is designed to provide rack layout only, and does not allow for connections to be shown between devices."

If you are servicing equipment the best way to begin diagnosis and determine the proper refrigerant charge is to use HVAC Buddy®, a set of gauges, and a thermometer.\n\n • Superheat for fixed capillary or Subcooling forTXV/EXV systems\n • Calculates targeted vs. actual Subcooling \n • Over 100 refrigerants including newer azeotropic blends\n • Airflow / Delta-T / TEET Calculation\n • Email System Status Report\n • Imperial (IP) or Metric (SI)\n • Use Target Superheat and Subcooling tables or enter manually\n • Update all values with realtime output\n • Line Chart displays historical values based on input changes or elapsed time\n\nIf the early outdoor temperature is 75F and you charge the system to a “beer can cold” suction line your system is likely improperly charged.  Later in the afternoon high temperatures will increase head pressure and the resulting overcharge means a lower than desired superheat and wasted energy.  Not good!\n\nOverall Process:\n\n • Enter refrigerant, temps, and pressures\n • The math is done for you to display Superheat, Subcooling and Airflow Target, Actual, and Difference\n • Email all readings (detail)\n\nOther Features:\n\n • Flexible units - psi, kPa, Fahrenheit, Celsius, etc.\n • Calculates Superheat and Subcooling targets\n • Airflow - For cooling, compares a targeted difference across the coil vs. actual.  Also called Delta-T or Target Evaporator Exit Temperature (TEET).\n • System Status Report - Use the email tab to create defaults for email addresses, subject, and System Status Report introductory text.  Tap the email button and these values are incorporated into a formatted page including all the parameters recorded in HVAC Buddy.   Edit the email and / or add contacts from your contact list.  Then on each service call it's just a couple taps to send a personalized report.\n\nAccolades and Awards:\n----------------------------\nHVAC Buddy® ranked #2 in ContractingBusiness.com readers choice of top 10 contracting apps.\n\nHVAC Buddy® was featured by the California Association of HERS Raters and is CalHERS approved!\n\n\"Very cool app.  I can see California really running with this as we have strict requirements for verification.\" - John Richau, Executive Director, Calhers\n\n\"an excellent programme\" - Charlie Richards\n\nHVAC Buddy® Load Calc - Now Available\n\nHVAC Buddy® Duct Calc - Powerful tool with a simple to use real-time interface to help you choose optimal duct sizes.\n\nHVAC Buddy® Pressure Temperature - Over 90 Refrigerant combinations and their corresponding PT relationship in Metric or Imperial units.\n\nHVAC Buddy® Psychrometric - Quickly calculate thermodynamic properties of moist air at temperatures commonly used in HVAC systems.

      "label": "Version 2.0 Available Now!!\nNow more handsomer, faster, and even more feature packed than ever (New Invoice Section*!).\n\nTimecard Pro is a multi-use app to keep track of your hours worked and your work schedule. It's great for freelance workers, employers to track their employees, or for anyone who wants to see a live view of how much money they're earning. The possibilities of utilizing the app are endless.\n\nSimply add your Job(s) or employees, and then clock in and out whenever needed. At the end of your pay period, you can export your timecards and email a report to your boss or client. Need to clock into multiple jobs, and have a different hourly rate for each? Not a problem, Timecard Pro can handle all of this, without breaking a sweat.\n\n----------------------------------------- \n\nWhat our users are saying: \n\n\"I love it...Life is easy now\" \n\n\"Top Notch, Solid, & Reliable...Click & Forget\" \n\n\"Design and Navigation Success!\" \n\n----------------------------------------- \n\n\nUniversal application: Purchase once, use on both your iPhone and iPad.\n\nFeatures: \n- Easy to use, intuitive interface.

Protect each user data with a password lock.\n- Reports page lets you export multiple Pay Periods, regardless of job, all in the same email with Text, CSV, and PDF export options.\n- 2 Data Backup options, including Email Export, and a built-in 'Restore Data' section.\n- Main display shows money earned, clocked-in time, and how many hours you've worked.\n- Use the menu button on the homepage, to quickly select the job/employee you need to clock into.\n- Clock into multiple jobs/employees at the same time.\n- Icon badge indicator shows how many jobs you're currently clocked into without having to open the app.\n- Set up a different hourly rate for each job.\n- Calculate both daily and weekly overtime hours at the same time.\n- Remain clocked in, even if you turn your phone off!

A beautifully designed invoice will be created, in which a PDF version can be emailed, printed, saved to your Dropbox, or shared.\n\n\nNote to Employers: \nEmployers can add Employees under the \"Jobs\" page instead of entering job names. You can then use the menu from the Home Page to select your employee once they arrive at work, just like a 'job'.

This is more than what is available on the FEMA site; it automatically completes the SFHDF form including the Community and map panel information, and provides a map showing the property with the FEMA / NFIP overlay!\n\nFLOOD ZONE quickly and easily gives you the FEMA designated flood zone of your current location or a point you choose on a map. Real estate agents, insurance agents, GIS professionals, surveyors, landowners and anyone with an interest in flood related products or services will find this app's subscription service easy, quick and very affordable. \n\nRealtors and Real estate agents: Add value to the service you provide. Top agents are knowledgeable of flood zones. Areas with a significant risk of flooding can be located miles away from bodies of water or rivers, and lender-required flood insurance can put a reasonably priced home out of the reach of some buyers. Use FLOOD ZONE to identify these properties and save yourself and buyers time and frustration. Listing agents and sellers can benefit too. Purchasers need to know that increases in flood insurance premiums are affected by a property’s flood zone. The FLOOD ZONE app helps listing agents and sellers determine what they need to disclose when placing a home on the market. \n\nHome Owners: FLOOD ZONE can help you monitor if your property’s flood zone has changed because of flood map redrawing. Are you near the boundary of two different zones? Use FLOOD ZONE to see how close you are to higher risk. \n\nFLOOD ZONE shows FEMA approved flood hazard maps using National Flood Insurance Program data that is updated regularly. FLOOD ZONE is an informational tool and not a substitute for an elevation certificate performed by a qualified professional. Data is believed accurate but not guaranteed.

With 5 presets, you can easily go save and return to settings you love. The app features two knobs for tuning needle height and frequency and makes extremely precise fine-tuning a cake walk. This version has three wave forms to choose from; The Shark Tooth wave is the first audio wave specifically designed for tattooing. The Hammer Head is a modified square wave with an initial spike in power. It is just that, the Hammer! It is the wave of choice for fat lines and colour packing. It is also the best so far for frequencies below 60 Hz, as it has a very dramatic negative pulse. The Jaws wave is a modified sine wave with an increased initial slope. This wave is the butter wave. Nice and soft and a great starter wave for anyone using the machine for the first time.\n\nVoice commands include; weasel on, weasel off, weasel DC, weasel  AC, weasel shark tooth, weasel hammerhead, weasel jaws, weasel 1, weasel 2, weasel 3, weasel 4, weasel 5 (for presets). It uses some power and works offline. Switch it ON or OFF using mic icon (or \"weasel microphone off\" while ON) Instead of \"weasel\" you can also call your machine using \"hey machine\" or \"ink weasel\" or \"electric shark\" followed by any of the above commands.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nElectric Shark products and services are aimed at professional tattoo artists who are fully aware of all legal requirements including sterilisation techniques and effective disposal of Sharps and Soft Wastes.

      "label": "A Bíblia King James de 1611 é descrita como uma das publicações mais importantes da história, e também a mais fiel ao Textus Receptus. O rei James I da Inglaterra reuniu os maiores estudiosos religiosos e linguistas para uma nova tradução da Bíblia, a fim de estabelecer a tradução mais precisa e mais digna até à data. Ele nomeou 54 estudiosos para trabalhar na tradução, e 47 trabalharam em seis grupos em três locais por sete anos.\r\n\r\nApós a conclusão, a Bíblia King James foi impressa pela primeira vez em 1611 por Robert Barker. A Bíblia era muito grande, cerca de 40cm de altura. Por causa do alto custo e valor, foi anunciado para as igrejas que a Bíblia devia ser acorrentada nos púlpitos.\r\n\r\nA Bíblia 1611 foi autorizada para ser lida nas igrejas, razão pela qual foi chamada de Versão Autorizada. Enfim, nós da BV Books estamos felizes em poder apresentar, a Versão Autorizada em português da Bíblia King James."

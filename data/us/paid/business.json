      "label": "A must have for Professional Snow Plowers!  Plus it keeps getting better with each update!  Get the edge over your competition.\n\nHow long do you have to snow plow to pay for this app?  Minutes!  Think of it as less than the cost of (2) bags of ice melt or roughly 5% of a new cutting edge on your plow .  Think of it as the cheapest thing you will buy for your snow removal business besides the snacks at the gas station.  \n\nRead everything below to understand why it's worth purchasing....\n\nSnowClient was created by someone that has been in your shoes (snow boots), snow plowing through the night to have the properties clear by morning.\n\nThink about it!  No more clipboards, paper, and handwriting.  Handwriting that is hard to read and takes forever to organize to be able to invoice snow customers after the snow storm is over.  All the while you are hoping that your paperwork notes don't blow away, fall in the snow, or get stolen.  Then how are you supposed to know what hours to bill for and all the other information that was on that piece of paper?  The SnowClient app takes care of all of this.  \n\nWith SnowClient it is easy to document all the work you do and have it immediately organized and accessible in case your snow removal clients want to know when you serviced their property or how deep the snow was when you did service it.  You will have the info at your fingertips and will impress them with your ability to know the facts on the spot.\n\nNo more hours spent calculating your hours for each property to know what to put on the invoice.  It is done the moment you finish servicing the snow account and push stop.\n\nThen when invoicing, all you do is use the sort feature to filter by property and you have all the information you need to invoice for that specific property!\n\nYou can also sort by date and team leader (this could be the driver).\n\nAlso if you put the full address into the property info you or your employees can just click on it to get directions to that property.\n\nSimplify your snow business and minimize the headaches & work after the snow storm.   \n\nSnowClient Helps You Keep Track of:\n\n- Property Names\n\n- Property Details (Address, Deadline Time, Etc.)\n\n- Time Spent Working at Each Property\n\n- Employee Information (if needed)\n\n- Amounts of Salt or De-icing Materials Used at Each Property to be Billed for Later\n\n- Additional Notes - Write Notes and Other Messages That Are Unique to Your Company's Way of Doing Business or Other Information You Would Like but There is no Spot For it.\n\n- Which Employees Serviced Which Properties\n(Employees on the job)\n\nSnowClient Also Will:\n\n- Assist in Accurate Billing\n\n- Keep Work Information Organized\n\n- Create Documentation to Help in Legal Matters\n\n- And So Much More in the Future!\n\n***What this app does NOT do:\n\n- Store Your Information in the Cloud (all the info is stored on your phone)\n\n- Login for Different Users or Privileges\n\n- Sync Information Across Different Users Devices \n\n- Export to Excel or Quickbooks BUT there IS exporting (text, email, etc.)\n\n- Print (unless you export to notes then you can print from notes)\n\nWe know there are probably a lot more features including the ones listed under \"What this app is not\" that you would like to be able to have to help you manage your snow removal properties, snow removal employees, and snow removal customers.  \n\nPLEASE share your ideas with us so we can incorporate them into the app to better serve your needs.  We want to make sure you are satisfied!  We would like to see all 5 Star Reviews so help us out and give us feedback before slamming us with a bad review.  If your life is better because of this app then give us a good review:)  As snow plowers we know what it is like to only hear complaints and on the other side how good it feels when somebody appreciates the work we performed.\n\nSend us a message on our Facebook page by following the Support Link.  We are here for you!"

      "label": "The Hidden Secrets to Profitability That Most Business Consultants Don't Want You To Know Are Just A Click Away.\r\n\r\n“If You Want To Grow Your Business Even Faster, This Little App Is Like Helium For A Balloon.”\r\n\r\n“We frequently need to price our products to sell well. Break-Even Analysis is one way to be sure that you are on the right track before you make a costly mistake.”\r\n\r\nB/E Analysis helps you to predict the sales volume required to reach your break-even point where your total cost equals your total revenue.  \r\n\r\nThe App goes one step further and suggests ways to help you increase your profits using your own input as a guide.\r\n\r\nIn 20 Seconds or Less You Can Now Get A Break-Even Analysis Done On Your iPhone!\r\n\r\nYes, Any Product, Any Service and Any Business - Even iPhone Development Projects Can Benefit From This App.\r\n\r\nAll you need to start are 4 basic numerical inputs and the desire to increase your bottom line profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO IS THIS APP FOR:\r\n- Small & Medium Sized Business Owners and Managers\r\n- Corporate Managers That Want A Quick Tool To Guide Them To Higher Profits\r\n- Shareholders, Stakeholders & Entrepreneurs\r\n\r\n\"I used it and decided to go with a 4% price increase. Customers didn’t even notice, my sales numbers stayed the same and it looks like this thing helped me to double my profits. I am blown away”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WILL THIS APP DO FOR YOU:\r\nBreak-Even Analysis is a report NOT normally produced by your accountant, nor is it automatically generated by most accounting software.\r\n\r\nRecent massive layoffs at large corporations are the direct result of an attempt to lower the break-even point of the target business to stay competitive, remain in business and try to increase profits at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf you run a business or a business division and you like to put more money into your pocket, knowing the Break-Even Point for any given product (or project) immediately tells you the lowest amount of business activity necessary to prevent losses. Armed with this information you can tweak your business to get more out of it.\r\n\r\nDo you know your business's Break-Even Point?\r\nWhat about the B/E Point for each of the products you sell?\r\n\r\n\r\nIS IT COMPLICATED:\r\nWe spent months breaking the process down into its core components and then building it back up again as an easy to use business tool. A group of young entrepreneurs gave us feedback after 60 days of using the tool before we went back to our developers and improved it all over again. Now it's your turn, take the App for a spin, use it in your business and let us know what you have achieved.\r\n\r\nAll you need to get going are four things: \r\n-\tThe cost to produce one unit of your product\r\n-\tYour Fixed Costs like rent, utilities and salaries\r\n-\tYour Sales Forecast for a given period and \r\n-\tYour Selling Price for the product\r\n\r\nHere's what a few of our Customers had to say about Break-Even Analysis.\r\n\r\n\"For an iPhone application, this thing is pricey but if you're in business, you'll probably figure out how to earn more money by using it just once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Breakeven is a no-brainer. Used properly, it'll help your business. Thanks again for the free bonus\"\r\n\r\n\"Knowing the elements of break-even analysis focused me on managing the costs that maximize our bottom line.  We definitely make more money today.\"\r\n\r\n“This little App works beautifully with the Apple iTunes Store rev share model. I love what you did with Sales Calc and Break-Even is even better - keep it coming”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS INCLUDED:\r\nIf you enter the 4 input variables, and hit the calculate button, your results are displayed immediately for you in the lower half of the screen. If you were to tap on the Profit or Loss text, a few helpful suggestions are displayed – all designed to improve your bottom line. To view your B/E point on a chart, be sure you have internet access and then turn the iPhone sideways.\r\n\r\nInstructions, definitions & explanations are all included in the Info area of the App."

      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

You can search documents by name easily in the app.\n\nBy turning on the auto file sync with iCloud Drive, you can easily access your scanned documents from any other device.\nBy turning on WiFi file sharing, you can read all PDF files on the device.\n\nYou can also email documents out as PDF or JPEG files.\nExport OCR result as txt or docx file.\n\nOther ways to import / export documents: \n- Fax documents to over 100 countries instantly (cost calculated by the number of pages and recipient country and paid via in-app purchase).\n- Transfer all your documents from one device to another.\n- Support import / upload to SMB (Win / Mac / NAS).\n- Support import / upload to iCloud Drive.\n- Support import / upload to Dropbox.\n- Support import / upload to Google Drive.\n- Support import / upload to Box.\n- Support import / upload to SkyDrive.\n- Support import / upload to WebDAV Server.\n- Print documents via AirPrint.  \n- Save documents to Photo Albums. \n- \"Open In\" other apps, e.g. iBooks, Kindle, Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nImport Files: \n- Import PDFs via \"Open In\" from other apps.\n- Import PDF/JPEG from cloud storages.\n\nFax:\n- In-app fax sending and receiving is convenient especially when you are out of office or have no fax machine at all. \n- Receive a push notification when a fax is sent or received succesffuly or failed for what reason.\n- Receive faxes with non auto renewable subscription which supports dozens of countries (we kept adding more) for users to subscribe a fax number for receiving faxes.\n- Deny all faxes when no need to receive any fax.\n\nTip: For best edge detection, please place your documents in high contrast to the background, e.g. put your white paper on a dark table. \n\nYour feedbacks are very important to us. \nPlease contact our customer service at support@ifunplay.com for resolving problems before submitting feedback in appstore. Most problems can be solved easily, but we cannot help you solve problems from the comments."

Here is how it works:  Science tells us that 95-99% of our behaviours are operated by our subconscious mind.  Therefore, the #1 Key to Sales Excellence is discovering and kicking out from your subconscious mind negative thoughts such as:\n \n“I don’t have enough confidence in myself.”\n\n“I don’t have enough support for my job.”\n\n“I hate cold calling.”\n\n“The competition’s salespeople are better than I am”\n\n Imagine thinking the opposite!

      "label": "Launch your discreet, skillful campaign for power at work: immediately.\n\n“Foundations” is the first in a series of apps that provide discreet, on-the-job training in the Arts of Power: how to acquire, maintain, and expand your power in the workplace. It is based on the New York Times best-selling book, The 48 Laws of Power, by Robert Greene.\n\n**Thousands of successful users from around the world since June 2011**\n\nThis system does not provide you with sugar-coated, politically correct sayings and exercises. Nor does it offer the ubiquitous “secret-formula” for rapid success still used by charlatans to this day.\n\nReal, lasting power is gained by seeing the world clearly (no matter how ugly some of it may be), and by playing the game of power: subtly, skillfully, and in a way that reflects your own uniqueness.\n\nPlay this social game wisely, and not only will you maximize your power, you will do so in a way that is fun AND profoundly reflects who you are.\n\nRemember: power isn’t the problem, powerlessness is.\n\nCONTENTS\nThe Foundations app utilizes:\n- 25 audio sessions + 5 Bonus sessions (approx. 15 min. each, 9hrs in total)\n- 4 Integrated Tools (always accessible)\n- A member’s web site (for home use)\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nIdeally, listen to one audio session on the way to work, as a morning briefing for your day ahead.\n\nWhile you listen, you are given the opportunity to reflect on how various portions of Greene’s text (plus real-world business examples) relate to your situation. Each session ends with a suggested action designed to help you discreetly and skillfully enhance your power that day at work. \n\nEach session also brings you closer to revealing and strengthening the Foundations of your power: the powerful skills, behaviours and perspectives you already have to some degree. Refine these, and it not only increases your power immediately at work, it also gives you the solid base you need to add power-enhancing capabilities that are new to you.\n\nDuring the day you record any observations or planned actions within the four integrated tools.\n\nThe four tools are: \n1) REFLECTOR: Self Assessment\n2) DOSSIER: Analyzing the people you work with\n3) STRATEGY: Your plans to enhance your power\n4) PERSONA: A vision of the most powerful - and sustainable - aspects of your character that you should present to the world\n\nAs you complete each audio session, a new element is released within one of the tools to help you quickly record your observations and strategies.\n\nBy the time you finish the primary 25 sessions, the observations you have made, and strategies you have designed in the four tools, guide you along your own, unique pathway to mastery. Listen to the sessions again and again, or just keep refining and adding to what you’ve entered within the tools.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO OUR V1.X USERS:\nRobert Greene has been following the development and testing of this unique mastery system over the years. It was directly through the insightful feedback from our first generation users - and the endlessly practical wisdom of Greene’s work - that the 5 new bonus sessions 26-30 came to be. \n\nWARNING! Action-based program\nPursuing mastery requires taking real-world action: however since AMS cannot know your exact situation, this app provides you with suggested actions.  These actions are specific enough to be understood, but must be adapted to fit your unique disposition and situation. Therefore, we cannot know what form your final actions will take or be responsible for any consequences.\n\nRest assured however, Mastering The 48 Laws of Power is all about taking wise, subtle action."

Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12.

      "label": "A Bíblia King James de 1611 é descrita como uma das publicações mais importantes da história, e também a mais fiel ao Textus Receptus. O rei James I da Inglaterra reuniu os maiores estudiosos religiosos e linguistas para uma nova tradução da Bíblia, a fim de estabelecer a tradução mais precisa e mais digna até à data. Ele nomeou 54 estudiosos para trabalhar na tradução, e 47 trabalharam em seis grupos em três locais por sete anos.\r\n\r\nApós a conclusão, a Bíblia King James foi impressa pela primeira vez em 1611 por Robert Barker. A Bíblia era muito grande, cerca de 40cm de altura. Por causa do alto custo e valor, foi anunciado para as igrejas que a Bíblia devia ser acorrentada nos púlpitos.\r\n\r\nA Bíblia 1611 foi autorizada para ser lida nas igrejas, razão pela qual foi chamada de Versão Autorizada. Enfim, nós da BV Books estamos felizes em poder apresentar, a Versão Autorizada em português da Bíblia King James."

      "label": "The SmartMouth App is an interactive public speaking tool that simplifies speechwriting and presentation prep. The app provides an in-depth “how to” discourse that breaks down the parts of a speech, as well as an easy-to-use speechwriting template with step-by-step prompts. The app was designed to help anyone who needs to get up in front of a group and talk. It helps create speeches and presentations that are easy for the speaker to deliver and easy for the audience to follow (which, most would agree, is a true innovation!). It is also helpful to anyone preparing for leading or contributing to a meeting.\n\nThe app leverages technology to bring SmartMouth’s proprietary public speaking methodology to more people than SmartMouth, or any consultancy, could possibly reach through its coaching and training practice. In addition to the “How To” content that walks users through the parts of a speech, this app also offers “Journal” entry space for notes to self, which might include a personal introduction, ideas for future topics, observations of other speakers, or stories and anecdotes. The big functionality attraction is the speechwriting tool. In the \"Speeches\" section, users follow prompts to create a detailed outline for a speech or presentation. Once the outline is created in the app, it can be saved (archived for future reference), duplicated (and adapted for another talk), and/or emailed (so the user can work on it or add visuals from their desktop or laptop). There is space to store feedback – e.g. what worked and what didn't work – for each speech or presentation.\n\nThis app is available for iPhone and iPad."

Press power button, you can see signal strength bar moving, then slide the thumb to set the threshold (0.00~1.00), the value will be saved for next time use. \n\n2.If the indicator start flashing, that means a real recording start. check the recorded files,some test files can be found  there . \n\n3.In each scenario, the threshold value could be different, set it according to the situation. For example,for snoring and dream talk recording at night, set the value to 0.05, but at daytime, you probably have to set it at 0.10. \n\n4. Attention for naming a label: all files can be saved to your computer. Label,as a part of a file name, has to follow some rules for different computer OS.For this app, make it simple as follows,the name length is better to be limited to within 125 characters,as for the kind of characters, for Windows,you can't use ?\\|/ etc. in your label, otherwise iTunes will report a error such as no files found, just rename it as windows' requirement to fix it.\n\n\n**About Volume**\nSpeaker mode or earphone mode,  the speaker hardware is shared by all apps in your device, please check both modes and adjust the volume if you can't hear anything.\n\n**How to download recording files**\nFor file downloading,  iTunes File sharing Feature is recommended.

The date and start odometer are entered automatically.\n \nThere are no pretty graphs, fancy reports or a multitude of settings, just simple, quick entries.\n \nAll entries can be exported to a CSV file for manipulation (graphs and wiz-bang formulas) in a spreadsheet.\n\nFeatures details:\n- Add entries for each trip including distance, places, reasons and general notes.\n- 1 to 3 taps for a new entry\n- Include start and end times, if required\n- Export to CSV\n- PDF by month, last month, last 3 months, last year, or all\n- Email CSV and PDF\n- Popup monthly summaries"

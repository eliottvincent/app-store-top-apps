Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

Give your rack a name, set it's height in U and populate the 19\" rack with your devices.\n\n2. Quickly create a library of devices, choosing title, colour and icon. Swipe left on an existing device in your library to edit its properties.\n\n3. Devices can be deleted, edited and moved around within the rack until your rack design is finalised.\n\n4. Then, export the layout as an image, or as a CSV file.\n\nThe app supports multiple rack designs.\n\nRather than incorporating a vast symbol library, by allowing you to select the device icon from your device gallery, you can feature symbols, manufacturer logos or other appropriate images.\n\nDevice colours can be separated into industry standards, blue for audio, green for video, or be adjusted to suit your company brand colours.\n\nThe app is designed to provide rack layout only, and does not allow for connections to be shown between devices."

This data is encoded in a PDF417 barcode on the back, which can be read using the DL  PDF417 barcode scanner. \n\nThe app allows to input, verify and encode AAMVA ID/DL user data in  the PDF417 driver's license barcode and ID barcode.The application contains all standard AAMVA elements and validation rules. Just provide user specifis details and get the valid PDF417 ID barcode. The pdf417 two dimensional bar code symbology is the minimum mandatory machine-readable technology that must be present on compliant DL/ID documents.\nThe PDF417 symbology (see ISO/IEC 15438 Automatic Identification and Data Capture Techniques - International Two-dimensional Symbology Specification - PDF417) shall be used for the Driver License applications. \nThe symbology characteristics shall conform to ISO/IEC 15438. \nThe bar code area shall be located in Zone V of the DL/ID document. The maximum width of the pdf417 symbol shall be 75,565 mm (2.975”). The maximum height of the PDF417 symbol shall be 38,1 mm (1.50”). \nAll compliant 2D symbols shall employ a file header that allows interested parties to interpret the encoded data. Subfiles shall be employed to carry the specific information. The combination of a header and one or more subfile designators shall make up a compliant 2D symbol. \nWorks om iPhone, iPad and Mac."

You can search documents by name easily in the app.\n\nBy turning on the auto file sync with iCloud Drive, you can easily access your scanned documents from any other device.\nBy turning on WiFi file sharing, you can read all PDF files on the device.\n\nYou can also email documents out as PDF or JPEG files.\nExport OCR result as txt or docx file.\n\nOther ways to import / export documents: \n- Fax documents to over 100 countries instantly (cost calculated by the number of pages and recipient country and paid via in-app purchase).\n- Transfer all your documents from one device to another.\n- Support import / upload to SMB (Win / Mac / NAS).\n- Support import / upload to iCloud Drive.\n- Support import / upload to Dropbox.\n- Support import / upload to Google Drive.\n- Support import / upload to Box.\n- Support import / upload to SkyDrive.\n- Support import / upload to WebDAV Server.\n- Print documents via AirPrint.  \n- Save documents to Photo Albums. \n- \"Open In\" other apps, e.g. iBooks, Kindle, Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nImport Files: \n- Import PDFs via \"Open In\" from other apps.\n- Import PDF/JPEG from cloud storages.\n\nFax:\n- In-app fax sending and receiving is convenient especially when you are out of office or have no fax machine at all. \n- Receive a push notification when a fax is sent or received succesffuly or failed for what reason.\n- Receive faxes with non auto renewable subscription which supports dozens of countries (we kept adding more) for users to subscribe a fax number for receiving faxes.\n- Deny all faxes when no need to receive any fax.\n\nTip: For best edge detection, please place your documents in high contrast to the background, e.g. put your white paper on a dark table. \n\nYour feedbacks are very important to us. \nPlease contact our customer service at support@ifunplay.com for resolving problems before submitting feedback in appstore.

      "label": "Specifically designed to give the user unlimited machine control power with the touch of a screen or voice commands. With 5 presets, you can easily go save and return to settings you love. The app features two knobs for tuning needle height and frequency and makes extremely precise fine-tuning a cake walk. This version has three wave forms to choose from; The Shark Tooth wave is the first audio wave specifically designed for tattooing. The Hammer Head is a modified square wave with an initial spike in power. It is just that, the Hammer! It is the wave of choice for fat lines and colour packing. It is also the best so far for frequencies below 60 Hz, as it has a very dramatic negative pulse. The Jaws wave is a modified sine wave with an increased initial slope. This wave is the butter wave. Nice and soft and a great starter wave for anyone using the machine for the first time.\n\nVoice commands include; weasel on, weasel off, weasel DC, weasel  AC, weasel shark tooth, weasel hammerhead, weasel jaws, weasel 1, weasel 2, weasel 3, weasel 4, weasel 5 (for presets). It uses some power and works offline. Switch it ON or OFF using mic icon (or \"weasel microphone off\" while ON) Instead of \"weasel\" you can also call your machine using \"hey machine\" or \"ink weasel\" or \"electric shark\" followed by any of the above commands.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nElectric Shark products and services are aimed at professional tattoo artists who are fully aware of all legal requirements including sterilisation techniques and effective disposal of Sharps and Soft Wastes.

      "label": "Create the Standard Flood Hazard Determination Form (SFHDF) right on your iPad and iPhone. This is more than what is available on the FEMA site; it automatically completes the SFHDF form including the Community and map panel information, and provides a map showing the property with the FEMA / NFIP overlay!\n\nFLOOD ZONE quickly and easily gives you the FEMA designated flood zone of your current location or a point you choose on a map. Real estate agents, insurance agents, GIS professionals, surveyors, landowners and anyone with an interest in flood related products or services will find this app's subscription service easy, quick and very affordable. \n\nRealtors and Real estate agents: Add value to the service you provide. Top agents are knowledgeable of flood zones. Areas with a significant risk of flooding can be located miles away from bodies of water or rivers, and lender-required flood insurance can put a reasonably priced home out of the reach of some buyers. Use FLOOD ZONE to identify these properties and save yourself and buyers time and frustration. Listing agents and sellers can benefit too. Purchasers need to know that increases in flood insurance premiums are affected by a property’s flood zone. The FLOOD ZONE app helps listing agents and sellers determine what they need to disclose when placing a home on the market. \n\nHome Owners: FLOOD ZONE can help you monitor if your property’s flood zone has changed because of flood map redrawing. Are you near the boundary of two different zones? Use FLOOD ZONE to see how close you are to higher risk. \n\nFLOOD ZONE shows FEMA approved flood hazard maps using National Flood Insurance Program data that is updated regularly. FLOOD ZONE is an informational tool and not a substitute for an elevation certificate performed by a qualified professional. Data is believed accurate but not guaranteed. This app is NOT an official NFIP or FEMA publication. Please refer to official FEMA and NFIP resources and appropriately qualified professionals for all related determinations.\n\nYou can customize the map to hide or show FIRM Panels, Flood Hazard Zones, LOMRs, LOMAs, River Mile Markers, Coastal Gages, Base Flood Elevations, Water Lines, Coastal Barrier Resources System Area, and Levees.\n\nThe app REQUIRES an auto-renew subscription to the online flood zone maps, offered as an in-app purchase. The app comes with a free trial of access to the flood zone maps before you have to buy anything.\n\nThere is an OPTIONAL auto-renew subscription to create Flood Hazard Determination PDF documents, offered as an in-app purchase. \n\nDiscounts may be provided for longer subscription periods. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user here: https://goo.gl/8gknaa\n\nSubscription auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\nhttp://www.ikonetics.com/app-site-terms-privacy.html"

Check out our other apps to find it.\n\nKiosker is the most straightforward way to transform any iOS device into a full screen web kiosk. Built on the same web engine that Safari uses, Kiosker can be used to display websites, PDFs, images, videos, and documents. Use Kiosker to attract your customers with a digital newsletter signup kiosk or an interactive product guide. Do you own a smart home hub with a web control panel? Then Kiosker is your top choice for setting up an on-wall control center. Kiosker can even help you to test your students’ knowledge by giving them secure digital exams. We are sure that Kiosker can be used in many more ways than we ever can think of, and we are really curious to see what you can make out of our application.\n\nAll of the functionality you expect from a modern browser is built right into the app. This includes user-friendly settings management, a togglable clean navigation bar with Google-search built-in, a menu overlay for easy access to the main functions, and more. We also include several ways to handle the notch on newer iPhones, which could otherwise be annoying when viewing fullscreen content on those devices.\n\nControl the user experience by\n• Adding a start URL as the starting point of the kiosk. This could be a place on the internet or a local resource.\n• Defining favorites for easy navigation to the most used websites.\n• Limiting the accessible domains.\n• Hiding or showing the navigation and status bars.\n• Locking the device to a specified orientation.\n• Displaying an on-screen menu that lets you navigate and control Kiosker. \n• Restricting the user from interacting with the page in various ways, including scrolling, zooming, selecting, etc.\n• Setting time limits for automatic reload, browsing time, and return to home when idle.\n• Showing a screensaver at a configured time, when the kiosk is unused or when dark mode is enabled.\n• Set up the screensaver as a slideshow.\n• Exiting the screensaver with motion detection (requires iOS 13 or later) or with a tap.\n• Extending the experience by paring a physical flic Bluetooth button.\n• Interacting with Kiosker using JavaScript.\n• Sharing your configuration with other devices.\n• Locking the device to Kiosker using guided access, single app mode, or autonomous single app mode.\n\nVisit our website for a full feature list.\n\nKiosker requires iOS 11 or later.\n\nDon't hesitate to contact us if you have come up with a feature that we haven't thought of or if you have found a bug."

The stunning 3D robot can chat with you, answer detailed questions and can guide and help you. \n\nThe knowledge base behind the app contains 'Wolfram Alpha', which gives you an enormous amount of information in your pocket. \nWith Voice Answer, you have full and unlimited access to this knowledge. \n\nExamples of topics and specific questions and commands: \n\nText: 'Send text to George I will be late' \n\nEmail: 'Email John Let's get together this week.' \n\nCall: 'Call mom' \n\nTranslation: 'Translate I would like to go now into Spanish' \n\nPlay songs on your device: 'Play music by Adele' \n\nReminder: 'Set reminder to 5 pm' \n\nSocial media: 'Post to Facebook This is great', 'Tweet I am going home now' \n\nSearch: 'Google this','Wiki that' \n\nLocation: 'Where am I?' \n\nPlaces: 'Where is the nearest bank?' \n\nMathematics: 'Integrate sin x dx from x=0 to pi' \n\nUnits & Measures 'U.K. men's size 11 shoe in Japanese size' \n\nMoney & Finance 'What is the Apple stock price' \n\nDates & Times 'What is the current time in Tokyo?' \n\nCurrent Weather 'What will be the high temperature today?' \n\nHealth & Medicine 'What is the life expectancy of a U.S. female age 30?' \n\nPlaces & Geography 'Where is ZIP 60637?' \n\nSocioeconomic Data 'Compare the age pyramid of New York and Miami' \n\nPeople & History 'When did Gandhi die?' \n\nFood & Nutrition '2 slices of swiss cheese' \n\nPhysics: 'What is the speed of light?' \n\nMaterials: 'Show me Topaz' \n\nEducation: 'How many kids are repeating primary school in California?' \n\nCulture & Media: 'US constitution' \n\nOrganizations: 'New York University' \n\nAstronomy:'Star chart' \n\nTransportation: 'Compare total length of all roads in USA and China' \n\nWords & Linguistics: 'Show me words that rhyme with bear' \n\nEarth Sciences: 'When was the Jurassic Period?' \n\nLife Sciences:'Compare puma, lion, red fox' \n\nSports & Games:'San Francisco Giants' \n\nWeb & Computer Systems: 'What is the cheapest tablet?' \n\nColors: 'What do you get when you mix red and blue' \n\nThe answers are spoken out, and relevant images are given. \n\nYou can also just have a general chat with Eve. Test her witty personality or just ask her to tell a joke or two. \n\nCommon Questions and concerns: \n\nQ: Why do I get strange answers to my question? \nA: Voice Answer will first check it's knowledge servers, including Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha's award winning service, for an answer. If these don't respond, either because the answer is unavailable or the servers are down, the chatbot will answer the question. These answers are generally more funny than useful. You can avoid strange answers by disabling the chatbot, and try your question later. We are further enhancing our current data sources with additional databases as these become available, as we want to offer our customers the very best. \n\nQ: What do I do when voice answer doesn't understand my voice? \nA: Voice Answer compares your voice against a database of spoken english words and sentences. It works better for some people than for others. In general it works better than the voice recognition used by many other apps, but it depends on your accent. Try to speak slow and use regular sentences. If this doesn't work, you can use the keyboard. As and when better voice recognition algorithms are developed and become available, we can and will plug these in. \n\nQ: The app crashes. What can I do? \nA: On some devices such as the iPad1 or 3GS, it may sometimes be required to do a hard reset to get it to work. If this fails, removing the app and installing it again will generally get it going. We are working on improving the stability on those devices. \n\nPlease contact us at support@sparklingapps.com for any questions or comments. If you have any problems with any of the functions of the app, we can assist you with it. We are proud of our product and want our customers to get the most out of it."

I think the simplicity is what makes it so perfect. - Shane Domo\n\n* Perfect app for tracking hours worked for different customers. Not overly complicated. Most useful app I have. - SeabeeChief\n\n* This app is very simple to use and powerful.

      "label": "Remembering someone's name is one of the simplest, yet most powerful, ways of making a great impression.  Our app enables you to record, retain, and retrieve names and people whenever and wherever you are. \n\nIt makes a person feel good to hear their own name, and they pay more attention.  Research shows that hearing our name activates our brain, even when in a noisy room.  Influential leaders will make it a point to use people's names, and even to mention personal details that they share in common. They do this intentionally because they know it matters.  We feel better when people remember us, and worse when they don't.  When you forget someone's name, they feel that they (and their business!) are not important to you.\n\nIt is no exaggeration that business deals often fail because someone failed to remember the right name at the right time.  In the age of email and online relationships, being able to use someone's name in a face-to-face meeting can set you apart. We intuitively know this, and yet without conscious effort, name recall is an elusive skill.  To make matters worse, this skill worsens after middle-age unless we train ourselves to remember.\n\nWho's Who has an option for spaced repetition.  This is a cognitive phenomenon where people recall information better when studied a few times over a long period of time than when studied many times over a short period.  If crammed memories are not refreshed, they are likely to decay to nothing.  If you enable reminders on the name that you enter, you will be sent a simple notification with the new name at increasingly long intervals.  You can turn reminders off easily at any time.\n\nPersonal details such as hobbies or children's names can assist in memory recall.  Our memories are more like stories than items in a spreadsheet, and associating interesting tidbits with the name will actually help in recalling it. It is also useful to record when and where you met, not only because that data could be useful, but also it helps fill in the story that aids in memory recall. Our app has several optional fields for entering extraneous details for those very important contacts.  All of these fields can be searched in case you are trying to remember the name of the lady from \"Hawaii\" or the man who was an avid \"baseball\" fan.\n\nMemory experts often use mnemonics, word play, and outright whimsical visualizations. Think \"Joe from Jersey,\" \"Suzy sales,\" or \"Richard the rich guy.\"   You might picture Roseanne holding a bouquet of roses, or Nancy wearing fancy pants.  Shirley drinking a Shirley Temple. If you are so inclined, our app has a \"hint\" field to capture your creative associations. The hint is revealed on demand in the Quiz, so that you can practice active recall testing.  Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study.\n\nMost importantly, you must decide to make remembering names a priority.  The primary reason we have a problem remembering names is that we're not focused on learning it.  We have a lot of information competing for our attention, much of it more immediately important than a name.  Once you make the decision consciously to remember names because you care about the people you are interacting with, you immediately become much better at it.  Remember, people feel good when you remember their name, and worse when you don't."

      "label": "A Bíblia King James de 1611 é descrita como uma das publicações mais importantes da história, e também a mais fiel ao Textus Receptus. O rei James I da Inglaterra reuniu os maiores estudiosos religiosos e linguistas para uma nova tradução da Bíblia, a fim de estabelecer a tradução mais precisa e mais digna até à data. Ele nomeou 54 estudiosos para trabalhar na tradução, e 47 trabalharam em seis grupos em três locais por sete anos.\r\n\r\nApós a conclusão, a Bíblia King James foi impressa pela primeira vez em 1611 por Robert Barker. A Bíblia era muito grande, cerca de 40cm de altura. Por causa do alto custo e valor, foi anunciado para as igrejas que a Bíblia devia ser acorrentada nos púlpitos.\r\n\r\nA Bíblia 1611 foi autorizada para ser lida nas igrejas, razão pela qual foi chamada de Versão Autorizada. Enfim, nós da BV Books estamos felizes em poder apresentar, a Versão Autorizada em português da Bíblia King James."

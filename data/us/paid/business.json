To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

      "label": "This application offers a unique approach to project management, which represents your project not just as a plan, but as a coordinated mechanism moving towards the goal. \n\nThe original technique allows you to break down project objectives into smaller goals, processes and resources, but not get lost in the details, but always see the overall structure of the project as a whole. After all, project management is not a mechanical observance of the plan, but the achievement of project goals, which should not be overlooked.\n\nThe application combines the classic project approach based on Gantt charts and project management through workflow diagrams. As a rule, Gantt charts are ideal for presenting project schedules, but they are not so convenient for reflecting the complex structure of the relationship between processes, goals and resources.\n\nMore formally, the program allows you to build a customized, based on the BPMN notation, PERT diagram of the project (with events and processes at nodes). Then this description of the project is used to generate a Gantt chart and track the progress of the project. \n\nSo, inShort is a powerful project and business process management tool, which can be applied not only in office but also for personal purposes. You can further explore the capabilities of the program with the detailed interactive User Guide.\n\nKey features of the application: \n• Building the diagram of processes and resources of the project (PERT network diagram of the project, based on BPMN notation). \n• The ability to drill down the elements of workflow diagrams. \n• Tracking the execution of the project. \n• Integration with the standard Calendar.\n• Displaying the list of project tasks in the form of a Gantt chart. \n• Separation of physical and information flows of the project. \n• Ability to specify the expected time of execution, both directly and parametrically. \n• Export of charts into PDF files and OPML outlines.\n• Project management according to the methodology of the Theory of Constraints. \n• Working calendars taking into account various schedules of work for implementation of tasks. \n• Work resources and their assignment to tasks. \n• Queues of tasks: organize the work with active tasks in accordance with the elements of the GTD methodology.\n• Checklists for diagrams — monitor the sequence of actions for project management step by step.\n\nAdvanced features of project management in accordance with the Theory of Constraints technique: \n• finding the critical path; \n• positioning of time buffers of the project; \n• calculation of buffer sizes; \n• calculation of late starts for feeding paths of the project; \n• tracking of time indicators during project execution. \n\n***\ninShort Pro — application version for experienced and advanced users, contains advanced and service functions useful for in-depth work with diagrams.\nFunctions included in inShort Pro:\n• Working with layers of diagrams;\n• inReview: publications of user diagrams surveys by experienced project managers, indicating successful findings and weaknesses in the diagrams. The procedure for sending diagrams for analysis is described in the Terms of Use.\n\nThe inShort Pro version is available by monthly subscription. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\ninShort Pro Subscription Terms of Use link: http://www.shortki.com/inShort/proTerms.html\n***\n\nCannot solve a problem? Draw it inShort and sort things out with it there. It's like voodoo but it works."

Real Work answers the question—once and for all—how many dollars worth of value-add work are being produced vs. the dollars that the company paid to GET that work.\n\nReal Work not only provides performance and efficiency metrics for team members and teams—it also gives precise graphical breakdowns of value add vs. non-value add time and money spent, by category, for any predefined time period, for any work setting. Just create a list of commonly performed tasks and their hourly unit capacity rates, then create a blank performance scenario (for an individual team member, or for an entire team or department) and enter the requested scenario data into the app for the selected time period. Supervisors and managers immediately get the data they need in order to see what’s working—and who’s working—in a given operational area.\n\nIn addition to assessing performance in traditional work environments (like manufacturing or warehouse / fulfillment areas), Real Work can assess performance in non-traditional environments (like back office processing, financial services, IT and healthcare).\n\nReal Work’s email feature also allows users to send performance scenario metrics to themselves or anyone else for further review and analysis.\n\nNo matter the business environment, the Real Work app will find the hard-dollar buried treasure at your or your client’s company—down to the person, process and penny.\n\nAlso… be sure to check out the Real Work app’s RPM tab. You’ll get access to all thirteen Robust Production Management (RPM) modules. These are the same concepts and tools Metrilogics uses to deliver quantifiable bottom-line process improvement results for clients—everywhere, every time.

Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

      "label": "A must have for Professional Snow Plowers!  Plus it keeps getting better with each update!  Get the edge over your competition.\n\nHow long do you have to snow plow to pay for this app?  Minutes!  Think of it as less than the cost of (2) bags of ice melt or roughly 5% of a new cutting edge on your plow .  Think of it as the cheapest thing you will buy for your snow removal business besides the snacks at the gas station.  \n\nRead everything below to understand why it's worth purchasing....\n\nSnowClient was created by someone that has been in your shoes (snow boots), snow plowing through the night to have the properties clear by morning.\n\nThink about it!  No more clipboards, paper, and handwriting.  Handwriting that is hard to read and takes forever to organize to be able to invoice snow customers after the snow storm is over.  All the while you are hoping that your paperwork notes don't blow away, fall in the snow, or get stolen.  Then how are you supposed to know what hours to bill for and all the other information that was on that piece of paper?  The SnowClient app takes care of all of this.  \n\nWith SnowClient it is easy to document all the work you do and have it immediately organized and accessible in case your snow removal clients want to know when you serviced their property or how deep the snow was when you did service it.  You will have the info at your fingertips and will impress them with your ability to know the facts on the spot.\n\nNo more hours spent calculating your hours for each property to know what to put on the invoice.  It is done the moment you finish servicing the snow account and push stop.\n\nThen when invoicing, all you do is use the sort feature to filter by property and you have all the information you need to invoice for that specific property!\n\nYou can also sort by date and team leader (this could be the driver).\n\nAlso if you put the full address into the property info you or your employees can just click on it to get directions to that property.\n\nSimplify your snow business and minimize the headaches & work after the snow storm.   \n\nSnowClient Helps You Keep Track of:\n\n- Property Names\n\n- Property Details (Address, Deadline Time, Etc.)\n\n- Time Spent Working at Each Property\n\n- Employee Information (if needed)\n\n- Amounts of Salt or De-icing Materials Used at Each Property to be Billed for Later\n\n- Additional Notes - Write Notes and Other Messages That Are Unique to Your Company's Way of Doing Business or Other Information You Would Like but There is no Spot For it.\n\n- Which Employees Serviced Which Properties\n(Employees on the job)\n\nSnowClient Also Will:\n\n- Assist in Accurate Billing\n\n- Keep Work Information Organized\n\n- Create Documentation to Help in Legal Matters\n\n- And So Much More in the Future!\n\n***What this app does NOT do:\n\n- Store Your Information in the Cloud (all the info is stored on your phone)\n\n- Login for Different Users or Privileges\n\n- Sync Information Across Different Users Devices \n\n- Export to Excel or Quickbooks BUT there IS exporting (text, email, etc.)\n\n- Print (unless you export to notes then you can print from notes)\n\nWe know there are probably a lot more features including the ones listed under \"What this app is not\" that you would like to be able to have to help you manage your snow removal properties, snow removal employees, and snow removal customers.  \n\nPLEASE share your ideas with us so we can incorporate them into the app to better serve your needs.  We want to make sure you are satisfied!  We would like to see all 5 Star Reviews so help us out and give us feedback before slamming us with a bad review.  If your life is better because of this app then give us a good review:)  As snow plowers we know what it is like to only hear complaints and on the other side how good it feels when somebody appreciates the work we performed.\n\nSend us a message on our Facebook page by following the Support Link.  We are here for you!"

Areas with a significant risk of flooding can be located miles away from bodies of water or rivers, and lender-required flood insurance can put a reasonably priced home out of the reach of some buyers. Use FLOOD ZONE to identify these properties and save yourself and buyers time and frustration. Listing agents and sellers can benefit too. Purchasers need to know that increases in flood insurance premiums are affected by a property’s flood zone. The FLOOD ZONE app helps listing agents and sellers determine what they need to disclose when placing a home on the market. \n\nHome Owners: FLOOD ZONE can help you monitor if your property’s flood zone has changed because of flood map redrawing. Are you near the boundary of two different zones? Use FLOOD ZONE to see how close you are to higher risk. \n\nFLOOD ZONE shows FEMA approved flood hazard maps using National Flood Insurance Program data that is updated regularly. FLOOD ZONE is an informational tool and not a substitute for an elevation certificate performed by a qualified professional. Data is believed accurate but not guaranteed. This app is NOT an official NFIP or FEMA publication. Please refer to official FEMA and NFIP resources and appropriately qualified professionals for all related determinations.\n\nYou can customize the map to hide or show FIRM Panels, Flood Hazard Zones, LOMRs, LOMAs, River Mile Markers, Coastal Gages, Base Flood Elevations, Water Lines, Coastal Barrier Resources System Area, and Levees.\n\nThe app REQUIRES an auto-renew subscription to the online flood zone maps, offered as an in-app purchase. The app comes with a free trial of access to the flood zone maps before you have to buy anything.\n\nThere is an OPTIONAL auto-renew subscription to create Flood Hazard Determination PDF documents, offered as an in-app purchase. \n\nDiscounts may be provided for longer subscription periods. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user here: https://goo.gl/8gknaa\n\nSubscription auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\nhttp://www.ikonetics.com/app-site-terms-privacy.html"

      "label": "The Hidden Secrets to Profitability That Most Business Consultants Don't Want You To Know Are Just A Click Away.\r\n\r\n“If You Want To Grow Your Business Even Faster, This Little App Is Like Helium For A Balloon.”\r\n\r\n“We frequently need to price our products to sell well. Break-Even Analysis is one way to be sure that you are on the right track before you make a costly mistake.”\r\n\r\nB/E Analysis helps you to predict the sales volume required to reach your break-even point where your total cost equals your total revenue.  \r\n\r\nThe App goes one step further and suggests ways to help you increase your profits using your own input as a guide.\r\n\r\nIn 20 Seconds or Less You Can Now Get A Break-Even Analysis Done On Your iPhone!\r\n\r\nYes, Any Product, Any Service and Any Business - Even iPhone Development Projects Can Benefit From This App.\r\n\r\nAll you need to start are 4 basic numerical inputs and the desire to increase your bottom line profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO IS THIS APP FOR:\r\n- Small & Medium Sized Business Owners and Managers\r\n- Corporate Managers That Want A Quick Tool To Guide Them To Higher Profits\r\n- Shareholders, Stakeholders & Entrepreneurs\r\n\r\n\"I used it and decided to go with a 4% price increase. Customers didn’t even notice, my sales numbers stayed the same and it looks like this thing helped me to double my profits. I am blown away”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WILL THIS APP DO FOR YOU:\r\nBreak-Even Analysis is a report NOT normally produced by your accountant, nor is it automatically generated by most accounting software.\r\n\r\nRecent massive layoffs at large corporations are the direct result of an attempt to lower the break-even point of the target business to stay competitive, remain in business and try to increase profits at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf you run a business or a business division and you like to put more money into your pocket, knowing the Break-Even Point for any given product (or project) immediately tells you the lowest amount of business activity necessary to prevent losses. Armed with this information you can tweak your business to get more out of it.\r\n\r\nDo you know your business's Break-Even Point?\r\nWhat about the B/E Point for each of the products you sell?\r\n\r\n\r\nIS IT COMPLICATED:\r\nWe spent months breaking the process down into its core components and then building it back up again as an easy to use business tool. A group of young entrepreneurs gave us feedback after 60 days of using the tool before we went back to our developers and improved it all over again. Now it's your turn, take the App for a spin, use it in your business and let us know what you have achieved.\r\n\r\nAll you need to get going are four things: \r\n-\tThe cost to produce one unit of your product\r\n-\tYour Fixed Costs like rent, utilities and salaries\r\n-\tYour Sales Forecast for a given period and \r\n-\tYour Selling Price for the product\r\n\r\nHere's what a few of our Customers had to say about Break-Even Analysis.\r\n\r\n\"For an iPhone application, this thing is pricey but if you're in business, you'll probably figure out how to earn more money by using it just once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Breakeven is a no-brainer. Used properly, it'll help your business. Thanks again for the free bonus\"\r\n\r\n\"Knowing the elements of break-even analysis focused me on managing the costs that maximize our bottom line.  We definitely make more money today.\"\r\n\r\n“This little App works beautifully with the Apple iTunes Store rev share model. I love what you did with Sales Calc and Break-Even is even better - keep it coming”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS INCLUDED:\r\nIf you enter the 4 input variables, and hit the calculate button, your results are displayed immediately for you in the lower half of the screen. If you were to tap on the Profit or Loss text, a few helpful suggestions are displayed – all designed to improve your bottom line. To view your B/E point on a chart, be sure you have internet access and then turn the iPhone sideways.\r\n\r\nInstructions, definitions & explanations are all included in the Info area of the App."

SpeakerClock emulates the famous countdown clock that all speakers at TED conferences need to adhere to.\n\nStart the clock and place it within your view when giving a public talk to see at a glance how much speaking time you have remaining. The \"traffic light\" gives you visual feedback when it's time to wrap up or make your closing remarks.\n\nUse it for actual public speeches or train with it for the fateful day when you too get the call to speak on important issues.\n\n\"Personally I use SpeakerClock when timing the recording of YouTube videos. This way I never run over the maximum 10 minutes there and the \"traffic light\" helps me nail my closing arguments every time!\""

But it is not guess work. \n\nThe essential aspects of SEO can be addressed relatively predictably and mechanically if you understand how search engines work and appreciate that search engines are not some magical entity - search engines are rating a site based on what information is available to them on line. Simple.\n\nThe SEO-Keywords app aims to take care care of this mechanical predictable nature to unburden business owners, digital marketing managers and SEO practitioners, and save time and effort.\n\nOther tools are good (but expensive), but however quite often loose focus, can be clumsy, and are not easy to use or mobile first so just not handy for fitting SEO into busy business owner’s schedules. \n\n  * * * * *\n\nWhat is SEO?\n\nThere are two broad sources of digital information that help search engines to optimally find businesses against keywords and these can be optimised - this is SEO!\n\n1. Your Website \n\n2. Wider community Information (published articles, referrals, social media etc - these are all known as back-links)\n\nSEO-Keywords concentrates on the Website: Here information is grouped as “on-page” (what people can see), “off-page” (such as head meta tags) and technical “structured” (such as page load times, type of server, age of site, host quality, responsive, broken links ….).\n\n  * * * * *\n\nWhat are Keywords?\n\nYour campaigns, branding and aspirations define how you want others to see your business and hence what to be found for, particularly in a digital first approach. You are maybe striving to be known as the \"best car valet company in Milwaukee” - if so, your site needs to say this and keywords you want search engines to associate the website with in this instance maybe:\n\n- car valet Milwaukee\n\n- best car valet\n\nEtc …..\n\nSo firstly: you need to decide what your keywords and phrases are.\n\n   * * * * *\n\nHow does SEO-Keywords help?\n\nSEO-Keywords determines how often keywords appear and where: for example if they appear in your “Title\" meta-tags they they are deemed more important than in plain \"p\" paragraph text.\n\nIf you were to do this manually it would be quite error prone and take hours. Using the SEO-Keywords app it is repeatable, predictable and takes seconds.\n\nIf you want some advice , send me your URL and can show you how to use and how it can help!\n\n  * * * * *\n\nNotes:\n\n(1)  Please note Apple devices do not support downloading from unsecured, non-HTTPS enabled sites. If your site is not secure then please do not use this App as will not function due to Apple Security Policies.\n\n(2) Analyses first 100 Google positions only"

SA Contacts sends all of your contacts to you from your iPhone in a convenient zip file by email, USB, or through a webpage seen only on your local wifi network! Contact photos are sent, too!\n3.

SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16. All column headers and labels in the Excel file are localized.\n17. Export/Import contacts to/from a VCF file.\n18. Backup contacts before import.\n19. Manage groups easily.

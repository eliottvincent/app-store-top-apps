Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

Press power button, you can see signal strength bar moving, then slide the thumb to set the threshold (0.00~1.00), the value will be saved for next time use. \n\n2.If the indicator start flashing, that means a real recording start. check the recorded files,some test files can be found  there . \n\n3.In each scenario, the threshold value could be different, set it according to the situation. For example,for snoring and dream talk recording at night, set the value to 0.05, but at daytime, you probably have to set it at 0.10. \n\n4.

Label,as a part of a file name, has to follow some rules for different computer OS.For this app, make it simple as follows,the name length is better to be limited to within 125 characters,as for the kind of characters, for Windows,you can't use ?\\|/ etc. in your label, otherwise iTunes will report a error such as no files found, just rename it as windows' requirement to fix it.\n\n\n**About Volume**\nSpeaker mode or earphone mode,  the speaker hardware is shared by all apps in your device, please check both modes and adjust the volume if you can't hear anything.\n\n**How to download recording files**\nFor file downloading,  iTunes File sharing Feature is recommended.

      "label": "Subnet Calc Pro is a tool designed to help network administrators who need to keep track of the various subnets which they administer.\n\nInside the ORGANISER you can define subnets by selecting an IP and CIDR. You can save the subnets which you manage in a hierarchy so that you can keep track of how you have allocated and split up your subnets into smaller subnets. Also, you can add hosts inside each subnet so that you can keep track of IP allocations. For each defined subnet, Subnet Calc Pro will calculate all details including its class and even whether or not the IP is in the loopback / private ranges.\n\nThere is also a handy subnet FINDER which is an aggregator and can be used to calculate the smallest subnet which encompasses a given set of IPs. This can be useful if you need to figure out a subnet mask which will allow a given set of IPs to talk to each other.\n\nAlso included is a standard subnet CALCULATOR which is the same as the free version of the software called Subnet Calc.\n\nFinally, you can even export all your data from the database by email."

Then, export the layout as an image, or as a CSV file.\n\nThe app supports multiple rack designs.\n\nRather than incorporating a vast symbol library, by allowing you to select the device icon from your device gallery, you can feature symbols, manufacturer logos or other appropriate images.\n\nDevice colours can be separated into industry standards, blue for audio, green for video, or be adjusted to suit your company brand colours.\n\nThe app is designed to provide rack layout only, and does not allow for connections to be shown between devices."

      "label": "I started off selling small handmade items on various sites.  Initially, I struggled with pricing.  How do you balance costs, while at the same time making a decent profit.  To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

There is no centralized (shared) storage space on your device. This means that this app's proprietary printing engine only works within this app. The iOS cannot use this app to print files within another app's storage space—for example, files stored in Pages, Numbers, Safari, Notes, Mail, etc. Therefore, files created in other apps must be imported into this app.)\n\n\nHOW DO I IMPORT FILES INTO THIS APP?\n• Use a web browser to transfer files between your computer and this app.\n• Use iTunes to upload files into this app.\n• Use a WebDAV server to transfer files.\n• Email a file to yourself. Then, open the Mail app, press and hold down the attachment until the \"Open In...\" menu appears. Select this app from the list of apps displayed.\n\n\nIS THERE HELP AVAILABLE?\nYes. In addition to the built-in user guide, you can also ask questions via our real-time chat Customer Support module.\n\n\n\n[1] Each fax unit purchases a one-page fax that can be sent in 60 seconds or less to a destination in the United States or Canada. The number of fax units needed to transmit a one-page 60-second fax to a destination in another country is listed in the rate card within this app. Please note that a page that requires a longer transmission time (for example, a page containing high resolution graphics) consumes additional fax units.\n[2] To receive voicemail or faxes, you must setup an incoming toll-free phone number. The toll-free phone number requires a monthly subscription. 60 minutes/month are included free with subscription. Toll-free numbers are USA-based numbers and are accessible in the United States only.\nOptional Toll Free Number Subscription Notes: \n• Title: Toll-Free Number Subscription\n• Length: 1,3, 6 or 12 month options \n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at purchase confirmation\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n• No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active period \n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase\n• Privacy Policy: https://www.ndilitechnologies.com/privacy.html\n• Terms of use: https://www.ndilitechnologies.com/termsofuse.html"

      "label": "Scan and OCR (Optical Character Recognition / Recognize Text) documents in PDF.\n\nOCR and all image processing are performed on user devices so there is no data exposure risk.\n\nDocOCR turned your iPhone / iPad into a powerful scanner for text recognition.\n\nUse it to scan and OCR not only documents, but also books, whiteboards, receipts, business cards, posters, coupons, ...etc. as PDFs, and annotate or sign the scanned PDFs.\n\nPhoto Collage:\n- Combine multiple pages into one sheet.\nIt's very useful especially when you need to print multiple pages (e.g. two sides of ID cards) on one A4/Letter paper.\n\nIt can automatically detect document edges and surface in a picture, dewarp curved surface, correct perspective distortion, remove shadows and brighten it up to produce a clear and sharp document, especially useful in a low-light environment. \n\nIt is easy to drag and drop files to group them in a folder and organize in many ways: create, delete, edit, rename, deplicate, merge, split, and move documents between folders. You can search documents by name easily in the app.\n\nBy turning on the auto file sync with iCloud Drive, you can easily access your scanned documents from any other device.\nBy turning on WiFi file sharing, you can read all PDF files on the device.\n\nYou can also email documents out as PDF or JPEG files.\nExport OCR result as txt or docx file.\n\nOther ways to import / export documents: \n- Fax documents to over 100 countries instantly (cost calculated by the number of pages and recipient country and paid via in-app purchase).\n- Transfer all your documents from one device to another.\n- Support import / upload to SMB (Win / Mac / NAS).\n- Support import / upload to iCloud Drive.\n- Support import / upload to Dropbox.\n- Support import / upload to Google Drive.\n- Support import / upload to Box.\n- Support import / upload to SkyDrive.\n- Support import / upload to WebDAV Server.\n- Print documents via AirPrint.  \n- Save documents to Photo Albums. \n- \"Open In\" other apps, e.g. iBooks, Kindle, Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nImport Files: \n- Import PDFs via \"Open In\" from other apps.\n- Import PDF/JPEG from cloud storages.\n\nFax:\n- In-app fax sending and receiving is convenient especially when you are out of office or have no fax machine at all. \n- Receive a push notification when a fax is sent or received succesffuly or failed for what reason.\n- Receive faxes with non auto renewable subscription which supports dozens of countries (we kept adding more) for users to subscribe a fax number for receiving faxes.\n- Deny all faxes when no need to receive any fax.\n\nTip: For best edge detection, please place your documents in high contrast to the background, e.g. put your white paper on a dark table. \n\nYour feedbacks are very important to us. \nPlease contact our customer service at support@ifunplay.com for resolving problems before submitting feedback in appstore. Most problems can be solved easily, but we cannot help you solve problems from the comments."

But, unlike the standard version of Time Clock Helper, this app adds several requested features.  First of all, you can finally not only view saved punches, but you can also edit them. You can also have as many or as few break periods as you would want in a day.  These additions were made without the need to sacrifice a simple, quick and easy to use interface.  The app also allows you to choose if you want the times rounded, or not - including both commonly used 6 and 15 minutes rounding options. \n\nIf that wasn't enough, the app allows you to change many aspects of the display in order to meet your needs.  You can set everything from the way the hours are displayed (either as a decimal or an hour and minute breakdown), to if you display individual punches with the list of days or not.\n\nSome of the features in this app:\n\n* The ability to handle multiple breaks\n* The ability to edit old punches - including the recorded date.\n* The days are always kept in date order no matter in what order they were entered.\n* The ability to delete punches and recorded days.\n* An instant total showing how many hours worked along with hours on break.\n* The ability to handle punches that go past midnight.\n* The ability to round punches to the 0, 6 and 15 minute increments.\n* Fully supports dark mode.\n* Allows you to either print or email all of your recorded punches.\n* The app is easy to use and self-explanatory. \n* The ability to change settings to update your display for your liking.\n\nIf you have comments or requests, feel free to email them to me."

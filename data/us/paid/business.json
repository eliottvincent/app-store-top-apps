      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

This is more than what is available on the FEMA site; it automatically completes the SFHDF form including the Community and map panel information, and provides a map showing the property with the FEMA / NFIP overlay!\n\nFLOOD ZONE quickly and easily gives you the FEMA designated flood zone of your current location or a point you choose on a map. Real estate agents, insurance agents, GIS professionals, surveyors, landowners and anyone with an interest in flood related products or services will find this app's subscription service easy, quick and very affordable. \n\nRealtors and Real estate agents: Add value to the service you provide. Top agents are knowledgeable of flood zones. Areas with a significant risk of flooding can be located miles away from bodies of water or rivers, and lender-required flood insurance can put a reasonably priced home out of the reach of some buyers. Use FLOOD ZONE to identify these properties and save yourself and buyers time and frustration. Listing agents and sellers can benefit too. Purchasers need to know that increases in flood insurance premiums are affected by a property’s flood zone. The FLOOD ZONE app helps listing agents and sellers determine what they need to disclose when placing a home on the market. \n\nHome Owners: FLOOD ZONE can help you monitor if your property’s flood zone has changed because of flood map redrawing. Are you near the boundary of two different zones? Use FLOOD ZONE to see how close you are to higher risk. \n\nFLOOD ZONE shows FEMA approved flood hazard maps using National Flood Insurance Program data that is updated regularly. FLOOD ZONE is an informational tool and not a substitute for an elevation certificate performed by a qualified professional. Data is believed accurate but not guaranteed. This app is NOT an official NFIP or FEMA publication. Please refer to official FEMA and NFIP resources and appropriately qualified professionals for all related determinations.\n\nYou can customize the map to hide or show FIRM Panels, Flood Hazard Zones, LOMRs, LOMAs, River Mile Markers, Coastal Gages, Base Flood Elevations, Water Lines, Coastal Barrier Resources System Area, and Levees.\n\nThe app REQUIRES an auto-renew subscription to the online flood zone maps, offered as an in-app purchase. The app comes with a free trial of access to the flood zone maps before you have to buy anything.\n\nThere is an OPTIONAL auto-renew subscription to create Flood Hazard Determination PDF documents, offered as an in-app purchase. \n\nDiscounts may be provided for longer subscription periods. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user here: https://goo.gl/8gknaa\n\nSubscription auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\nhttp://www.ikonetics.com/app-site-terms-privacy.html"

      "label": "Launch your discreet, skillful campaign for power at work: immediately.\n\n“Foundations” is the first in a series of apps that provide discreet, on-the-job training in the Arts of Power: how to acquire, maintain, and expand your power in the workplace. It is based on the New York Times best-selling book, The 48 Laws of Power, by Robert Greene.\n\n**Thousands of successful users from around the world since June 2011**\n\nThis system does not provide you with sugar-coated, politically correct sayings and exercises. Nor does it offer the ubiquitous “secret-formula” for rapid success still used by charlatans to this day.\n\nReal, lasting power is gained by seeing the world clearly (no matter how ugly some of it may be), and by playing the game of power: subtly, skillfully, and in a way that reflects your own uniqueness.\n\nPlay this social game wisely, and not only will you maximize your power, you will do so in a way that is fun AND profoundly reflects who you are.\n\nRemember: power isn’t the problem, powerlessness is.\n\nCONTENTS\nThe Foundations app utilizes:\n- 25 audio sessions + 5 Bonus sessions (approx. 15 min. each, 9hrs in total)\n- 4 Integrated Tools (always accessible)\n- A member’s web site (for home use)\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nIdeally, listen to one audio session on the way to work, as a morning briefing for your day ahead.\n\nWhile you listen, you are given the opportunity to reflect on how various portions of Greene’s text (plus real-world business examples) relate to your situation. Each session ends with a suggested action designed to help you discreetly and skillfully enhance your power that day at work. \n\nEach session also brings you closer to revealing and strengthening the Foundations of your power: the powerful skills, behaviours and perspectives you already have to some degree. Refine these, and it not only increases your power immediately at work, it also gives you the solid base you need to add power-enhancing capabilities that are new to you.\n\nDuring the day you record any observations or planned actions within the four integrated tools.\n\nThe four tools are: \n1) REFLECTOR: Self Assessment\n2) DOSSIER: Analyzing the people you work with\n3) STRATEGY: Your plans to enhance your power\n4) PERSONA: A vision of the most powerful - and sustainable - aspects of your character that you should present to the world\n\nAs you complete each audio session, a new element is released within one of the tools to help you quickly record your observations and strategies.\n\nBy the time you finish the primary 25 sessions, the observations you have made, and strategies you have designed in the four tools, guide you along your own, unique pathway to mastery. Listen to the sessions again and again, or just keep refining and adding to what you’ve entered within the tools.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO OUR V1.X USERS:\nRobert Greene has been following the development and testing of this unique mastery system over the years. It was directly through the insightful feedback from our first generation users - and the endlessly practical wisdom of Greene’s work - that the 5 new bonus sessions 26-30 came to be. \n\nWARNING! Action-based program\nPursuing mastery requires taking real-world action: however since AMS cannot know your exact situation, this app provides you with suggested actions.  These actions are specific enough to be understood, but must be adapted to fit your unique disposition and situation. Therefore, we cannot know what form your final actions will take or be responsible for any consequences.\n\nRest assured however, Mastering The 48 Laws of Power is all about taking wise, subtle action."

      "label": "WebFrame allows you to turn an iOS device into a single-purpose kiosk displaying full-screen web apps, web pages, multimedia, documents, and more.  WebFrame features the following capabilities:\n\n• Full Screen Browser:  WebFrame provides a full-screen browser with no address or navigation bars.  This allows you to create a true kiosk experience and keeps users in the web site, web app, document, or multimedia you intended.\n\n• Approved Domain List:  Limit browsing to approved domains to prevent users from leaving the site or web app you have configured.\n\n• Inactivity Timeout: Monitor user activity and reload homepage, dim the screen, and/or load a blank screen if no user activity has taken place for a selected duration. Optionally, you can choose to clear the browser cache on timeout to ensure previous user session data is deleted.\n\n• Augmented Reality: Create an infinite showroom with augmented reality experiences.  AR models in .USDZ or .Reality format will be loaded into an AR Quick View.\n\n• QR and Bar Code Reader: Allow customers to lookup products, allow employees to access and/or login to unlinked pages, or more.  Reader returns string to JavaScript to handle as you wish.\n\n• QR and Bar Code Reader: Allow customers to lookup products, allow employees to access and/or login to unlinked pages, or more.  Reader returns string to JavaScript to handle as you wish.\n\n• Smart Navigation Buttons:  WebFrame now supports navigation buttons that will automatically show and hide depending on the ability to navigate backward and forward, and home.  They can also be configured to dynamically slide offscreen as the page scrolls to minimize their visual impact.  Finally, they can be repositioned vertically on the screen to prevent obscuring underlying page content.\n\n• User Interaction Controls:  Control how users interact with your kiosk and allow or disallow swipe navigation, pull-to-refresh, vertical scroll and horizontal pan gestures, pinch and double-tap zoom gestures, or disable user interaction entirely.\n\n• Printer Support:  Allow users to print from your kiosk using HTML window.print() capabilities or disable to prevent printing.\n\n• Local Configuration:  All configuration of WebFrame is handled locally through the iOS Settings app or through in-app settings."

      "label": "The Hidden Secrets to Profitability That Most Business Consultants Don't Want You To Know Are Just A Click Away.\r\n\r\n“If You Want To Grow Your Business Even Faster, This Little App Is Like Helium For A Balloon.”\r\n\r\n“We frequently need to price our products to sell well. Break-Even Analysis is one way to be sure that you are on the right track before you make a costly mistake.”\r\n\r\nB/E Analysis helps you to predict the sales volume required to reach your break-even point where your total cost equals your total revenue.  \r\n\r\nThe App goes one step further and suggests ways to help you increase your profits using your own input as a guide.\r\n\r\nIn 20 Seconds or Less You Can Now Get A Break-Even Analysis Done On Your iPhone!\r\n\r\nYes, Any Product, Any Service and Any Business - Even iPhone Development Projects Can Benefit From This App.\r\n\r\nAll you need to start are 4 basic numerical inputs and the desire to increase your bottom line profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO IS THIS APP FOR:\r\n- Small & Medium Sized Business Owners and Managers\r\n- Corporate Managers That Want A Quick Tool To Guide Them To Higher Profits\r\n- Shareholders, Stakeholders & Entrepreneurs\r\n\r\n\"I used it and decided to go with a 4% price increase. Customers didn’t even notice, my sales numbers stayed the same and it looks like this thing helped me to double my profits. I am blown away”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WILL THIS APP DO FOR YOU:\r\nBreak-Even Analysis is a report NOT normally produced by your accountant, nor is it automatically generated by most accounting software.\r\n\r\nRecent massive layoffs at large corporations are the direct result of an attempt to lower the break-even point of the target business to stay competitive, remain in business and try to increase profits at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf you run a business or a business division and you like to put more money into your pocket, knowing the Break-Even Point for any given product (or project) immediately tells you the lowest amount of business activity necessary to prevent losses. Armed with this information you can tweak your business to get more out of it.\r\n\r\nDo you know your business's Break-Even Point?\r\nWhat about the B/E Point for each of the products you sell?\r\n\r\n\r\nIS IT COMPLICATED:\r\nWe spent months breaking the process down into its core components and then building it back up again as an easy to use business tool. A group of young entrepreneurs gave us feedback after 60 days of using the tool before we went back to our developers and improved it all over again. Now it's your turn, take the App for a spin, use it in your business and let us know what you have achieved.\r\n\r\nAll you need to get going are four things: \r\n-\tThe cost to produce one unit of your product\r\n-\tYour Fixed Costs like rent, utilities and salaries\r\n-\tYour Sales Forecast for a given period and \r\n-\tYour Selling Price for the product\r\n\r\nHere's what a few of our Customers had to say about Break-Even Analysis.\r\n\r\n\"For an iPhone application, this thing is pricey but if you're in business, you'll probably figure out how to earn more money by using it just once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Breakeven is a no-brainer. Used properly, it'll help your business. Thanks again for the free bonus\"\r\n\r\n\"Knowing the elements of break-even analysis focused me on managing the costs that maximize our bottom line.  We definitely make more money today.\"\r\n\r\n“This little App works beautifully with the Apple iTunes Store rev share model. I love what you did with Sales Calc and Break-Even is even better - keep it coming”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS INCLUDED:\r\nIf you enter the 4 input variables, and hit the calculate button, your results are displayed immediately for you in the lower half of the screen. If you were to tap on the Profit or Loss text, a few helpful suggestions are displayed – all designed to improve your bottom line. To view your B/E point on a chart, be sure you have internet access and then turn the iPhone sideways.\r\n\r\nInstructions, definitions & explanations are all included in the Info area of the App."

      "label": "Use the XR-3 Remote companion app to remotely monitor and control Applied Instruments' WiFi enabled XR-3 Modular Test Instrument when paired with a compatible iPhone or iPad.  The iOS mobile device connects to the XR-3 satellite meter using WiFi technology without using any 4G data and without going through the internet.\n\nApplication example: Connect your XR-3 satellite meter at the ground block location and power on the XR-3.  Then pair your XR-3 to your iOS mobile device via WiFi.  Climb the ladder with your phone on an armband, run the XR-3 Remote app, and check signal level and quality and re-align your satellite dish without having to first remove the LNBF head and temporarily connect short coax jumper cables from the LNBF to your satellite meter.  The XR-3 meter's screen is mirrored on your mobile device, allowing you to identify the satellite, toggle to different satellites and transponders and measure RF level, demodulated signal quality, and LNB LO drift.  This method offers safety and speed advantages for the satellite technician.\n\nPresent Limitations:\n1) Only works with XR-3 hardware version 3.01 (XR-3's with optional WiFi hardware module installed).  To confirm the hardware version of your XR-3, press MENU, select Versions from the Main Menu and refer to the Base HW Version field.  If your XR-3 doesn't have hardware version 3.01, contact Applied Instruments for a quote to have it modified.\n2) XR-3 Remote app only works with the XR-3's satellite meter modules.  Support for the cable modules will be coming soon!\n3) Only the XR-3's main Run screen, AZ/EL screens, and limit scan screens are viewable and controllable via the mobile device.  Increased functionality (more screens) will be offered at a later date via software updates.\n4) Only 1 mobile device can be connected to each XR-3 at a time.\n5) WiFi range of iOS mobile device to XR-3 satellite meter varies depending on obstacles and terrain, but is approximately 100 to 300 feet.\n\nWhat do I need to get started?\n1) iPhone or iPad\n2) WiFi Enabled XR-3 Modular Test Instrument (hardware version 3.01) with a related satellite meter module\n\nFor more details about WiFi functions of the WiFi-enabled XR-3, visit http://www.appliedin.com/www/assets/products/XR_3/downloads/XR-3_Meter_WiFi_Operations.pdf\n\nFor more details about the XR-3 Remote iOS app, visit http://www.appliedin.com/www/assets/products/XR_3/downloads/XR-3_Remote_iOS_App.pdf\n\nHow do I link my iOS mobile device to the XR-3?\n1)\tPower on your XR‐3.\n2)\tTurn on Wi‐Fi on your iPhone or iPad if it’s not already enabled.\n3)\tWhen searching on your iOS device for the wireless network that you’d like to join, select the SSID (name) of your\nXR‐3 and enter the password.\n4)\tIn your XR‐3, you can view and modify its related SSID and password by selecting MENU --> WiFi --> \nWiFi Menu --> WiFi Options --> Hands Free Cfg.\n5)\tOn your XR‐3, exit the WiFi menu to return to the meter’s Run screen (where your bar graphs are shown)\n6)\tOn your iPhone or iPad, open the XR‐3 Remote app. The phone will sync with your meter and your meter’s main Run screen display will be mirrored on the phone.\n\nLearn more about the Applied Instruments XR-3 and other Applied Instruments products at www.appliedin.com"

Presenting a financial amount as the 'cost of risk or uncertainty' allows for a much more informed discussion with senior leaders and board members. It also allows for a better estimate for the contingency funds required in evaluating a decision or a project. \n\nSoftware solutions that typically do this are often complex and expensive. This app provides a simple and cost-effective solution at your fingertips. It is your first step in moving away from a subjective list of assumptions and uncertainties to a much more effective way to consider risk.\n\nThe app is a Monte-Carlo risk simulator that is capable of running hundreds of thousands of simulations to provide a quantified 'cost of risk or uncertainty' that should be factored into any decision. This is underpinned by well established data science and statistical math.

      "label": "A must have for Professional Snow Plowers!  Plus it keeps getting better with each update!  Get the edge over your competition.\n\nHow long do you have to snow plow to pay for this app?  Minutes!  Think of it as less than the cost of (2) bags of ice melt or roughly 5% of a new cutting edge on your plow .  Think of it as the cheapest thing you will buy for your snow removal business besides the snacks at the gas station.  \n\nRead everything below to understand why it's worth purchasing....\n\nSnowClient was created by someone that has been in your shoes (snow boots), snow plowing through the night to have the properties clear by morning.\n\nThink about it!  No more clipboards, paper, and handwriting.  Handwriting that is hard to read and takes forever to organize to be able to invoice snow customers after the snow storm is over.  All the while you are hoping that your paperwork notes don't blow away, fall in the snow, or get stolen.  Then how are you supposed to know what hours to bill for and all the other information that was on that piece of paper?  The SnowClient app takes care of all of this.  \n\nWith SnowClient it is easy to document all the work you do and have it immediately organized and accessible in case your snow removal clients want to know when you serviced their property or how deep the snow was when you did service it.  You will have the info at your fingertips and will impress them with your ability to know the facts on the spot.\n\nNo more hours spent calculating your hours for each property to know what to put on the invoice.  It is done the moment you finish servicing the snow account and push stop.\n\nThen when invoicing, all you do is use the sort feature to filter by property and you have all the information you need to invoice for that specific property!\n\nYou can also sort by date and team leader (this could be the driver).\n\nAlso if you put the full address into the property info you or your employees can just click on it to get directions to that property.\n\nSimplify your snow business and minimize the headaches & work after the snow storm.   \n\nSnowClient Helps You Keep Track of:\n\n- Property Names\n\n- Property Details (Address, Deadline Time, Etc.)\n\n- Time Spent Working at Each Property\n\n- Employee Information (if needed)\n\n- Amounts of Salt or De-icing Materials Used at Each Property to be Billed for Later\n\n- Additional Notes - Write Notes and Other Messages That Are Unique to Your Company's Way of Doing Business or Other Information You Would Like but There is no Spot For it.\n\n- Which Employees Serviced Which Properties\n(Employees on the job)\n\nSnowClient Also Will:\n\n- Assist in Accurate Billing\n\n- Keep Work Information Organized\n\n- Create Documentation to Help in Legal Matters\n\n- And So Much More in the Future!\n\n***What this app does NOT do:\n\n- Store Your Information in the Cloud (all the info is stored on your phone)\n\n- Login for Different Users or Privileges\n\n- Sync Information Across Different Users Devices \n\n- Export to Excel or Quickbooks BUT there IS exporting (text, email, etc.)\n\n- Print (unless you export to notes then you can print from notes)\n\nWe know there are probably a lot more features including the ones listed under \"What this app is not\" that you would like to be able to have to help you manage your snow removal properties, snow removal employees, and snow removal customers.  \n\nPLEASE share your ideas with us so we can incorporate them into the app to better serve your needs.  We want to make sure you are satisfied!  We would like to see all 5 Star Reviews so help us out and give us feedback before slamming us with a bad review.  If your life is better because of this app then give us a good review:)  As snow plowers we know what it is like to only hear complaints and on the other side how good it feels when somebody appreciates the work we performed.\n\nSend us a message on our Facebook page by following the Support Link.  We are here for you!"

      "label": "I started off selling small handmade items on various sites.  Initially, I struggled with pricing.  How do you balance costs, while at the same time making a decent profit.  To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

      "label": "This app offers four different calculations and shows the results both in a pane and on a psychrometric diagram:\r\n1. Air treatment\r\n   Calculates how to convert a given ambient air to a required design air. The steps involved are cooling with a given sensible heat factor, dehumidifying, heating and humidifying (adiabatic or steam). Depending on the given and required air conditions, some of these steps may not be needed.\r\n\r\n2. Capacities\r\n   Calculates the required capacity to cool down or heat up a given amount of air (e.g. air in your room).\r\n\r\n3. Heat exchanger\r\n   Calculates how warm room air heats up cool ambient air before supplying it as fresh air to the room. While heating up the ambient air, the heat exchanger cools down the room air, which may result in condensate. When the ambient air would be too cold, this calculation dimensions an electric heater to prevent condensate.\r\n\r\n4. Carburetor icing\r\n   Given a temperature and a dew point temperature, calculates the probability of icing in an airplane carburetor. Graphically shows the danger zones on a diagram.\r\n\r\nThese four calculations show the results in a pane, but also graphically in a diagram. You can choose between three different diagrams:\r\n1. Psychrometric\r\n   This is the classic diagram representing different kinds of air properties into a single diagram. You find detailed descriptions in standard books about air treatment, such as ASHRAE. This diagram shows lines of constant temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy and specific volume.\r\n\r\n2. Mollier\r\n   This is probably the oldest diagram to represent air properties and named after its inventor Richard Mollier (1863-1935). To get a psychrometrics diagram from a Mollier diagram, swap it along the vertical axis and rotate it 90°.\r\n   The Mollier diagram is heavily used in Eastern Europe and Germany and shows the same lines as in the psychrometrics diagram.\r\n\r\n3. Dewpoint\r\n   This diagram is meant for meteorologists and pilots. It is easy to read important weather data, such as temperature, dew point and relative humidity. However, this diagram shows the same constant lines as for the other two. Interestingly, the straight lines in the other two diagrams become curved lines in this one and vice versa.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n- Select two air properties to define a point: dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy, specific volume and moist air density.\r\n- No need for a keyboard. Enter data using buttons for small and large value increments.\r\n- Choose between metric or imperial unit dimensions, e.g. °C and °F or kW and BTU/h.\r\n- See immediate results of any change on the diagrams and the result panel shows detailed information about a point on the diagram.\r\n- Choose one of the diagram types (Psychrometrics, Mollier or Dewpoint) for the graphical results. Hide some constant lines on the selected diagram to simplify it. Define colors for the diagram lines and the background gradient.\r\n- Define the efficiency properties of a heat exchanger, giving you professional results.\r\n- Tap the explain tab to get a short explanation of a calculation or a diagram.\r\n- Zoom in (two fingers gesture) and pan (one finger gesture) to enlarge and move a part of the diagram.\r\n- The app saves your latest settings and starts up with those settings.\r\n- Supports five languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Dutch), which you can set in the preferences.\r\n- Supports light and dark themes."

Swiftly auto dial through intelligently sorted call lists, review detailed analytics of call sessions, and swiftly take follow-up actions without ever leaving the app. Make phone calls without having to dial a number into a keypad. SwiftCall is the way call time was meant to be.\n\nCollaboration is key, and SwiftCall makes it easy to make sales calls as a team with lead sharing and analytics reporting.

Share leads easily between SwiftCallers to work together as a team.\n\nAnalytics & Achievements:\nIf you can't measure, you can't manage.

Review call logs and achievements earned to measure long-term performance. Create reports from the Dashboard to show off your performance to the team.\n\nFollow-Up Actions:\nCall time doesn’t just stop with the call. You want to stay fresh in the mind of your lead so they know that their time is valued. That’s why SwiftCall can quickly send follow-up emails or text messages as a follow-up. The Planner then helps schedule the next call and creates notifications for when the time comes to call again. If you have it enabled, Siri Suggestions will also prompt you right before your scheduled call, allowing you to tap the notification to dial in.\n\nMaybe you are hustling to build your business, or perhaps you work on a sales team with big dreams.

A SWOT analysis can be carried out for a company, product, place, industry, or person. It involves specifying the objectives of the business venture or project and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieve that objective. \n\nStrengths: characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others\n\nWeaknesses: characteristics of the business that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others\n\nOpportunities: elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage\n\nThreats: elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project\n\n\nIdentification of SWOTs is important because they can inform later steps in planning to achieve the objective. First, decision-makers should consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. If the objective is not attainable, they must select a different objective and repeat the process.\n\nUsers of SWOT analysis must ask and answer questions that generate meaningful information for each category (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) to make the analysis useful and find their competitive advantage."

There is no centralized (shared) storage space on your device. This means that this app's proprietary printing engine only works within this app. The iOS cannot use this app to print files within another app's storage space—for example, files stored in Pages, Numbers, Safari, Notes, Mail, etc. Therefore, files created in other apps must be imported into this app.)\n\n\nHOW DO I IMPORT FILES INTO THIS APP?\n• Use a web browser to transfer files between your computer and this app.\n• Use iTunes to upload files into this app.\n• Use a WebDAV server to transfer files.\n• Email a file to yourself. Then, open the Mail app, press and hold down the attachment until the \"Open In...\" menu appears. Select this app from the list of apps displayed.\n\n\nIS THERE HELP AVAILABLE?\nYes. In addition to the built-in user guide, you can also ask questions via our real-time chat Customer Support module.\n\n\n\n[1] Each fax unit purchases a one-page fax that can be sent in 60 seconds or less to a destination in the United States or Canada. The number of fax units needed to transmit a one-page 60-second fax to a destination in another country is listed in the rate card within this app. Please note that a page that requires a longer transmission time (for example, a page containing high resolution graphics) consumes additional fax units.\n[2] To receive voicemail or faxes, you must setup an incoming toll-free phone number. The toll-free phone number requires a monthly subscription. 60 minutes/month are included free with subscription. Toll-free numbers are USA-based numbers and are accessible in the United States only.\nOptional Toll Free Number Subscription Notes: \n• Title: Toll-Free Number Subscription\n• Length: 1,3, 6 or 12 month options \n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at purchase confirmation\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n• No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active period \n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase\n• Privacy Policy: https://www.ndilitechnologies.com/privacy.html\n• Terms of use: https://www.ndilitechnologies.com/termsofuse.html"

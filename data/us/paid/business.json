Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms.

Take screenshots and share the AR views and beams with your friends and colleagues\n\nOne year of free footprints updates is included!"

Winmail Reader decodes \"winmail.dat\" file, and allows any attachments contained in them to be opened, read, saved or e-mailed.\n\n* * * Winmail Reader for Mac is also available on the Mac App Store. * * *\n\nWinmail.dat files are in fact TNEF format (Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format). Microsoft Outlook e-mail program for Windows send e-mails as TNEF. Most other e-mail programs, including Mail, do not understand TNEF. If your e-mail program doesn't understand TNEF, you may only see an attachment named \"winmail.dat\" that you cannot open. The easy-to-use solution to circumvent this problem is provided by Winmail Reader.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n◆ Decodes \"winmail.dat\" files and list all attachments contained in it including email message.\n\n◆ Inbuilt quick-look preview to view attachments. Tap on attachment button to popup quick-look preview.\n\n◆ Allows attachments files to Copy to… another application, Save to Files, Copy, Print, share file to nearby iOS devices via AirDrop and more... Long press on attachment button to show share action options.\n\n◆ Resend entire decoded email as it is with message and extracted attachments.\n\n◆ Creates, edit and adds Microsoft Outlook Appointment and Meeting to iOS Calendar.

The iOS mobile device connects to the XR-3 satellite meter using WiFi technology without using any 4G data and without going through the internet.\n\nApplication example: Connect your XR-3 satellite meter at the ground block location and power on the XR-3.  Then pair your XR-3 to your iOS mobile device via WiFi.  Climb the ladder with your phone on an armband, run the XR-3 Remote app, and check signal level and quality and re-align your satellite dish without having to first remove the LNBF head and temporarily connect short coax jumper cables from the LNBF to your satellite meter.  The XR-3 meter's screen is mirrored on your mobile device, allowing you to identify the satellite, toggle to different satellites and transponders and measure RF level, demodulated signal quality, and LNB LO drift.  This method offers safety and speed advantages for the satellite technician.\n\nPresent Limitations:\n1) Only works with XR-3 hardware version 3.01 (XR-3's with optional WiFi hardware module installed).  To confirm the hardware version of your XR-3, press MENU, select Versions from the Main Menu and refer to the Base HW Version field.  If your XR-3 doesn't have hardware version 3.01, contact Applied Instruments for a quote to have it modified.\n2) XR-3 Remote app only works with the XR-3's satellite meter modules.  Support for the cable modules will be coming soon!\n3) Only the XR-3's main Run screen, AZ/EL screens, and limit scan screens are viewable and controllable via the mobile device.  Increased functionality (more screens) will be offered at a later date via software updates.\n4) Only 1 mobile device can be connected to each XR-3 at a time.\n5) WiFi range of iOS mobile device to XR-3 satellite meter varies depending on obstacles and terrain, but is approximately 100 to 300 feet.\n\nWhat do I need to get started?\n1) iPhone or iPad\n2) WiFi Enabled XR-3 Modular Test Instrument (hardware version 3.01) with a related satellite meter module\n\nFor more details about WiFi functions of the WiFi-enabled XR-3, visit http://www.appliedin.com/www/assets/products/XR_3/downloads/XR-3_Meter_WiFi_Operations.pdf\n\nFor more details about the XR-3 Remote iOS app, visit http://www.appliedin.com/www/assets/products/XR_3/downloads/XR-3_Remote_iOS_App.pdf\n\nHow do I link my iOS mobile device to the XR-3?\n1)\tPower on your XR‐3.\n2)\tTurn on Wi‐Fi on your iPhone or iPad if it’s not already enabled.\n3)\tWhen searching on your iOS device for the wireless network that you’d like to join, select the SSID (name) of your\nXR‐3 and enter the password.\n4)\tIn your XR‐3, you can view and modify its related SSID and password by selecting MENU --> WiFi --> \nWiFi Menu --> WiFi Options --> Hands Free Cfg.\n5)\tOn your XR‐3, exit the WiFi menu to return to the meter’s Run screen (where your bar graphs are shown)\n6)\tOn your iPhone or iPad, open the XR‐3 Remote app. The phone will sync with your meter and your meter’s main Run screen display will be mirrored on the phone.\n\nLearn more about the Applied Instruments XR-3 and other Applied Instruments products at www.appliedin.com"

      "label": "Launch your discreet, skillful campaign for power at work: immediately.\n\n“Foundations” is the first in a series of apps that provide discreet, on-the-job training in the Arts of Power: how to acquire, maintain, and expand your power in the workplace. It is based on the New York Times best-selling book, The 48 Laws of Power, by Robert Greene.\n\n**Thousands of successful users from around the world since June 2011**\n\nThis system does not provide you with sugar-coated, politically correct sayings and exercises. Nor does it offer the ubiquitous “secret-formula” for rapid success still used by charlatans to this day.\n\nReal, lasting power is gained by seeing the world clearly (no matter how ugly some of it may be), and by playing the game of power: subtly, skillfully, and in a way that reflects your own uniqueness.\n\nPlay this social game wisely, and not only will you maximize your power, you will do so in a way that is fun AND profoundly reflects who you are.\n\nRemember: power isn’t the problem, powerlessness is.\n\nCONTENTS\nThe Foundations app utilizes:\n- 25 audio sessions + 5 Bonus sessions (approx. 15 min. each, 9hrs in total)\n- 4 Integrated Tools (always accessible)\n- A member’s web site (for home use)\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nIdeally, listen to one audio session on the way to work, as a morning briefing for your day ahead.\n\nWhile you listen, you are given the opportunity to reflect on how various portions of Greene’s text (plus real-world business examples) relate to your situation. Each session ends with a suggested action designed to help you discreetly and skillfully enhance your power that day at work. \n\nEach session also brings you closer to revealing and strengthening the Foundations of your power: the powerful skills, behaviours and perspectives you already have to some degree. Refine these, and it not only increases your power immediately at work, it also gives you the solid base you need to add power-enhancing capabilities that are new to you.\n\nDuring the day you record any observations or planned actions within the four integrated tools.\n\nThe four tools are: \n1) REFLECTOR: Self Assessment\n2) DOSSIER: Analyzing the people you work with\n3) STRATEGY: Your plans to enhance your power\n4) PERSONA: A vision of the most powerful - and sustainable - aspects of your character that you should present to the world\n\nAs you complete each audio session, a new element is released within one of the tools to help you quickly record your observations and strategies.\n\nBy the time you finish the primary 25 sessions, the observations you have made, and strategies you have designed in the four tools, guide you along your own, unique pathway to mastery. Listen to the sessions again and again, or just keep refining and adding to what you’ve entered within the tools.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO OUR V1.X USERS:\nRobert Greene has been following the development and testing of this unique mastery system over the years. It was directly through the insightful feedback from our first generation users - and the endlessly practical wisdom of Greene’s work - that the 5 new bonus sessions 26-30 came to be. \n\nWARNING! Action-based program\nPursuing mastery requires taking real-world action: however since AMS cannot know your exact situation, this app provides you with suggested actions.  These actions are specific enough to be understood, but must be adapted to fit your unique disposition and situation. Therefore, we cannot know what form your final actions will take or be responsible for any consequences.\n\nRest assured however, Mastering The 48 Laws of Power is all about taking wise, subtle action."

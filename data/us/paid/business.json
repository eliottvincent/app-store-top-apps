      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

Whether you work Saturday to Friday or Monday to Sunday, you decide how you manage your time.  \n\nDASHBOARDS\nDo you work multiple projects on a given day? We provide Yearly, Monthly, Weekly, Daily and Custom summaries of your time across all jobs. With advanced filter capability, view your Dashboard your way. Now with the Job dashboard you have an efficient way to swipe through all your jobs for the current day, start / stop time, take a break, add memos and more. \n\nCHARTS\nVisualize your time with Charts. We support Pie Charts, Line Charts and Bar Charts. Want to share your Chart with someone else? We've got that too!\n\nTIME TRACKING\nPause and restart time tracking with the tap of a button. Edit times with a tap or key in your duration. Add new times because you accidentally left your device at home. With shortcuts for Now, Morning, Afternoon, Evening, :00, :15, :30 and :45, changing time is easy and fast. You can even split your time entry and Easy Hours will copy over any tags and memos.\n\nMEMOS\nNeed to keep track of what you did at a particular time on a given day? Easy Hours allows you to attach notes that you can use to remind yourself.\n\nTAGS\nTag your times with keywords such as \"paid\", \"holiday\" or \"lunch break\". Multiple tags can be applied to a time entry and you can re-use tags. Tags can also be applied in bulk to a set of time entries filtered by date range, jobs and/or tags.\n\nFILTERING\nMore powerful filtering that works hand in gloves with your tags. Filter using Jobs, Tags or any combination of both. Sharing uses Filters just like you would expect too.\n\nCLOUD BACKUP & SYNCHRONIZATION\nStart tracking your time on one device and continue on another all with iCloud. Worried about data loss? Easy Hours can automatically backup your data to iCloud and synchronize it with your other devices. \n\nCOLORS\nUse colors to uniquely customize your jobs and your reports.\n\nROUNDING\nDo you prefer round numbers when calculating your total hours? Personalize your timesheet to calculate your total hours exactly as you want it.\n\nCURRENCY\nUse a different currency to bill your clients? We provide support for most currency combinations with the exception of Federation and Galactic Credits.\n\nLANDSCAPE\nUnlike some of our competitors, yes we support landscape! Go on and rotate your device, we dare you!\n\n3D TOUCH\nFor those with compatible devices, 3D Touch has been incorporated to make usage more fun and exciting. Use 3D Touch to jump to your Weekly, Monthly, Custom Dashboards or Charts.\n\nCLOCK IN/OUT NOTIFICATIONS\nConfigurable notifications when you clock in and clock out of a location.  Let Easy Hours free you up from having to constantly track your time in spreadsheets or notes. Notifications will provide you with the confidence that your time is being tracked with precision.\n\nSHARE TIME\nWith the convenience of sharing you can let anyone, including yourself, know exactly how long you have been working on a task. The export has that great look and feel you expect, too. You can even personalize it by choosing a color theme, your Name and Organization, export format (HTML or CSV) and whether to include individual time entries. \n\nPERSONALIZED DAILY REMINDERS\nEasy Hours lets you decide if you’ve spent too much time on a task.  It is smart enough to know when you should call it a day. We provide personalized reminders instead of the usual plain old notifications."

      "label": "Introducing the Langelier Saturation Index Calculator app for iOS – the ultimate tool for pool owners and professionals. With this app, you can easily and accurately calculate the Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) of your pool water, ensuring that your pool is always properly balanced and healthy for swimmers.\n\nThe Langelier Saturation Index is a measure of the balance between the calcium and alkalinity levels in your pool water. A balanced pool will have an LSI of 0, while a pool with too much calcium will have a positive LSI, and a pool with too little calcium will have a negative LSI. By regularly calculating the LSI of your pool water, you can ensure that it is always properly balanced and safe for swimmers.\n\nUsing the LSI Calculator app is simple: just enter the pH, temperature, total alkalinity, and calcium hardness levels of your pool water, and the app will provide you with an instant calculation of the LSI. You can even save your calculations and track the LSI of your pool over time to monitor changes and make adjustments as needed.\n\nThe LSI Calculator app is a must-have for anyone who wants to keep their pool water healthy and balanced. With its easy-to-use interface and accurate calculations, you'll be able to maintain a safe and enjoyable pool environment for you and your family. Download the app today and take control of your pool's water chemistry.\n\nAlso, water temperature can be entered as Fahrenheit or Celsius. \n\nThis app features: \n\n• Send your calculations or conversions by email \n• Universal App (iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad)\n• Retina Display graphics \n• Fast app switching \n• Automatically Saves Your Inputs \n• Latest version of iOS is supported\n• All iPhone and iPad screens sizes are supported\n• Export to CSV\n\nNo network connectivity required."

The PV/COLA calculator estimates the total Future Value (FV) / PV / COLA for a given percentage of disability between 70-100% based on Age at time of first payment, Date of Injury, and inputted PV discount rate / COLA inflation rate / PV Rate Discount Compound.\n- Additionally, the CompCalc Plus includes the option with a tap of the screen to turn on or off the Combined Value Equation when multiple rating strings are involved. When the Combined Value Equation is turned off the adjusted PD for each rating string is aggregated rather than combined using the Combined Value Equation.\n- It also includes a full PD rating schedule which automatically creates a rating string adjusting the WPI given the Part of Body, Age, Occupation, and DFEC. The Plus version also incorporates a relational database for Occupation and Part of Body making input intuitive and simple.\n- It has a Combined Vale Equation Module which computes CVE percentage and total indemnity given percentage numbers, DOI, AWW or PD Rate (defaulting to max). \n- The user has an option to override default TD/PD indemnity rate in all screens (always bounded by min and max values).\n- The user can print, store or send the e-mail of COLA calculations.\n\nThe CompCalc Plus includes a California Workers' Compensation Indemnity Calculator that calculates:\n- Permanent Disability.\n- Temporary Disability.\n- Life Pension.\n- Life Expectancy given the current age and based upon the 2008 / 2010 U.S. Life Tables as provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n- Supplemental Job Displacement Benefits.\n- and Death Benefits, for the given date of industrial injury.\n\nIt also calculates TD liability for a given period based on the default max weekly rate for the date of industrial injury or a TD rate based on AWW manually imputed.\n\nOther features also include a Date Calculator, full listing of QME/Body Codes, and full access to support and training videos.\n\nAll Users of the CompCalc are instructed to consult the specific provisions of the California Labor Code and/or the DEU to ensure the accuracy of the information provided.

It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "SalesCalc is designed to help you to create irresistible deals\n- quickly \n- efficiently\n- accurately\nwithout having to remember formulas and equations\n\nAnyone can use it - it's really so simple.\nAll you need is an iPhone.\n\nIf you need to calculate:\n- Gross Margin\n- Markup %\n- Percent Change\n- Percent Total\nthen SalesCalc is the App for you. \n\n\nMost people in sales and purchasing rely on their favorite spreadsheets when they want to calculate margins, markups or discounts. Some folks have memorized the formulas and use a calculator for the task but we think that the iPhone presents an easier way to get the answers you need to close a deal quickly. Instead of having to remember formulas - you'll never make a mistake with SalesCalc.\n\nSalesCalc will deliver your answer in under a second, all you need to do is input numerical values into 2 of the 3 fields. To clear the fields, just shake the iPhone.\n\nSalesCalc puts a few of the most commonly used sales related calculations in the palm of your hand so the next time you are in deal making mode - reach out for SalesCalc and put together the best deal ever.\n\nHere's to your Sales Success... \n \n\nSome Definitions:\n- Gross Margin is the percentage of the selling price that can be applied toward covering your operating costs and profit. Basically, 20% gross profit margin means that for every dollar generated in sales, you have 20 cents left over to cover basic operating costs and profit. \nLarger gross margins are generally good for companies, with the exception of discount retailers which need to show that operation efficiency and financing allows them to operate with smaller margins. Since the Margin is the percentage of the price that is markup, it can never exceed 100%\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold includes variable and fixed costs directly linked to the product, such as material and labor. It does not include indirect fixed costs like office expenses, rent, administrative costs, etc.\n\n- Markup also known as Cost-Plus-Markup or Markup by Cost is the difference between the selling price and the cost divided by the cost of goods sold expressed as a percent. The initial markup of a retail product is also known as IMU. \n\n- Markdowns or Discounts are used to generate sales and or clear inventory and are usually expressed as a percentage of the Original Price.\n\n- Initial pricing is an extremely important step in merchandising. For retailers that use a traditional calculation, such as Keystoning, which is doubling cost to arrive at the selling price (100% IMU = 50% profit margin), this may or may not be adequate to be profitable, particularly after markdowns are taken. In reality, there are numerous examples of products that cannot be sold profitably, but need to be in the store to satisfy Customer needs. Therefore, other products need to be sold at higher MU%'s to cover the net losses of the products that lose money. SalesCalc gives you a few ways to price your products so that you can calculate your profitability using the method that best fits your business model."

Up until this moment, iPhones can only read links without help from additional apps. Our app will generate and give you a short link that you can then write on your card. When used, the link will open the native phone app to save the contact.\n\nApart from contacts, you can also write links & texts. Even multiple entries on one card.\n\nThe app has a history section that will show you all the entries used by you in the past. From here you can reuse the entries to make your life easier if you need to write multiple cards. Also from here, you can permanently remove any data that we have about you."

      "label": "A Bíblia King James de 1611 é descrita como uma das publicações mais importantes da história, e também a mais fiel ao Textus Receptus. O rei James I da Inglaterra reuniu os maiores estudiosos religiosos e linguistas para uma nova tradução da Bíblia, a fim de estabelecer a tradução mais precisa e mais digna até à data. Ele nomeou 54 estudiosos para trabalhar na tradução, e 47 trabalharam em seis grupos em três locais por sete anos.\r\n\r\nApós a conclusão, a Bíblia King James foi impressa pela primeira vez em 1611 por Robert Barker. A Bíblia era muito grande, cerca de 40cm de altura. Por causa do alto custo e valor, foi anunciado para as igrejas que a Bíblia devia ser acorrentada nos púlpitos.\r\n\r\nA Bíblia 1611 foi autorizada para ser lida nas igrejas, razão pela qual foi chamada de Versão Autorizada. Enfim, nós da BV Books estamos felizes em poder apresentar, a Versão Autorizada em português da Bíblia King James."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

The iOS mobile device connects to the XR-3 satellite meter using WiFi technology without using any 4G data and without going through the internet.\n\nApplication example: Connect your XR-3 satellite meter at the ground block location and power on the XR-3.  Then pair your XR-3 to your iOS mobile device via WiFi.  Climb the ladder with your phone on an armband, run the XR-3 Remote app, and check signal level and quality and re-align your satellite dish without having to first remove the LNBF head and temporarily connect short coax jumper cables from the LNBF to your satellite meter.  The XR-3 meter's screen is mirrored on your mobile device, allowing you to identify the satellite, toggle to different satellites and transponders and measure RF level, demodulated signal quality, and LNB LO drift.  This method offers safety and speed advantages for the satellite technician.\n\nPresent Limitations:\n1) Only works with XR-3 hardware version 3.01 (XR-3's with optional WiFi hardware module installed).  To confirm the hardware version of your XR-3, press MENU, select Versions from the Main Menu and refer to the Base HW Version field.  If your XR-3 doesn't have hardware version 3.01, contact Applied Instruments for a quote to have it modified.\n2) XR-3 Remote app only works with the XR-3's satellite meter modules.  Support for the cable modules will be coming soon!\n3) Only the XR-3's main Run screen, AZ/EL screens, and limit scan screens are viewable and controllable via the mobile device.  Increased functionality (more screens) will be offered at a later date via software updates.\n4) Only 1 mobile device can be connected to each XR-3 at a time.\n5) WiFi range of iOS mobile device to XR-3 satellite meter varies depending on obstacles and terrain, but is approximately 100 to 300 feet.\n\nWhat do I need to get started?\n1) iPhone or iPad\n2) WiFi Enabled XR-3 Modular Test Instrument (hardware version 3.01) with a related satellite meter module\n\nFor more details about WiFi functions of the WiFi-enabled XR-3, visit http://www.appliedin.com/www/assets/products/XR_3/downloads/XR-3_Meter_WiFi_Operations.pdf\n\nFor more details about the XR-3 Remote iOS app, visit http://www.appliedin.com/www/assets/products/XR_3/downloads/XR-3_Remote_iOS_App.pdf\n\nHow do I link my iOS mobile device to the XR-3?\n1)\tPower on your XR‐3.\n2)\tTurn on Wi‐Fi on your iPhone or iPad if it’s not already enabled.\n3)\tWhen searching on your iOS device for the wireless network that you’d like to join, select the SSID (name) of your\nXR‐3 and enter the password.\n4)\tIn your XR‐3, you can view and modify its related SSID and password by selecting MENU --> WiFi --> \nWiFi Menu --> WiFi Options --> Hands Free Cfg.\n5)\tOn your XR‐3, exit the WiFi menu to return to the meter’s Run screen (where your bar graphs are shown)\n6)\tOn your iPhone or iPad, open the XR‐3 Remote app. The phone will sync with your meter and your meter’s main Run screen display will be mirrored on the phone.\n\nLearn more about the Applied Instruments XR-3 and other Applied Instruments products at www.appliedin.com"

      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

Press power button, you can see signal strength bar moving, then slide the thumb to set the threshold (0.00~1.00), the value will be saved for next time use. \n\n2.If the indicator start flashing, that means a real recording start. check the recorded files,some test files can be found  there . \n\n3.In each scenario, the threshold value could be different, set it according to the situation. For example,for snoring and dream talk recording at night, set the value to 0.05, but at daytime, you probably have to set it at 0.10. \n\n4. Attention for naming a label: all files can be saved to your computer. Label,as a part of a file name, has to follow some rules for different computer OS.For this app, make it simple as follows,the name length is better to be limited to within 125 characters,as for the kind of characters, for Windows,you can't use ?\\|/ etc. in your label, otherwise iTunes will report a error such as no files found, just rename it as windows' requirement to fix it.\n\n\n**About Volume**\nSpeaker mode or earphone mode,  the speaker hardware is shared by all apps in your device, please check both modes and adjust the volume if you can't hear anything.\n\n**How to download recording files**\nFor file downloading,  iTunes File sharing Feature is recommended.  The basic steps : connect to iTunes->click \"iPhone\" ->click \"App\"->scroll down to find \"File sharing\"->click this app's icon -> select recording fils on the right box ->click \" Save\". You can also find more details in the help section of iTunes."

Swiftly auto dial through intelligently sorted call lists, review detailed analytics of call sessions, and swiftly take follow-up actions without ever leaving the app. Make phone calls without having to dial a number into a keypad. SwiftCall is the way call time was meant to be.\n\nCollaboration is key, and SwiftCall makes it easy to make sales calls as a team with lead sharing and analytics reporting. Stop maintaining that disorganized spreadsheet or scanning your eyes between a notepad and a phone. If you've been calling over 25, 50, or even 100 leads per day, get ready for SwiftCall to completely transform your sales process.\n\nCall Lists:\nManage the lead pipeline intelligently from first contact through close. Create leads or import a CSV with thousands of them and then SwiftCall will do the work of sorting them into call lists. SwiftCall tracks progress with each lead as you call to determine which ones are more promising. \n\nNo need to restart data entry for leads: import a CSV with hundreds or even thousands of leads within seconds. Share leads easily between SwiftCallers to work together as a team.\n\nAnalytics & Achievements:\nIf you can't measure, you can't manage. That's why SwiftCall keeps track of progress from the analytics Dashboard. View charts with calls, deals, and revenue per day. It’s like a fitness tracker for business growth. Review call logs and achievements earned to measure long-term performance. Create reports from the Dashboard to show off your performance to the team.\n\nFollow-Up Actions:\nCall time doesn’t just stop with the call. You want to stay fresh in the mind of your lead so they know that their time is valued. That’s why SwiftCall can quickly send follow-up emails or text messages as a follow-up. The Planner then helps schedule the next call and creates notifications for when the time comes to call again. If you have it enabled, Siri Suggestions will also prompt you right before your scheduled call, allowing you to tap the notification to dial in.\n\nMaybe you are hustling to build your business, or perhaps you work on a sales team with big dreams. Maybe you are a fundraiser at a non profit. Regardless of where you come from, we are here to help.

Profiles can be saved and edited and include state, marital status, pay period, allowances and deductions information.\n\n8 pre-tax or post-tax deductions\n-----------------------------------------\nPayrollguru app allows up to 8 pre-tax and/or post-tax deductions, which are setup as a fixed amount deduction or a % of gross pay. Deductions are customizable and can differ from one profile to another. The deductions can be modified to accommodate various taxing scenarios. For example for 401K deduction - select pretax and turn ON Federal and State switches to exclude it from being taxed on federal and state levels.\n\nOnce you enter all information and include year-to-date gross paid wages, Payroll Guru will calculate your net paycheck amount and will show you the appropraite taxes.\n\nPayroll Guru calculates the following taxes: \n- Federal WIthholding, \n- Social Security, \n- Medicare, \n- State Withholding, \n- State Unemployment (where applicable), \n- State Disability Insurance (where applicable). \n\nCalculated paychecks can be viewed as a pie chart showing the percentage distribution of your gross pay.

In fact, our software powers the analysis capabilities of major Autodesk (The makers of AutoCAD) software tools such as Autodesk Revit. \n\nThe following is just a small sample of the features included in this app:\n\n1. Calculations based upon abridged ACCA Manual J8 calculations (This is not an ACCA-approved app. For our ACCA-approved iPad app, search for the HVAC ResLoad-J app on the app store)\n\n2. Includes a 1000+ world-wide city weather database\n\n3. Includes data for 100s of construction types for walls, roofs, floors, doors, windows, skylights, ceilings, and more\n\n4. Allows you to create and store an unlimited number of projects\n\n5. Allows you to create an unlimited number of rooms and view individual loads and airflows for those rooms\n\n6. Allows you to specify an unlimited # of opaque types (ie – doors, walls, roofs, floors, ceilings), window types, and skylight types for each building\n\n7. Allows you to instantly view total heating and cooling load results as you update input data\n\n8. Allows you to view comprehensive cooling and heating load breakdown reports including breakdown by opaque load, window load, skylight load, infiltration load, ventilation load and internal load contributions\n\n9. Opaque inputs include opaque type, opaque construction number, dimensions, and opening areas\n\n10. Window inputs include window type, internal and external shading type, overhang dimensions, window area, and more..\n\n11. Additional input types include # of people, # of bedrooms, ventilation airflow, and more..\n\n12. Includes ability to display a wide variety of on-screen reports including checksum reports (ie – BTUh/SqFt, SqFt/Ton, etc.), complete heating and cooling load breakdown reports, and even graphically-pleasing pie charts showing cooling and heating load breakdowns\n\n13. Includes the ability to display a comprehensive HTML report that you can email to yourself or others, and it also includes a spreadsheet attachment that you can open in Excel to further massage data on your desktop\n\n14. Includes English (IP) or Metric (SI) units\n\n15. This is the same technology that powers the Trane MAP iPad app that they offer to their elite dealer network\n\nThe benefits of using this app are numerous including:\n\n1. Great for use out in the field. Quickly size heating and cooling equipment, show the client, then email the results back to your office for further analysis.\n\n2. Show off your advanced on-screen reports to clients convincing them you are using cutting-edge technology\n\n3. Save time by inputting information in the field and then returning to your office to perform more in-depth analysis"

It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14.

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

Using AES encryption, you can rest easy knowing your data is safe and secure.\n\n• Import, Export, Share: It’s easy to import your data from existing files, so getting started is a breeze. Import your data from text, CSV, Bento and more.

      "label": "A must have for Professional Snow Plowers!  Plus it keeps getting better with each update!  Get the edge over your competition.\n\nHow long do you have to snow plow to pay for this app?  Minutes!  Think of it as less than the cost of (2) bags of ice melt or roughly 5% of a new cutting edge on your plow .  Think of it as the cheapest thing you will buy for your snow removal business besides the snacks at the gas station.  \n\nRead everything below to understand why it's worth purchasing....\n\nSnowClient was created by someone that has been in your shoes (snow boots), snow plowing through the night to have the properties clear by morning.\n\nThink about it!  No more clipboards, paper, and handwriting.  Handwriting that is hard to read and takes forever to organize to be able to invoice snow customers after the snow storm is over.  All the while you are hoping that your paperwork notes don't blow away, fall in the snow, or get stolen.  Then how are you supposed to know what hours to bill for and all the other information that was on that piece of paper?  The SnowClient app takes care of all of this.  \n\nWith SnowClient it is easy to document all the work you do and have it immediately organized and accessible in case your snow removal clients want to know when you serviced their property or how deep the snow was when you did service it.  You will have the info at your fingertips and will impress them with your ability to know the facts on the spot.\n\nNo more hours spent calculating your hours for each property to know what to put on the invoice.  It is done the moment you finish servicing the snow account and push stop.\n\nThen when invoicing, all you do is use the sort feature to filter by property and you have all the information you need to invoice for that specific property!\n\nYou can also sort by date and team leader (this could be the driver).\n\nAlso if you put the full address into the property info you or your employees can just click on it to get directions to that property.\n\nSimplify your snow business and minimize the headaches & work after the snow storm.   \n\nSnowClient Helps You Keep Track of:\n\n- Property Names\n\n- Property Details (Address, Deadline Time, Etc.)\n\n- Time Spent Working at Each Property\n\n- Employee Information (if needed)\n\n- Amounts of Salt or De-icing Materials Used at Each Property to be Billed for Later\n\n- Additional Notes - Write Notes and Other Messages That Are Unique to Your Company's Way of Doing Business or Other Information You Would Like but There is no Spot For it.\n\n- Which Employees Serviced Which Properties\n(Employees on the job)\n\nSnowClient Also Will:\n\n- Assist in Accurate Billing\n\n- Keep Work Information Organized\n\n- Create Documentation to Help in Legal Matters\n\n- And So Much More in the Future!\n\n***What this app does NOT do:\n\n- Store Your Information in the Cloud (all the info is stored on your phone)\n\n- Login for Different Users or Privileges\n\n- Sync Information Across Different Users Devices \n\n- Export to Excel or Quickbooks BUT there IS exporting (text, email, etc.)\n\n- Print (unless you export to notes then you can print from notes)\n\nWe know there are probably a lot more features including the ones listed under \"What this app is not\" that you would like to be able to have to help you manage your snow removal properties, snow removal employees, and snow removal customers.  \n\nPLEASE share your ideas with us so we can incorporate them into the app to better serve your needs.  We want to make sure you are satisfied!  We would like to see all 5 Star Reviews so help us out and give us feedback before slamming us with a bad review.  If your life is better because of this app then give us a good review:)  As snow plowers we know what it is like to only hear complaints and on the other side how good it feels when somebody appreciates the work we performed.\n\nSend us a message on our Facebook page by following the Support Link.  We are here for you!"

Profiles can be saved and edited and include state, marital status, pay period, allowances and deductions information.\n\n8 pre-tax or post-tax deductions\n-----------------------------------------\nPayrollguru app allows up to 8 pre-tax and/or post-tax deductions, which are setup as a fixed amount deduction or a % of gross pay. Deductions are customizable and can differ from one profile to another. The deductions can be modified to accommodate various taxing scenarios. For example for 401K deduction - select pretax and turn ON Federal and State switches to exclude it from being taxed on federal and state levels.\n\nOnce you enter all information and include year-to-date gross paid wages, Payroll Guru will calculate your net paycheck amount and will show you the appropraite taxes.\n\nPayroll Guru calculates the following taxes: \n- Federal WIthholding, \n- Social Security, \n- Medicare, \n- State Withholding, \n- State Unemployment (where applicable), \n- State Disability Insurance (where applicable). \n\nCalculated paychecks can be viewed as a pie chart showing the percentage distribution of your gross pay. Paycheck details can be emailed to an employee, employer or a payroll service provider. \n\nPayrollguru app is a must have for any self-employed person or employer in the US to calculate paychecks and verify accuracy of issued paychecks. \n\nPayrollguru app will also be useful to any employee looking to improve financial planning, budget spending and estimate impact of personal changes (i.e. marital status, number of dependents) on net take home amount. \n\nEmployees can also use Payroll Guru app to compare net paycheck amounts (after tax) in different states. This will be useful for employees considering job or relocation to a different state.  \n\nFor small business owners and payroll service providers Payrollguru will help estimate net and gross paycheck amounts in a particular payroll situation, and will provide a pretty accurate assessment of applicable payroll taxes.\n\nPayrollguru app calculates payroll taxes for all 50 states and District of Columbia. \n\nIf you have any improvement suggestions or would like to report a problem please email us directly at support@payrollguru.mobi. \n\nWe also appreciate your positive feedback and reviews.

      "label": "VIN Inventory is a quick VIN lookup tool that allows you to save your vehicles’ details and photos. Scan a VIN barcode in just a few seconds using the autofocus camera on your iPhone 4S and newer. Or enter the VIN using the keyboard.\n\nThis app was created for automotive professionals such as dealership managers and salespeople, as well as car enthusiasts and anyone who wants to keep a list of vehicles with photos.\n\nNo subscription, in-app purchase or decoding fee is required to use the full features of VIN Inventory.\n\nVIN Inventory quickly authenticates and then decodes the vehicle VIN (serial number) and displays rich details including year, make, model, engine, equipment and optional accessory items. The user may add stock number (or tag number), color, odometer reading, price, and a note about the car. 3 photos can be added using the iPhone camera or Camera Roll. Equipment items can be added or changed. The user may choose to either add the vehicle to their saved inventory list or delete the vehicle after a quick review. Previously saved vehicle data can be edited or deleted from the list and photos can be updated.\n\nThe Vehicle List display screen is a scrolling table of all saved vehicles complete with your thumbnail photos. You can email a text file of ALL of the vehicles in your list. Tapping on a specific vehicle causes a Detail View to be displayed with vehicle specifications, equipment options and vehicle photos.\nTap on a photo to see an enlarged image of the vehicle. \n\nSend an email of a single vehicle that includes all of the vehicle info and 3 photos.\n\nVIN Inventory accepts vehicles produced after 1981 (17 digit VINs). Data coverage is for North American vehicles and omits data for exotic vehicles and older vehicles that are not commonly found on dealership car lots.\n\nAutoPlus produces other vehicle inventory tools with such features as upload, download, import, and export of vehicle data, multiple photos, label printing and other powerful functions.\n\nThis VIN Inventory app is an extension of our 20-year-old AutoPlus Window Sticker business (a division of Tanner Communications).

The unique data entry GUI employing sliders and buttons improves upon the more typical keypad pad mechanism.\n\nHowever, there is a keypad data entry option that allows for numbers greater than +1000 and less than -1000, including number with two decimal place accuracy.\n\nInternal rate of return can be computed over 1 to 12 years for the quick slider input option and over 1 to 20 years for the extended keypad input option.\n\nAlthough periodic amounts are shown as yearly amounts, the user may interpret these as generic periodic amounts. For example, each amount could be considered a quarterly amount and the IRR computed would be interpreted as the return based on that frequency as well.\n\nThe iPad version allows you to add, retrieve, reorder, or delete data sets. It also displays a graph of the present value of the cash flows discounted at various rates between 0% and 25%."

      "label": "The NPC LSI Calc is the newest, most advanced and most accurate calculator for determining the Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) for swimming pool and spa water. It was developed by noted pool and spa water chemistry expert and author, Robert W. Lowry. It is the only LSI calculator that currently has exact adjustments for cyanuric acid and borate.\n\nThe LSI is used to predict if pool or spa water is corrosive, balanced or scaling. The NPC LSI Calc uses the original mathematical equations which use logarithms, square roots, and interpolated constants for calculations. We do not use inaccurate lookup tables and factors. The actual water test results are used for calculations. \n\nThe NPC LSI Calc is easy to use, you input the customer or pool name and then the water test results for pH, Total Alkalinity (TA), Cyanuric Acid (CYA) Borate (B) Calcium Hardness (CH), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and the water Temperature (T) in degrees Fahrenheit. The LSI with adjustments is automatically calculated and displayed. The background color of the LSI value changes from green to amber to red depending on whether the water is Corrosive, Acceptable, Ideal, or Scaling. This gives a visual or at a glance notice of the water’s condition.\n\nThe original LSI was never intended for predicting corrosive, balanced or scaling water conditions for pools or spas. In fact, it was developed in 1936 which was many years before the development of Cyanuric Acid (CYA) which became popular around 1960 and remains so. The very popular trichlor chlorine tablets actually contain 56 % CYA and so as chlorine is dispensed, the CYA builds up in the water. CYA has a direct influence on Total Alkalinity (TA) so an adjustment had to be made to the original LSI calculation. \n\nAnother family of chemicals that have become popular recently as a pH buffer and algaestat in swimming pool and spa water are borates. Borates also have an influence of TA. Using borates in pool or spa water keeps the pH from rising but also requires an adjustment to TA and therefore has an effect on the LSI calculation too.\n\nWe have determined the exact affect borate and CYA will have on LSI calculations and built in the mathematical adjustments to the NPC LSI Calc App.\n\nThe goal mathematically is to have an LSI of near 0.00 but any value from –0.30 to + 0.50 is either Acceptable or Ideal. Positive values show increasing tendencies for forming scale and values more than +0.50 indicate scaling water conditions that require action. Negative values show increasing tendencies for being corrosive or aggressive and values greater than –0.30 indicate corrosive water that requires action.\n\nWe do not recommend which water conditions to change or chemical amounts to adjust the water balance or LSI. Which condition to adjust is best accomplished by the service tech, pool owner or pool store. There may be reasons that one condition or another cannot be changed or perhaps a condition is easier to change than another. But you can input new amounts for any condition to see what affect it will have on LSI.\n\nResults can be saved and reviewed. The number of records saved is only limited by your phone’s memory. It is easy to delete of records.\n\nProtecting the pool or spa surface, plumbing and equipment and having balanced water for your customers, your family or guests are easy with the NPC LSI Calc."

      "label": "The Liberty Item Entry App is designed to allow users of Resaleworld's popular Liberty software to enter and update inventory while on the go. Accounts can be added and updated as well. This app allows store employees to move to wherever they need to be with the convenience of a mobile device, while still having the ability access and enter information.This app helps improve productivity and helps to overcome a number of logistical challenges. The Item Entry App is ideal for the following scenarios: adding photographs to large amounts of new or existing inventory; adding large furniture which is difficult to relocate to a PC with a full installation of Liberty software; traveling to estate sales to add inventory; adding and updating inventory stored in a warehouse.\n\nThe item entry interface includes several design features that are optimized for a touch-screen, smaller display for popular mobile devices. A list of the 20 most commonly used categories speeds up item entry considerably. A graphical trend analysis tool calculates and displays pricing information based on the category and brand of the item being entered, based on the past year's sales data. Adding photographs to items is simple and quick both when using images from the device's photo library or when taking new pictures with the device's camera.  This app also allows users to print tags for inventory, to email item lists directly to accountholders, and to view an account's transaction history.\n\nThis app requires an installation Liberty Software (Liberty REACT, Liberty 5, Liberty 4 Consignment, or Liberty 4 Trading Assistants) and either a qualifying Web Service plan or a stand-alone Liberty Mobile Access license. Please contact Resaleworld with any questions about Liberty Mobile Access eligibility."

      "label": "I started off selling small handmade items on various sites.  Initially, I struggled with pricing.  How do you balance costs, while at the same time making a decent profit.  To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

      "label": "Make your job easier with our refrigerant charging and diagnostic HVAC app - HVAC Buddy®. If you are servicing equipment the best way to begin diagnosis and determine the proper refrigerant charge is to use HVAC Buddy®, a set of gauges, and a thermometer.\n\n • Superheat for fixed capillary or Subcooling forTXV/EXV systems\n • Calculates targeted vs. actual Subcooling \n • Over 100 refrigerants including newer azeotropic blends\n • Airflow / Delta-T / TEET Calculation\n • Email System Status Report\n • Imperial (IP) or Metric (SI)\n • Use Target Superheat and Subcooling tables or enter manually\n • Update all values with realtime output\n • Line Chart displays historical values based on input changes or elapsed time\n\nIf the early outdoor temperature is 75F and you charge the system to a “beer can cold” suction line your system is likely improperly charged.  Later in the afternoon high temperatures will increase head pressure and the resulting overcharge means a lower than desired superheat and wasted energy.  Not good!\n\nOverall Process:\n\n • Enter refrigerant, temps, and pressures\n • The math is done for you to display Superheat, Subcooling and Airflow Target, Actual, and Difference\n • Email all readings (detail)\n\nOther Features:\n\n • Flexible units - psi, kPa, Fahrenheit, Celsius, etc.\n • Calculates Superheat and Subcooling targets\n • Airflow - For cooling, compares a targeted difference across the coil vs. actual.  Also called Delta-T or Target Evaporator Exit Temperature (TEET).\n • System Status Report - Use the email tab to create defaults for email addresses, subject, and System Status Report introductory text.  Tap the email button and these values are incorporated into a formatted page including all the parameters recorded in HVAC Buddy.   Edit the email and / or add contacts from your contact list.  Then on each service call it's just a couple taps to send a personalized report.\n\nAccolades and Awards:\n----------------------------\nHVAC Buddy® ranked #2 in ContractingBusiness.com readers choice of top 10 contracting apps.\n\nHVAC Buddy® was featured by the California Association of HERS Raters and is CalHERS approved!\n\n\"Very cool app.  I can see California really running with this as we have strict requirements for verification.\" - John Richau, Executive Director, Calhers\n\n\"an excellent programme\" - Charlie Richards\n\nHVAC Buddy® Load Calc - Now Available\n\nHVAC Buddy® Duct Calc - Powerful tool with a simple to use real-time interface to help you choose optimal duct sizes.\n\nHVAC Buddy® Pressure Temperature - Over 90 Refrigerant combinations and their corresponding PT relationship in Metric or Imperial units.\n\nHVAC Buddy® Psychrometric - Quickly calculate thermodynamic properties of moist air at temperatures commonly used in HVAC systems.

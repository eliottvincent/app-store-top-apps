Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

For Hourly calculation please enter rate and hours (OT, DT) and the Gross Pay amount will be automatically calculated!\n-----------------------------------------\n\nUnlimited profiles \n-----------------------------------------\nPayroll Guru app allows for unlimited number of profiles to cover every employee or a group of similarly taxed employees. Profiles can be saved and edited and include state, marital status, pay period, allowances and deductions information.\n\n8 pre-tax or post-tax deductions\n-----------------------------------------\nPayrollguru app allows up to 8 pre-tax and/or post-tax deductions, which are setup as a fixed amount deduction or a % of gross pay. Deductions are customizable and can differ from one profile to another. The deductions can be modified to accommodate various taxing scenarios. For example for 401K deduction - select pretax and turn ON Federal and State switches to exclude it from being taxed on federal and state levels.\n\nOnce you enter all information and include year-to-date gross paid wages, Payroll Guru will calculate your net paycheck amount and will show you the appropraite taxes.\n\nPayroll Guru calculates the following taxes: \n- Federal WIthholding, \n- Social Security, \n- Medicare, \n- State Withholding, \n- State Unemployment (where applicable), \n- State Disability Insurance (where applicable). \n\nCalculated paychecks can be viewed as a pie chart showing the percentage distribution of your gross pay. Paycheck details can be emailed to an employee, employer or a payroll service provider. \n\nPayrollguru app is a must have for any self-employed person or employer in the US to calculate paychecks and verify accuracy of issued paychecks. \n\nPayrollguru app will also be useful to any employee looking to improve financial planning, budget spending and estimate impact of personal changes (i.e. marital status, number of dependents) on net take home amount. \n\nEmployees can also use Payroll Guru app to compare net paycheck amounts (after tax) in different states. This will be useful for employees considering job or relocation to a different state.  \n\nFor small business owners and payroll service providers Payrollguru will help estimate net and gross paycheck amounts in a particular payroll situation, and will provide a pretty accurate assessment of applicable payroll taxes.\n\nPayrollguru app calculates payroll taxes for all 50 states and District of Columbia. \n\nIf you have any improvement suggestions or would like to report a problem please email us directly at support@payrollguru.mobi. \n\nWe also appreciate your positive feedback and reviews.

      "label": "The NATE Toolkit+ app was developed by Carmel Software for North American Technical Excellence, Inc. (NATE). This app is the essential app for anyone in the HVAC industry. It is a compilation of most of the individual iPhone and iPad applications offered by Carmel Software plus bonus software.\n\nIf you bought each of these apps separately, it would cost more than 2 times what the price of this app is. It includes:\n\n1. HVAC Residential Load Calc HD (iPad version)\n1. HVAC Residential Load Calcs (iPhone version)\n1. HVAC Equipment Locator\n2. HVAC PT Chart\n3. HVAC Refrigerant Charge\n4. HVAC Duct Sizer\n2. HVAC Quick Load\n6. ASHRAE Ventilation Calcs (iPhone version)\n7. Psychrometrics\n8. Steam Tables\n9. HVAC Pipe Sizer - Liquid\n10. HVAC Pipe Sizer - Steam\n11. HVAC Pipe Sizer - Gas Low\n12. HVAC Pipe Sizer - Gas High\n\nThe \"HVAC Residential Load Calcs\" module allows you to perform comprehensive HVAC block and room-by-room load calculations for small commercial and residential buildings. You can easily use this module out in the field by taking advantage of the simplicity and power of the iPhone or iPad, and then email results back to your office.\n\nThe \"HVAC Equipment Locator\" module allows you to track, share, and customize your equipment nameplate and maintenance data. The version here includes the ability to customize your input screens (this is an in-app purchase on the free stand-alone version of Locator).\n\nThe \"HVAC PT Chart\" module allows you to easily view the pressure-temperature properties of 75 refrigerants. Think of this app as a digital version of the paper PT charts that you may have carried around with you in the past.\n\nThe \"HVAC Refrigerant Charge\" module allows you to perform superheat and subcool refrigerant charge calculations on-the-fly. This app includes pressure-temperature data for over 75 common refrigerants.\n\nThe \"HVAC Duct Sizer\" module allows you to perform quick and simple duct sizing analysis. You can specify the total airflow in CFM (or L/s), the aspect ratio and one of either the velocity of air or the friction loss per 100 feet (30 meters). The results include both the exact and rounded height and width (or diameter) dimensions and the calculated velocity and friction loss. In addition, you can calculate for a range of duct sizes by specifying minimum and maximum friction loss and airflow values. \n\nThe \"HVAC Quick Load\" module allows you to quickly calculate total heating and cooling loads for a wide variety of building types.\n\nThe \"Psychrometrics\" module allows you to easily perform single-state and mixed-air HVAC psychrometric calculations for up to 23 different combinations of input parameters.\n\nThe \"Steam Tables\" module allows you to calculate the properties of saturated or superheated steam by specifying 2 input properties. This module is also part of the \"Pipe Sizer - Steam\" module discussed below.\n\nThe \"ASHRAE Ventilation Calcs\" module allows you to perform comprehensive minimum ventilation calculations for a wide variety of commercial buildings based upon ASHRAE Standard 62.11-2007 and 2010 versions.\n\nThe \"HVAC Pipe Sizer - Liquid\" module allows you to size a pipe run for many different types of liquids (or fluids), pipe material and fitting types.\n\nThe \"HVAC Pipe Sizer - Steam\" module allows you to size a steam pipe run, and it also includes a bonus steam table calculator.\n\nThe \"HVAC Pipe Sizer - Gas Low and Gas High\" modules allows you to quickly size a simple low (less than or equal to 1.5 psi) and high (greater than 1.5 psi) pressure gas piping system by inputting a number of piping and gas properties.\n\nAll values can be displayed in English (IP) and Metric (SI) units.\n\nWe also offer all of the above modules as individual apps, too."

      "label": "A must have for Professional Snow Plowers!  Plus it keeps getting better with each update!  Get the edge over your competition.\n\nHow long do you have to snow plow to pay for this app?  Minutes!  Think of it as less than the cost of (2) bags of ice melt or roughly 5% of a new cutting edge on your plow .  Think of it as the cheapest thing you will buy for your snow removal business besides the snacks at the gas station.  \n\nRead everything below to understand why it's worth purchasing....\n\nSnowClient was created by someone that has been in your shoes (snow boots), snow plowing through the night to have the properties clear by morning.\n\nThink about it!  No more clipboards, paper, and handwriting.  Handwriting that is hard to read and takes forever to organize to be able to invoice snow customers after the snow storm is over.  All the while you are hoping that your paperwork notes don't blow away, fall in the snow, or get stolen.  Then how are you supposed to know what hours to bill for and all the other information that was on that piece of paper?  The SnowClient app takes care of all of this.  \n\nWith SnowClient it is easy to document all the work you do and have it immediately organized and accessible in case your snow removal clients want to know when you serviced their property or how deep the snow was when you did service it.  You will have the info at your fingertips and will impress them with your ability to know the facts on the spot.\n\nNo more hours spent calculating your hours for each property to know what to put on the invoice.  It is done the moment you finish servicing the snow account and push stop.\n\nThen when invoicing, all you do is use the sort feature to filter by property and you have all the information you need to invoice for that specific property!\n\nYou can also sort by date and team leader (this could be the driver).\n\nAlso if you put the full address into the property info you or your employees can just click on it to get directions to that property.\n\nSimplify your snow business and minimize the headaches & work after the snow storm.   \n\nSnowClient Helps You Keep Track of:\n\n- Property Names\n\n- Property Details (Address, Deadline Time, Etc.)\n\n- Time Spent Working at Each Property\n\n- Employee Information (if needed)\n\n- Amounts of Salt or De-icing Materials Used at Each Property to be Billed for Later\n\n- Additional Notes - Write Notes and Other Messages That Are Unique to Your Company's Way of Doing Business or Other Information You Would Like but There is no Spot For it.\n\n- Which Employees Serviced Which Properties\n(Employees on the job)\n\nSnowClient Also Will:\n\n- Assist in Accurate Billing\n\n- Keep Work Information Organized\n\n- Create Documentation to Help in Legal Matters\n\n- And So Much More in the Future!\n\n***What this app does NOT do:\n\n- Store Your Information in the Cloud (all the info is stored on your phone)\n\n- Login for Different Users or Privileges\n\n- Sync Information Across Different Users Devices \n\n- Export to Excel or Quickbooks BUT there IS exporting (text, email, etc.)\n\n- Print (unless you export to notes then you can print from notes)\n\nWe know there are probably a lot more features including the ones listed under \"What this app is not\" that you would like to be able to have to help you manage your snow removal properties, snow removal employees, and snow removal customers.  \n\nPLEASE share your ideas with us so we can incorporate them into the app to better serve your needs.  We want to make sure you are satisfied!  We would like to see all 5 Star Reviews so help us out and give us feedback before slamming us with a bad review.  If your life is better because of this app then give us a good review:)  As snow plowers we know what it is like to only hear complaints and on the other side how good it feels when somebody appreciates the work we performed.\n\nSend us a message on our Facebook page by following the Support Link.  We are here for you!"

Systems that contain between 5 and 50 pounds have been the main target of this requirement. Information such as company name, date of recovery, type of refrigerant recovered, quantity of refrigerant recovered, etc., are now required to be logged and reported. This will create a lot of extra work (and paperwork!) for technicians and contractors that are already very busy. \n\nThis is where the R-Log app can save you time and money, as well as help you meet your federal reporting requirements.

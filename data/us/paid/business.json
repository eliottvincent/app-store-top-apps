      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

Profiles can be saved and edited and include state, marital status, pay period, allowances and deductions information.\n\n8 pre-tax or post-tax deductions\n-----------------------------------------\nPayrollguru app allows up to 8 pre-tax and/or post-tax deductions, which are setup as a fixed amount deduction or a % of gross pay. Deductions are customizable and can differ from one profile to another. The deductions can be modified to accommodate various taxing scenarios. For example for 401K deduction - select pretax and turn ON Federal and State switches to exclude it from being taxed on federal and state levels.\n\nOnce you enter all information and include year-to-date gross paid wages, Payroll Guru will calculate your net paycheck amount and will show you the appropraite taxes.\n\nPayroll Guru calculates the following taxes: \n- Federal WIthholding, \n- Social Security, \n- Medicare, \n- State Withholding, \n- State Unemployment (where applicable), \n- State Disability Insurance (where applicable). \n\nCalculated paychecks can be viewed as a pie chart showing the percentage distribution of your gross pay. Paycheck details can be emailed to an employee, employer or a payroll service provider. \n\nPayrollguru app is a must have for any self-employed person or employer in the US to calculate paychecks and verify accuracy of issued paychecks. \n\nPayrollguru app will also be useful to any employee looking to improve financial planning, budget spending and estimate impact of personal changes (i.e. marital status, number of dependents) on net take home amount. \n\nEmployees can also use Payroll Guru app to compare net paycheck amounts (after tax) in different states. This will be useful for employees considering job or relocation to a different state.  \n\nFor small business owners and payroll service providers Payrollguru will help estimate net and gross paycheck amounts in a particular payroll situation, and will provide a pretty accurate assessment of applicable payroll taxes.\n\nPayrollguru app calculates payroll taxes for all 50 states and District of Columbia. \n\nIf you have any improvement suggestions or would like to report a problem please email us directly at support@payrollguru.mobi. \n\nWe also appreciate your positive feedback and reviews.

Lots of things!\n\n•Recommend a good restaurant, including location map and photo\n\n•Email a reminder to yourself, a friend or preset groups\n\n•Document when, why and where you took a great photo\n\n•Update your blog via email\n\n•Track a real estate tour with info about each home (agent or buyer)\n\n•Send a customer the location and details of a house for sale\n\n•Record scientific notes with map location and photo of findings\n\n•Add content to your podcast\n\n•Communicate with elderly relatives who have difficulty typing\n\n•Send product information or newsflashes to clients\n\n•Email great vacation photos, footage, maps and commentary\n\n•Let people know where you are when you need help\n\n•Email your messages in any language (no QWERTY keyboard limits)\n\n•Document where you park your car so you can easily find it again\n\n•And a whole lot more!\n\n\nEmailed voice memos are compatible with Mac, PC and any other computer O/S (uses compressed wave format).\n\nNo file maintenance on your iPhone/iPod Touch, since audio files are not stored there. \n\nNO ADVERTISING in your emails.\nJust a 'Say it Mail it' signature, which you can optionally remove in the 'Info' setup.\n\nSend yourself reminders when you are away from your computer.

Tags can also be applied in bulk to a set of time entries filtered by date range, jobs and/or tags.\n\nFILTERING\nMore powerful filtering that works hand in gloves with your tags. Filter using Jobs, Tags or any combination of both. Sharing uses Filters just like you would expect too.\n\nCLOUD BACKUP & SYNCHRONIZATION\nStart tracking your time on one device and continue on another all with iCloud. Worried about data loss? Easy Hours can automatically backup your data to iCloud and synchronize it with your other devices. \n\nCOLORS\nUse colors to uniquely customize your jobs and your reports.\n\nROUNDING\nDo you prefer round numbers when calculating your total hours? Personalize your timesheet to calculate your total hours exactly as you want it.\n\nCURRENCY\nUse a different currency to bill your clients? We provide support for most currency combinations with the exception of Federation and Galactic Credits.\n\nLANDSCAPE\nUnlike some of our competitors, yes we support landscape! Go on and rotate your device, we dare you!\n\n3D TOUCH\nFor those with compatible devices, 3D Touch has been incorporated to make usage more fun and exciting. Use 3D Touch to jump to your Weekly, Monthly, Custom Dashboards or Charts.\n\nCLOCK IN/OUT NOTIFICATIONS\nConfigurable notifications when you clock in and clock out of a location.  Let Easy Hours free you up from having to constantly track your time in spreadsheets or notes. Notifications will provide you with the confidence that your time is being tracked with precision.\n\nSHARE TIME\nWith the convenience of sharing you can let anyone, including yourself, know exactly how long you have been working on a task. The export has that great look and feel you expect, too. You can even personalize it by choosing a color theme, your Name and Organization, export format (HTML or CSV) and whether to include individual time entries. \n\nPERSONALIZED DAILY REMINDERS\nEasy Hours lets you decide if you’ve spent too much time on a task.  It is smart enough to know when you should call it a day. We provide personalized reminders instead of the usual plain old notifications."

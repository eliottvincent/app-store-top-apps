Now with Scripting and Siri Shortcuts support!\n\nAccounts, recipes, expenses, inventory — life is full of things that we don’t want to forget or misplace. Tap Forms 5 helps you organize all kinds of things in one place — secure, searchable, and accessible on your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch (Mac app sold separately).\n\nHow can one app organize everything? Because not only can you use and customize the more than 30 built-in templates but you can create your own “forms” for inputting any kind of information, even if that information includes pictures, doodles, audio recordings, calculations, file attachments, ratings, or even links to other forms. This makes it almost like building your very own customized organization app.\n\n• Capture your way: Snap a picture, type or scribble some text, record an audio note, scan a barcode — there are 23 different types of information that can be captured with Tap Forms\n\n• Organize your way: Create and design custom forms exactly how you want to for optimal organization. Get started with one of our ready-to-go form templates, or easily make a custom one from scratch with our integrated form building tools.\n\n• Store confidential data with confidence: Tap Forms' security settings let you optionally require a password or a Touch ID scan, and even auto-lock when idle for a custom period of time.

Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

You can save frequently used cost items in your own custom costbook, or you can purchase 3 different Craftsman costbooks within the app that contain detailed costs for over 30,000 common construction items. \n\nJust search for a cost item, enter the quantity, and add it to your estimate in 3 easy steps!\n\nFEATURES\n• Fast and easy user interface for creating cost estimates\n• Customize multiple types of PDF reports, and email them to customers directly from the app\n• Add the logo and contact info for your company to create professional-looking estimates\n• Costs are organized by Phases, Areas, and Categories that can be customized for each project\n• Enter your overhead, profit, and tax rates for each project\n• The app provides full support for international currencies and units\n\nCRAFTSMAN COSTBOOKS\n\nYou can save common cost items in your own custom costbook, and you can purchase 3 different Craftsman Costbooks within the app via in-app purchase for $49.99 each.

It is also the best so far for frequencies below 60 Hz, as it has a very dramatic negative pulse. The Jaws wave is a modified sine wave with an increased initial slope. This wave is the butter wave. Nice and soft and a great starter wave for anyone using the machine for the first time.\n\nVoice commands include; weasel on, weasel off, weasel DC, weasel  AC, weasel shark tooth, weasel hammerhead, weasel jaws, weasel 1, weasel 2, weasel 3, weasel 4, weasel 5 (for presets). It uses some power and works offline. Switch it ON or OFF using mic icon (or \"weasel microphone off\" while ON) Instead of \"weasel\" you can also call your machine using \"hey machine\" or \"ink weasel\" or \"electric shark\" followed by any of the above commands.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nElectric Shark products and services are aimed at professional tattoo artists who are fully aware of all legal requirements including sterilisation techniques and effective disposal of Sharps and Soft Wastes.

This is more than what is available on the FEMA site; it automatically completes the SFHDF form including the Community and map panel information, and provides a map showing the property with the FEMA / NFIP overlay!\n\nFLOOD ZONE quickly and easily gives you the FEMA designated flood zone of your current location or a point you choose on a map. Real estate agents, insurance agents, GIS professionals, surveyors, landowners and anyone with an interest in flood related products or services will find this app's subscription service easy, quick and very affordable. \n\nRealtors and Real estate agents: Add value to the service you provide. Top agents are knowledgeable of flood zones. Areas with a significant risk of flooding can be located miles away from bodies of water or rivers, and lender-required flood insurance can put a reasonably priced home out of the reach of some buyers. Use FLOOD ZONE to identify these properties and save yourself and buyers time and frustration. Listing agents and sellers can benefit too. Purchasers need to know that increases in flood insurance premiums are affected by a property’s flood zone. The FLOOD ZONE app helps listing agents and sellers determine what they need to disclose when placing a home on the market. \n\nHome Owners: FLOOD ZONE can help you monitor if your property’s flood zone has changed because of flood map redrawing. Are you near the boundary of two different zones? Use FLOOD ZONE to see how close you are to higher risk. \n\nFLOOD ZONE shows FEMA approved flood hazard maps using National Flood Insurance Program data that is updated regularly. FLOOD ZONE is an informational tool and not a substitute for an elevation certificate performed by a qualified professional. Data is believed accurate but not guaranteed. This app is NOT an official NFIP or FEMA publication. Please refer to official FEMA and NFIP resources and appropriately qualified professionals for all related determinations.\n\nYou can customize the map to hide or show FIRM Panels, Flood Hazard Zones, LOMRs, LOMAs, River Mile Markers, Coastal Gages, Base Flood Elevations, Water Lines, Coastal Barrier Resources System Area, and Levees.\n\nThe app REQUIRES an auto-renew subscription to the online flood zone maps, offered as an in-app purchase. The app comes with a free trial of access to the flood zone maps before you have to buy anything.\n\nThere is an OPTIONAL auto-renew subscription to create Flood Hazard Determination PDF documents, offered as an in-app purchase. \n\nDiscounts may be provided for longer subscription periods. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user here: https://goo.gl/8gknaa\n\nSubscription auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\nhttp://www.ikonetics.com/app-site-terms-privacy.html"

      "label": "Launch your discreet, skillful campaign for power at work: immediately.\n\n“Foundations” is the first in a series of apps that provide discreet, on-the-job training in the Arts of Power: how to acquire, maintain, and expand your power in the workplace. It is based on the New York Times best-selling book, The 48 Laws of Power, by Robert Greene.\n\n**Thousands of successful users from around the world since June 2011**\n\nThis system does not provide you with sugar-coated, politically correct sayings and exercises. Nor does it offer the ubiquitous “secret-formula” for rapid success still used by charlatans to this day.\n\nReal, lasting power is gained by seeing the world clearly (no matter how ugly some of it may be), and by playing the game of power: subtly, skillfully, and in a way that reflects your own uniqueness.\n\nPlay this social game wisely, and not only will you maximize your power, you will do so in a way that is fun AND profoundly reflects who you are.\n\nRemember: power isn’t the problem, powerlessness is.\n\nCONTENTS\nThe Foundations app utilizes:\n- 25 audio sessions + 5 Bonus sessions (approx. 15 min. each, 9hrs in total)\n- 4 Integrated Tools (always accessible)\n- A member’s web site (for home use)\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nIdeally, listen to one audio session on the way to work, as a morning briefing for your day ahead.\n\nWhile you listen, you are given the opportunity to reflect on how various portions of Greene’s text (plus real-world business examples) relate to your situation. Each session ends with a suggested action designed to help you discreetly and skillfully enhance your power that day at work. \n\nEach session also brings you closer to revealing and strengthening the Foundations of your power: the powerful skills, behaviours and perspectives you already have to some degree. Refine these, and it not only increases your power immediately at work, it also gives you the solid base you need to add power-enhancing capabilities that are new to you.\n\nDuring the day you record any observations or planned actions within the four integrated tools.\n\nThe four tools are: \n1) REFLECTOR: Self Assessment\n2) DOSSIER: Analyzing the people you work with\n3) STRATEGY: Your plans to enhance your power\n4) PERSONA: A vision of the most powerful - and sustainable - aspects of your character that you should present to the world\n\nAs you complete each audio session, a new element is released within one of the tools to help you quickly record your observations and strategies.\n\nBy the time you finish the primary 25 sessions, the observations you have made, and strategies you have designed in the four tools, guide you along your own, unique pathway to mastery. Listen to the sessions again and again, or just keep refining and adding to what you’ve entered within the tools.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO OUR V1.X USERS:\nRobert Greene has been following the development and testing of this unique mastery system over the years. It was directly through the insightful feedback from our first generation users - and the endlessly practical wisdom of Greene’s work - that the 5 new bonus sessions 26-30 came to be. \n\nWARNING! Action-based program\nPursuing mastery requires taking real-world action: however since AMS cannot know your exact situation, this app provides you with suggested actions.  These actions are specific enough to be understood, but must be adapted to fit your unique disposition and situation. Therefore, we cannot know what form your final actions will take or be responsible for any consequences.\n\nRest assured however, Mastering The 48 Laws of Power is all about taking wise, subtle action."

No other app lets you so easily control your iPhone's most valuable data:\n\n1. Update, modify and maintain your contacts easily and conveniently on your computer using Excel, OpenOffice or any other Excel-compatible application.\n2. SA Contacts sends all of your contacts to you from your iPhone in a convenient zip file by email, USB, or through a webpage seen only on your local wifi network! Contact photos are sent, too!\n3. Never again rely on iTunes as your only local source of back up. Nor do you need to share your contacts with Yahoo or other websites in order to have a backup.  SA Contacts' zip file contains ALL of your contacts in a convenient, easy format.\n4. SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16. All column headers and labels in the Excel file are localized.\n17. Export/Import contacts to/from a VCF file.\n18. Backup contacts before import.\n19. Manage groups easily. You can now create, edit, delete groups and add contacts to groups.\n20. Export an Excel file with all photos included - this makes the contacts in your spreadsheet look better.\n21. Import your own file by mapping column headers to contact fields.\n22. Specify your own column headers in export process.\n\nMore detail and up-to-date help guides are available in samapp.com."

      "label": "A must have for Professional Snow Plowers!  Plus it keeps getting better with each update!  Get the edge over your competition.\n\nHow long do you have to snow plow to pay for this app?  Minutes!  Think of it as less than the cost of (2) bags of ice melt or roughly 5% of a new cutting edge on your plow .  Think of it as the cheapest thing you will buy for your snow removal business besides the snacks at the gas station.  \n\nRead everything below to understand why it's worth purchasing....\n\nSnowClient was created by someone that has been in your shoes (snow boots), snow plowing through the night to have the properties clear by morning.\n\nThink about it!  No more clipboards, paper, and handwriting.  Handwriting that is hard to read and takes forever to organize to be able to invoice snow customers after the snow storm is over.  All the while you are hoping that your paperwork notes don't blow away, fall in the snow, or get stolen.  Then how are you supposed to know what hours to bill for and all the other information that was on that piece of paper?  The SnowClient app takes care of all of this.  \n\nWith SnowClient it is easy to document all the work you do and have it immediately organized and accessible in case your snow removal clients want to know when you serviced their property or how deep the snow was when you did service it.  You will have the info at your fingertips and will impress them with your ability to know the facts on the spot.\n\nNo more hours spent calculating your hours for each property to know what to put on the invoice.  It is done the moment you finish servicing the snow account and push stop.\n\nThen when invoicing, all you do is use the sort feature to filter by property and you have all the information you need to invoice for that specific property!\n\nYou can also sort by date and team leader (this could be the driver).\n\nAlso if you put the full address into the property info you or your employees can just click on it to get directions to that property.\n\nSimplify your snow business and minimize the headaches & work after the snow storm.   \n\nSnowClient Helps You Keep Track of:\n\n- Property Names\n\n- Property Details (Address, Deadline Time, Etc.)\n\n- Time Spent Working at Each Property\n\n- Employee Information (if needed)\n\n- Amounts of Salt or De-icing Materials Used at Each Property to be Billed for Later\n\n- Additional Notes - Write Notes and Other Messages That Are Unique to Your Company's Way of Doing Business or Other Information You Would Like but There is no Spot For it.\n\n- Which Employees Serviced Which Properties\n(Employees on the job)\n\nSnowClient Also Will:\n\n- Assist in Accurate Billing\n\n- Keep Work Information Organized\n\n- Create Documentation to Help in Legal Matters\n\n- And So Much More in the Future!\n\n***What this app does NOT do:\n\n- Store Your Information in the Cloud (all the info is stored on your phone)\n\n- Login for Different Users or Privileges\n\n- Sync Information Across Different Users Devices \n\n- Export to Excel or Quickbooks BUT there IS exporting (text, email, etc.)\n\n- Print (unless you export to notes then you can print from notes)\n\nWe know there are probably a lot more features including the ones listed under \"What this app is not\" that you would like to be able to have to help you manage your snow removal properties, snow removal employees, and snow removal customers.  \n\nPLEASE share your ideas with us so we can incorporate them into the app to better serve your needs.  We want to make sure you are satisfied!  We would like to see all 5 Star Reviews so help us out and give us feedback before slamming us with a bad review.  If your life is better because of this app then give us a good review:)  As snow plowers we know what it is like to only hear complaints and on the other side how good it feels when somebody appreciates the work we performed.\n\nSend us a message on our Facebook page by following the Support Link.  We are here for you!"

      "label": "This app may just change the way you do business.\n\nThis is one of the longest running HVAC Manual J8 cooling and heating load calculation apps on the market today. See why tens of thousands of engineers, technicians, and architects have licensed our software for their HVAC engineering needs.\n\n(For full online help, click here: http://bit.ly/1GlRulY.\n\nFor training webinar, click here: http://bit.ly/1IHn7nA)\n\nThis app now includes the HVAC Equipment Locator. Click here for details: http://bit.ly/1yTq539.\n\nThis app allows you to perform detailed block and room-by-room heating and cooling loads for residential buildings out in the field, by taking advantage of the simplicity and power of the iPhone.\n\nThis app was designed by Carmel Software Corporation, a 25-year old software design firm specializing in engineering analysis software applications. We are not just 1 person designing mobile apps out of a bedroom. We are a team of software developers and engineers with over 50 years combined software and engineering design experience. In fact, our software powers the analysis capabilities of major Autodesk (The makers of AutoCAD) software tools such as Autodesk Revit. \n\nThe following is just a small sample of the features included in this app:\n\n1. Calculations based upon abridged ACCA Manual J8 calculations (This is not an ACCA-approved app. For our ACCA-approved iPad app, search for the HVAC ResLoad-J app on the app store)\n\n2. Includes a 1000+ world-wide city weather database\n\n3. Includes data for 100s of construction types for walls, roofs, floors, doors, windows, skylights, ceilings, and more\n\n4. Allows you to create and store an unlimited number of projects\n\n5. Allows you to create an unlimited number of rooms and view individual loads and airflows for those rooms\n\n6. Allows you to specify an unlimited # of opaque types (ie – doors, walls, roofs, floors, ceilings), window types, and skylight types for each building\n\n7. Allows you to instantly view total heating and cooling load results as you update input data\n\n8. Allows you to view comprehensive cooling and heating load breakdown reports including breakdown by opaque load, window load, skylight load, infiltration load, ventilation load and internal load contributions\n\n9. Opaque inputs include opaque type, opaque construction number, dimensions, and opening areas\n\n10. Window inputs include window type, internal and external shading type, overhang dimensions, window area, and more..\n\n11. Additional input types include # of people, # of bedrooms, ventilation airflow, and more..\n\n12. Includes ability to display a wide variety of on-screen reports including checksum reports (ie – BTUh/SqFt, SqFt/Ton, etc.), complete heating and cooling load breakdown reports, and even graphically-pleasing pie charts showing cooling and heating load breakdowns\n\n13. Includes the ability to display a comprehensive HTML report that you can email to yourself or others, and it also includes a spreadsheet attachment that you can open in Excel to further massage data on your desktop\n\n14. Includes English (IP) or Metric (SI) units\n\n15. This is the same technology that powers the Trane MAP iPad app that they offer to their elite dealer network\n\nThe benefits of using this app are numerous including:\n\n1. Great for use out in the field. Quickly size heating and cooling equipment, show the client, then email the results back to your office for further analysis.\n\n2. Show off your advanced on-screen reports to clients convincing them you are using cutting-edge technology\n\n3. Save time by inputting information in the field and then returning to your office to perform more in-depth analysis"

Less time engineering means more one-on-one time with the customer!\n\nHVAC heat loads can be a cumbersome and time consuming and tend to distract from time spent consulting.  SwiftSize addresses this problem by allowing complete heat loads to be performed in mere minutes.  If it takes you more than 10 minutes with SwiftSize you're doing something wrong!\n\nSwiftSize is not a comprehensive room-by-room heat loss/heat gain/CFM calculator.

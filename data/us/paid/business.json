      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

For example for 401K deduction - select pretax and turn ON Federal and State switches to exclude it from being taxed on federal and state levels.\n\nOnce you enter all information and include year-to-date gross paid wages, Payroll Guru will calculate your net paycheck amount and will show you the appropraite taxes.\n\nPayroll Guru calculates the following taxes: \n- Federal WIthholding, \n- Social Security, \n- Medicare, \n- State Withholding, \n- State Unemployment (where applicable), \n- State Disability Insurance (where applicable). \n\nCalculated paychecks can be viewed as a pie chart showing the percentage distribution of your gross pay. Paycheck details can be emailed to an employee, employer or a payroll service provider. \n\nPayrollguru app is a must have for any self-employed person or employer in the US to calculate paychecks and verify accuracy of issued paychecks. \n\nPayrollguru app will also be useful to any employee looking to improve financial planning, budget spending and estimate impact of personal changes (i.e. marital status, number of dependents) on net take home amount. \n\nEmployees can also use Payroll Guru app to compare net paycheck amounts (after tax) in different states. This will be useful for employees considering job or relocation to a different state.  \n\nFor small business owners and payroll service providers Payrollguru will help estimate net and gross paycheck amounts in a particular payroll situation, and will provide a pretty accurate assessment of applicable payroll taxes.\n\nPayrollguru app calculates payroll taxes for all 50 states and District of Columbia. \n\nIf you have any improvement suggestions or would like to report a problem please email us directly at support@payrollguru.mobi. \n\nWe also appreciate your positive feedback and reviews. Thank you for using Payroll Guru app. Enjoy it!"

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "Display your own web site in the embedded browser and configure the barcode scanner to send it the scanned codes.\n\nOr use pic2shop PRO as an external scanner from another app.\n\nOr copy the barcode to the clipboard for use anywhere.\n\nThe embedded web browser supports HTML5, CSS, cookies, javascript, https, etc.  You can easily and inexpensively build a rich barcode scanning app for your own use.  For example, give your employees access to a product information or an asset tracking app on their iPhone, over the internet or your intranet.\n\nEAN and UPC barcodes can be read even on devices without autofocus.\n\n\nTHIS IS NOT A SHOPPING APP.  WE DO NOT PROVIDE THE HOSTING SERVICE NOR THE WEB APPLICATION.  YOUR ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING THE WEB APPLICATION AND HOSTING IT ON YOUR OWN SERVER.\n\n= SUPPORTED BARCODE SYMBOLOGIES =\n\nEAN-13, ISBN\nEAN+2, EAN+5\nEAN-8\nUPC-A\nUPC-E\nGS1 DataBar Omnidirectional (& Stacked)\nGS1 DataBar Expanded (& Stacked)\nGS1 DataBar Limited\nCode 39\nCode 128\nCode 93\nInterleaved 2 of 5 (ITF)\nStandard 2 of 5 (Code 25)\nCodabar (NW-7, USD-4)\nTelepen\nQR\nDataMatrix\n\n= CONFIGURATION =\n\nThere are seven in-app configuration parameters, and one general setting:\n\n1. Home Page URL: the url of the web page displayed when the app launches (optional).\n\n2. Barcode Lookup URL: the url fetched when a barcode is scanned.  The string CODE is replaced by the barcode content, and the string FORMAT is replaced by the symbology of the decoded barcode.  That is how the barcode information is transmitted to your web app, and how the response is displayed to the user.\n\n3. Send GPS coordinates: add a \"&gps=latitude,longitude\" to the lookup URL.\n\n4. Formats: select which formats the scanner needs to look for.  We recommend turning off the formats that are not needed for speed.\n\nPlease note that you can include as many other parameters as you like in either URL, they will be passed as is to your server.  For example, you could give to each user a URL with a different \"&userid=NNN\" parameter to automatically identify them with the web application. \n\nA quick way to configure pic2shop PRO is to send a link to each user (by email or on a web page).  When they click the link after they have installed pic2shop PRO, the three parameters will be set automatically.  The link has the form:\n\np2spro://configure?lookup={lookupURL}&home={homeURL}&formats=EAN13,EAN8,UPCE,ITF,CODE39,CODE128,CODABAR,QR&gps={YES|NO}&settings={YES|NO}\n\nwhere any special character in {lookupURL} and {homeURL} is replaced by its % encoding.  For example, to make pic2shop PRO lookup the UPC database:\n\np2spro://configure?lookup=http%3A//www.upcdatabase.com/item/CODE\n\n5. Auto Orientation: scan Code39, Code128, ITF and Codabar in landscape (as they can be wider than UPCs)\n6. High Resolution: use high resolution scanning (for large barcodes)\n7. Copy to clipboard\n\nIn addition, one can switch off the in-app configuration in the general iOS settings list to help lock down the config.\n\n= PIC2SHOP PRO AS EXTERNAL SCANNER =\n\nPic2shop PRO, can be launched by another app or by a web page to scan a barcode, then pass the result back to the calling app or web page.  A popular use is to import barcodes into the Filemaker Go application.\n\nThe syntax of the custom URL is the following:\n\np2spro://scan?formats=EAN13,EAN8,UPCE,ITF,CODE39,CODE128,CODABAR,QR&callback={callbackURL}\n\nThe callback URL should be percent-encoded and contain the strings CODE and FORMAT, which will be replaced by the barcode content (or 'CANCELLED') and symbology, respectively.\n\n= START SCANNER FROM IN-APP BROWSER =\n\nThe barcode scanner can also be started from the embedded browser with link to a \"p2spro://scan\" URL like described above, which overrides the lookup URL and barcode formats for a single scan. Javascript callbacks are supported.\n\n= NOTES =\n\nFor security reasons, HTTPS will not work with self-signed certificates."

      "label": "Remembering someone's name is one of the simplest, yet most powerful, ways of making a great impression.  Our app enables you to record, retain, and retrieve names and people whenever and wherever you are. \n\nIt makes a person feel good to hear their own name, and they pay more attention.  Research shows that hearing our name activates our brain, even when in a noisy room.  Influential leaders will make it a point to use people's names, and even to mention personal details that they share in common. They do this intentionally because they know it matters.  We feel better when people remember us, and worse when they don't.  When you forget someone's name, they feel that they (and their business!) are not important to you.\n\nIt is no exaggeration that business deals often fail because someone failed to remember the right name at the right time.  In the age of email and online relationships, being able to use someone's name in a face-to-face meeting can set you apart. We intuitively know this, and yet without conscious effort, name recall is an elusive skill.  To make matters worse, this skill worsens after middle-age unless we train ourselves to remember.\n\nWho's Who has an option for spaced repetition.  This is a cognitive phenomenon where people recall information better when studied a few times over a long period of time than when studied many times over a short period.  If crammed memories are not refreshed, they are likely to decay to nothing.  If you enable reminders on the name that you enter, you will be sent a simple notification with the new name at increasingly long intervals.  You can turn reminders off easily at any time.\n\nPersonal details such as hobbies or children's names can assist in memory recall.  Our memories are more like stories than items in a spreadsheet, and associating interesting tidbits with the name will actually help in recalling it. It is also useful to record when and where you met, not only because that data could be useful, but also it helps fill in the story that aids in memory recall. Our app has several optional fields for entering extraneous details for those very important contacts.  All of these fields can be searched in case you are trying to remember the name of the lady from \"Hawaii\" or the man who was an avid \"baseball\" fan.\n\nMemory experts often use mnemonics, word play, and outright whimsical visualizations. Think \"Joe from Jersey,\" \"Suzy sales,\" or \"Richard the rich guy.\"   You might picture Roseanne holding a bouquet of roses, or Nancy wearing fancy pants.  Shirley drinking a Shirley Temple. If you are so inclined, our app has a \"hint\" field to capture your creative associations. The hint is revealed on demand in the Quiz, so that you can practice active recall testing.  Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study.\n\nMost importantly, you must decide to make remembering names a priority.  The primary reason we have a problem remembering names is that we're not focused on learning it.  We have a lot of information competing for our attention, much of it more immediately important than a name.  Once you make the decision consciously to remember names because you care about the people you are interacting with, you immediately become much better at it.  Remember, people feel good when you remember their name, and worse when you don't."

Press power button, you can see signal strength bar moving, then slide the thumb to set the threshold (0.00~1.00), the value will be saved for next time use. \n\n2.If the indicator start flashing, that means a real recording start. check the recorded files,some test files can be found  there . \n\n3.In each scenario, the threshold value could be different, set it according to the situation. For example,for snoring and dream talk recording at night, set the value to 0.05, but at daytime, you probably have to set it at 0.10. \n\n4. Attention for naming a label: all files can be saved to your computer. Label,as a part of a file name, has to follow some rules for different computer OS.For this app, make it simple as follows,the name length is better to be limited to within 125 characters,as for the kind of characters, for Windows,you can't use ?\\|/ etc. in your label, otherwise iTunes will report a error such as no files found, just rename it as windows' requirement to fix it.\n\n\n**About Volume**\nSpeaker mode or earphone mode,  the speaker hardware is shared by all apps in your device, please check both modes and adjust the volume if you can't hear anything.\n\n**How to download recording files**\nFor file downloading,  iTunes File sharing Feature is recommended.  The basic steps : connect to iTunes->click \"iPhone\" ->click \"App\"->scroll down to find \"File sharing\"->click this app's icon -> select recording fils on the right box ->click \" Save\".

We will put your call on hold and dial our recording line. As soon as our line answers tap the merge button on your screen to create a 3 way call between your other caller and our recording line. \n\nIf you want to record an outgoing call, just press the record button. The app will dial our recording line and will begin recording as soon as our line answers. Once that happens, tap the add call button on your screen, call the person you want to record, then press the merge button when they answer. \n\n—————————————————————— \n\nCan I download recordings to my computer? \n\nYes, and we've made it extremely easy to do this. Simply select a recording then tap the arrow button to the right of the player. This will show a screen containing a number of ways to share your recording. The most popular ways to transfer recordings to your computer are by email, Dropbox or Google Drive.\n\n—————————————————————— \n\nHow many recordings can I make? \n\nAs many as you want! We don't have a limit on the number of recordings you can make. \n\n—————————————————————— \n\nIf you upgrade to 1 year unlimited recording, payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

Systems that contain between 5 and 50 pounds have been the main target of this requirement. Information such as company name, date of recovery, type of refrigerant recovered, quantity of refrigerant recovered, etc., are now required to be logged and reported. This will create a lot of extra work (and paperwork!) for technicians and contractors that are already very busy. \n\nThis is where the R-Log app can save you time and money, as well as help you meet your federal reporting requirements.

Social Security professionals never need to worry about having a hearing or client meeting without this invaluable resource, including all of its companion publications. \n\nWhat users are saying:\n\n\"Excellent app – works like a charm and worth every penny.  I have Job Browser on all my computers, but now I have the DOT/SCO information in my pocket (on my iPhone).  This means I can use it in meetings and many other places where I don’t have my computer.\"  ~ David Camp (SSDB Attorney)\n\nJob Sleuth \"is a great asset for Social Security Attorneys and Vocational Experts to use while interviewing clients in their office or at the hearing [...] It is a MUST have for a Social Security Disability Practitioner.\" ~ Ed P. (Vocational Consultant)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n-  All 12,741 job codes in the DOT are present and accounted for, along with detailed explanations of each of their elements;\n\n-  Every job includes the information from the DOT, SCO, MPSMS, Work Fields, Aptitudes, and Temperaments and is presented in an easily accessible manner (over 65 fields in each code);\n\n-  Airprint compatibility allows you to print any job's complete information or the results from your searches.  \n\n-  Email all of the job's information or searches to yourself or anyone else for later review or reference.\n\n-  A completely local database means you don't ever have to worry about losing signal or not having access to wi-fi.\n\nBENEFITS:\n\n-  Never worry about lugging around two huge volumes to hearings and meetings.\n\n-  Title Search, Code Search, Multi-Code Search, Advanced Search, Transferability Search, and GOE browser make finding the right job(s) a breeze, much faster than could have been possible with the physical volumes.\n\n-  Less than 1/4 the price of the physical volumes, and 1/8 the price of many PC applications with similar features.\n\n*tab bar icons created by icons8"

      "label": "Version 2.0 Available Now!!\nNow more handsomer, faster, and even more feature packed than ever (New Invoice Section*!).\n\nTimecard Pro is a multi-use app to keep track of your hours worked and your work schedule. It's great for freelance workers, employers to track their employees, or for anyone who wants to see a live view of how much money they're earning. The possibilities of utilizing the app are endless.\n\nSimply add your Job(s) or employees, and then clock in and out whenever needed. At the end of your pay period, you can export your timecards and email a report to your boss or client. Need to clock into multiple jobs, and have a different hourly rate for each? Not a problem, Timecard Pro can handle all of this, without breaking a sweat.\n\n----------------------------------------- \n\nWhat our users are saying: \n\n\"I love it...Life is easy now\" \n\n\"Top Notch, Solid, & Reliable...Click & Forget\" \n\n\"Design and Navigation Success!\" \n\n----------------------------------------- \n\n\nUniversal application: Purchase once, use on both your iPhone and iPad.\n\nFeatures: \n- Easy to use, intuitive interface. Simple, single touch \"Clock in/Clock Out\" dial for on-the-go time tracking.\n- Calendar section allows you to add your work shifts, with pop-up push reminders for when you work, as well as the ability to manually add timecards, and view all of the days you worked or have work scheduled. \n- Users:  Add unlimited users within the app, all with their own separate data. Protect each user data with a password lock.\n- Reports page lets you export multiple Pay Periods, regardless of job, all in the same email with Text, CSV, and PDF export options.\n- 2 Data Backup options, including Email Export, and a built-in 'Restore Data' section.\n- Main display shows money earned, clocked-in time, and how many hours you've worked.\n- Use the menu button on the homepage, to quickly select the job/employee you need to clock into.\n- Clock into multiple jobs/employees at the same time.\n- Icon badge indicator shows how many jobs you're currently clocked into without having to open the app.\n- Set up a different hourly rate for each job.\n- Calculate both daily and weekly overtime hours at the same time.\n- Remain clocked in, even if you turn your phone off! No need to keep the app open. \n- Manually add individual days that you’ve missed.\n- Manually edit timecards to change clocked in/out times, add notes, etc... \n- Add notes for each job or day, and include them in your exported timecard (setting turned on by default). \n- Change Currency Symbol for your specific region.\n- Passcode lock: require a passcode to access app.\n- Automatic 24hr mode detected.\n- Manually sync data between multiple devices, using the backup options. \n- 2 themes (Dark or Light). \n- Updated and optimized for iOS 9. \nAnd many MANY more features to come! \n\niPad version:\n- Completely designed for the iPad, in landscape mode.  With a split screen multi-task feature, you can constantly see the home page on the left to clock in/out of jobs as needed, while you navigate the rest of the app on the right side of the screen.\n\n*In-App Purchase:\n- Invoices:  Create invoices from pay periods, and manually add items (expenses, mileage, etc...).  A beautifully designed invoice will be created, in which a PDF version can be emailed, printed, saved to your Dropbox, or shared.\n\n\nNote to Employers: \nEmployers can add Employees under the \"Jobs\" page instead of entering job names. You can then use the menu from the Home Page to select your employee once they arrive at work, just like a 'job'. Each employee can be set up with a different hourly rate, having their own timecards, etc... \n\nWe love to hear your suggestions!! \nWithout your ideas, we can't shape this app into what YOU need. \nPlease email us at: support@eveleighstudios.com \n\n**Before leaving negative feedback, please contact us to see if we can help you with your concerns. Emails are typically responded within 24 hours."

      "label": "\"This productivity app is designed to allow copyright owners the ability to enforce their rights by the quick and easy creation of a legal Notification of Infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA Notice”). QuickDMCA permits copyright owners, or their agents, to expeditiously send DMCA Notices to ISP’s, hosts, billing processors, or other companies providing services to publishers of infringing content.  Under federal law, after receiving a DMCA Notice, the service provider is obligated to disable access to the content or cease providing services to the infringing material.  Repeat infringers must have their accounts permanently terminated.  QuickDMCA allows users to protect their valuable content from online piracy, at the touch of a button.  The application will allow the user to generate a DMCA Notice that contains all the necessary legal statements and information required by federal law, in minutes.  Copyright lawsuits can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to pursue, with no guaranty of result.  DMCA Notices can cause infringing content to be quickly removed from the Internet – often in a matter of days…or even hours!  Online service providers like hosts, third party billing processors, name servers, and payment gateways, must respond to DMCA Notices promptly, or risk becoming vicariously liable for infringement caused by their customers or subscribers.  QuickDMCA solves a common cyber-theft problem encountered by publishers of creative content such as pictures, videos, music, software, or graphics. Policing the unauthorized reproduction of your expressive works has never been easier, with QuickDMCA.  \n\nQuick DMCA™ allows you to:\n- Create a DMCA Notice containing all the required elements mandated by the DMCA, including:\n    Your contact information, email address, and website; \n    The name of the online service provider associated with the infringing content;\n    The location of the infringing content;\n    Sworn statements as to good faith belief of infringement; and,\n    The necessary electronic signature\n- Find the proper Designated Agent associated with specific online service providers\n- Execute the DMCA Notice on your touch screen, to capture your e-signature\n- Send the DMCA Notice directly from your mobile device to the company providing services to the infringer, in both plain text and       .pdf formats\n - Receive a copy of the transmitted DMCA Notice for your records\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., Internet attorney and inventor of the patented BirthDateVerifer™, the Quick2257® mobile app, and other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting DMCA Notices for the purpose of enforcing copyrights and taking down infringing material.  Anyone involved in the creation or publication of digital media can now quickly generate and send the necessary Notification of Infringement under federal law, using this simple mobile app.\n\nFor more information on DMCA copyright enforcement or other legal issues, please contact: http://www.firstamendment.com\n \n Note: Nothing contained on this site is intended as legal advice. Please consult with a competent copyright attorney for advice on proper use of this application and enforcement of intellectual property rights."

Available on iPhone and iPad. \nDatamatrix is a matrix two-dimensional barcode which may be printed as a square or rectangular symbol made up of individual squares. Data matrix is a graphical representation of data in a machine readable form, used to enable automatic reading of the Element Strings. \nDatamatrix barcode is composed of two separate parts : the finder pattern, which is used by the scanner to locate the symbol, and the encoded data itself. \nThe finder pattern defines the shape (square or rectangle), the size, X-dimension and the number of rows and columns in the symbol. It has a function similar to the Auxiliary Patterns (Start, Stop and Centre patterns) in an EAN/UPC barcode and allows the scanner to identify the symbol as a Data matrix barcode.\nThe solid dark is called the “L finder pattern”. It is primarily used to determine the size, orientation and distortion of the data matrix barcode.\nThe other two sides of the finder pattern are alternating light and dark elements, known as the “Clock Track”. This defines the basic structure of the datamatrix and can also help determine its size and distortion.\nThe data is then encoded in a matrix within the Finder pattern. This is a translation into the binary Datamatrix symbology characters (numeric or alphanumeric)."

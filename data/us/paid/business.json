Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

      "label": "Launch your discreet, skillful campaign for power at work: immediately.\n\n“Foundations” is the first in a series of apps that provide discreet, on-the-job training in the Arts of Power: how to acquire, maintain, and expand your power in the workplace. It is based on the New York Times best-selling book, The 48 Laws of Power, by Robert Greene.\n\n**Thousands of successful users from around the world since June 2011**\n\nThis system does not provide you with sugar-coated, politically correct sayings and exercises. Nor does it offer the ubiquitous “secret-formula” for rapid success still used by charlatans to this day.\n\nReal, lasting power is gained by seeing the world clearly (no matter how ugly some of it may be), and by playing the game of power: subtly, skillfully, and in a way that reflects your own uniqueness.\n\nPlay this social game wisely, and not only will you maximize your power, you will do so in a way that is fun AND profoundly reflects who you are.\n\nRemember: power isn’t the problem, powerlessness is.\n\nCONTENTS\nThe Foundations app utilizes:\n- 25 audio sessions + 5 Bonus sessions (approx. 15 min. each, 9hrs in total)\n- 4 Integrated Tools (always accessible)\n- A member’s web site (for home use)\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nIdeally, listen to one audio session on the way to work, as a morning briefing for your day ahead.\n\nWhile you listen, you are given the opportunity to reflect on how various portions of Greene’s text (plus real-world business examples) relate to your situation. Each session ends with a suggested action designed to help you discreetly and skillfully enhance your power that day at work. \n\nEach session also brings you closer to revealing and strengthening the Foundations of your power: the powerful skills, behaviours and perspectives you already have to some degree. Refine these, and it not only increases your power immediately at work, it also gives you the solid base you need to add power-enhancing capabilities that are new to you.\n\nDuring the day you record any observations or planned actions within the four integrated tools.\n\nThe four tools are: \n1) REFLECTOR: Self Assessment\n2) DOSSIER: Analyzing the people you work with\n3) STRATEGY: Your plans to enhance your power\n4) PERSONA: A vision of the most powerful - and sustainable - aspects of your character that you should present to the world\n\nAs you complete each audio session, a new element is released within one of the tools to help you quickly record your observations and strategies.\n\nBy the time you finish the primary 25 sessions, the observations you have made, and strategies you have designed in the four tools, guide you along your own, unique pathway to mastery. Listen to the sessions again and again, or just keep refining and adding to what you’ve entered within the tools.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO OUR V1.X USERS:\nRobert Greene has been following the development and testing of this unique mastery system over the years. It was directly through the insightful feedback from our first generation users - and the endlessly practical wisdom of Greene’s work - that the 5 new bonus sessions 26-30 came to be. \n\nWARNING! Action-based program\nPursuing mastery requires taking real-world action: however since AMS cannot know your exact situation, this app provides you with suggested actions.  These actions are specific enough to be understood, but must be adapted to fit your unique disposition and situation. Therefore, we cannot know what form your final actions will take or be responsible for any consequences.\n\nRest assured however, Mastering The 48 Laws of Power is all about taking wise, subtle action."

You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

O rei James I da Inglaterra reuniu os maiores estudiosos religiosos e linguistas para uma nova tradução da Bíblia, a fim de estabelecer a tradução mais precisa e mais digna até à data. Ele nomeou 54 estudiosos para trabalhar na tradução, e 47 trabalharam em seis grupos em três locais por sete anos.\r\n\r\nApós a conclusão, a Bíblia King James foi impressa pela primeira vez em 1611 por Robert Barker. A Bíblia era muito grande, cerca de 40cm de altura. Por causa do alto custo e valor, foi anunciado para as igrejas que a Bíblia devia ser acorrentada nos púlpitos.\r\n\r\nA Bíblia 1611 foi autorizada para ser lida nas igrejas, razão pela qual foi chamada de Versão Autorizada. Enfim, nós da BV Books estamos felizes em poder apresentar, a Versão Autorizada em português da Bíblia King James."

The date and start odometer are entered automatically.\n \nThere are no pretty graphs, fancy reports or a multitude of settings, just simple, quick entries.\n \nAll entries can be exported to a CSV file for manipulation (graphs and wiz-bang formulas) in a spreadsheet.\n\nFeatures details:\n- Add entries for each trip including distance, places, reasons and general notes.\n- 1 to 3 taps for a new entry\n- Include start and end times, if required\n- Export to CSV\n- PDF by month, last month, last 3 months, last year, or all\n- Email CSV and PDF\n- Popup monthly summaries"

      "label": "I started off selling small handmade items on various sites.  Initially, I struggled with pricing.  How do you balance costs, while at the same time making a decent profit.  To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

When used, the link will open the native phone app to save the contact.\n\nApart from contacts, you can also write links & texts. Even multiple entries on one card.\n\nThe app has a history section that will show you all the entries used by you in the past. From here you can reuse the entries to make your life easier if you need to write multiple cards. Also from here, you can permanently remove any data that we have about you."

Users can also select whether they want to calculate using SI Metric units or Imperial units.\n\nPrecision for VCF, GSV, MTons, LTons and Bbls can be changed using the settings screen. Settings are saved in the app so that when you use the app next time it will calculate with your chosen settings.\n\nDensities can be entered in the following formats which are automatically recognized:\ne.g 0.9664 / 966.4 / 9664\n\nThe app can calculate for crude oil, black and white products, lubrication oils and special applications, and input can be changed between density in vacuum at 15 and 20 deg C/ API / relative density / observed, and degrees Celsius / Fahrenheit by touching the applicable buttons.\n\nThe user has the choice to calculate using as input observed M3 / M3 at 15 / observed Barrels / Barrels 60 / Metric tons air/vac / Ltons / Gallons.\n\nThe user can also calculate weights of LPG / NGL, using either density @ 15C, relative density @60F, observed density or density @ 20C.\n\nAside from the conversion screen with conversions between API, observed density, density 15, density 20 and relative density, there is also a screen with conversions used in LPG / NGL.\n\nFor products, lube oils and crude there are two tools for calculating final density when blending two components: one tool that calculates the blend after loading the 2nd component, and another tool that lets the user choose the two components and advises which component to load first, based on density 15C or API 60F and actual temperature of the components. Both tools also calculate volume shrinkage due to blending.\n\nA utility has been included that enables the user to export data from the calculator screen directly into a database for future reference. The same utility can be used to enter data manually and edit previously entered data.\n\nFor a detailed tutorial please visit our webpage (http://mooringmarineconsultancy.wordpress.com)."

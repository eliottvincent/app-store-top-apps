      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

No typing required. Your email address and subject are autofilled.\n\nIf you are using an iPhone, your message is sent off immediately, thanks to cell towers. iPod Touch devices store the email and send as soon as they are able to make a Wi-Fi connection.\n\nGreat way to send anyone a detailed email without using the keyboard.\n\nSend an MMS Instant Message\n\nSo many uses, we can't imagine them all. You will think of many more\n\nNOTES: iPod Touch requires headphones with microphone and a Wi-Fi connection.\nThe iPhone has a microphone built-in.\nCamera may only be available on iPhone.\nNot all devices can take movies."

      "label": "Warm up your cold calls with SwiftCall. Swiftly auto dial through intelligently sorted call lists, review detailed analytics of call sessions, and swiftly take follow-up actions without ever leaving the app. Make phone calls without having to dial a number into a keypad. SwiftCall is the way call time was meant to be.\n\nCollaboration is key, and SwiftCall makes it easy to make sales calls as a team with lead sharing and analytics reporting. Stop maintaining that disorganized spreadsheet or scanning your eyes between a notepad and a phone. If you've been calling over 25, 50, or even 100 leads per day, get ready for SwiftCall to completely transform your sales process.\n\nCall Lists:\nManage the lead pipeline intelligently from first contact through close. Create leads or import a CSV with thousands of them and then SwiftCall will do the work of sorting them into call lists. SwiftCall tracks progress with each lead as you call to determine which ones are more promising. \n\nNo need to restart data entry for leads: import a CSV with hundreds or even thousands of leads within seconds. Share leads easily between SwiftCallers to work together as a team.\n\nAnalytics & Achievements:\nIf you can't measure, you can't manage. That's why SwiftCall keeps track of progress from the analytics Dashboard. View charts with calls, deals, and revenue per day. It’s like a fitness tracker for business growth. Review call logs and achievements earned to measure long-term performance. Create reports from the Dashboard to show off your performance to the team.\n\nFollow-Up Actions:\nCall time doesn’t just stop with the call. You want to stay fresh in the mind of your lead so they know that their time is valued. That’s why SwiftCall can quickly send follow-up emails or text messages as a follow-up. The Planner then helps schedule the next call and creates notifications for when the time comes to call again. If you have it enabled, Siri Suggestions will also prompt you right before your scheduled call, allowing you to tap the notification to dial in.\n\nMaybe you are hustling to build your business, or perhaps you work on a sales team with big dreams.

Systems that contain between 5 and 50 pounds have been the main target of this requirement. Information such as company name, date of recovery, type of refrigerant recovered, quantity of refrigerant recovered, etc., are now required to be logged and reported. This will create a lot of extra work (and paperwork!) for technicians and contractors that are already very busy. \n\nThis is where the R-Log app can save you time and money, as well as help you meet your federal reporting requirements.

See why tens of thousands of engineers, technicians, and architects have licensed our software for their HVAC engineering needs.\n\n(For full online help, click here: http://bit.ly/1GlRulY.\n\nFor training webinar, click here: http://bit.ly/1IHn7nA)\n\nThis app now includes the HVAC Equipment Locator. Click here for details: http://bit.ly/1yTq539.\n\nThis app allows you to perform detailed block and room-by-room heating and cooling loads for residential buildings out in the field, by taking advantage of the simplicity and power of the iPhone.\n\nThis app was designed by Carmel Software Corporation, a 25-year old software design firm specializing in engineering analysis software applications. We are not just 1 person designing mobile apps out of a bedroom. We are a team of software developers and engineers with over 50 years combined software and engineering design experience. In fact, our software powers the analysis capabilities of major Autodesk (The makers of AutoCAD) software tools such as Autodesk Revit. \n\nThe following is just a small sample of the features included in this app:\n\n1. Calculations based upon abridged ACCA Manual J8 calculations (This is not an ACCA-approved app. For our ACCA-approved iPad app, search for the HVAC ResLoad-J app on the app store)\n\n2. Includes a 1000+ world-wide city weather database\n\n3. Includes data for 100s of construction types for walls, roofs, floors, doors, windows, skylights, ceilings, and more\n\n4. Allows you to create and store an unlimited number of projects\n\n5. Allows you to create an unlimited number of rooms and view individual loads and airflows for those rooms\n\n6. Allows you to specify an unlimited # of opaque types (ie – doors, walls, roofs, floors, ceilings), window types, and skylight types for each building\n\n7. Allows you to instantly view total heating and cooling load results as you update input data\n\n8. Allows you to view comprehensive cooling and heating load breakdown reports including breakdown by opaque load, window load, skylight load, infiltration load, ventilation load and internal load contributions\n\n9. Opaque inputs include opaque type, opaque construction number, dimensions, and opening areas\n\n10. Window inputs include window type, internal and external shading type, overhang dimensions, window area, and more..\n\n11. Additional input types include # of people, # of bedrooms, ventilation airflow, and more..\n\n12. Includes ability to display a wide variety of on-screen reports including checksum reports (ie – BTUh/SqFt, SqFt/Ton, etc.), complete heating and cooling load breakdown reports, and even graphically-pleasing pie charts showing cooling and heating load breakdowns\n\n13. Includes the ability to display a comprehensive HTML report that you can email to yourself or others, and it also includes a spreadsheet attachment that you can open in Excel to further massage data on your desktop\n\n14. Includes English (IP) or Metric (SI) units\n\n15. This is the same technology that powers the Trane MAP iPad app that they offer to their elite dealer network\n\nThe benefits of using this app are numerous including:\n\n1. Great for use out in the field. Quickly size heating and cooling equipment, show the client, then email the results back to your office for further analysis.\n\n2. Show off your advanced on-screen reports to clients convincing them you are using cutting-edge technology\n\n3. Save time by inputting information in the field and then returning to your office to perform more in-depth analysis"

You can search documents by name easily in the app.\n\nBy turning on the auto file sync with iCloud Drive, you can easily access your scanned documents from any other device.\nBy turning on WiFi file sharing, you can read all PDF files on the device.\n\nYou can also email documents out as PDF or JPEG files.\nExport OCR result as txt or docx file.\n\nOther ways to import / export documents: \n- Fax documents to over 100 countries instantly (cost calculated by the number of pages and recipient country and paid via in-app purchase).\n- Transfer all your documents from one device to another.\n- Support import / upload to SMB (Win / Mac / NAS).\n- Support import / upload to iCloud Drive.\n- Support import / upload to Dropbox.\n- Support import / upload to Google Drive.\n- Support import / upload to Box.\n- Support import / upload to SkyDrive.\n- Support import / upload to WebDAV Server.\n- Print documents via AirPrint.  \n- Save documents to Photo Albums. \n- \"Open In\" other apps, e.g. iBooks, Kindle, Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nImport Files: \n- Import PDFs via \"Open In\" from other apps.\n- Import PDF/JPEG from cloud storages.\n\nFax:\n- In-app fax sending and receiving is convenient especially when you are out of office or have no fax machine at all. \n- Receive a push notification when a fax is sent or received succesffuly or failed for what reason.\n- Receive faxes with non auto renewable subscription which supports dozens of countries (we kept adding more) for users to subscribe a fax number for receiving faxes.\n- Deny all faxes when no need to receive any fax.\n\nTip: For best edge detection, please place your documents in high contrast to the background, e.g. put your white paper on a dark table. \n\nYour feedbacks are very important to us. \nPlease contact our customer service at support@ifunplay.com for resolving problems before submitting feedback in appstore. Most problems can be solved easily, but we cannot help you solve problems from the comments."

The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "The Liberty Item Entry App is designed to allow users of Resaleworld's popular Liberty software to enter and update inventory while on the go. Accounts can be added and updated as well. This app allows store employees to move to wherever they need to be with the convenience of a mobile device, while still having the ability access and enter information.This app helps improve productivity and helps to overcome a number of logistical challenges. The Item Entry App is ideal for the following scenarios: adding photographs to large amounts of new or existing inventory; adding large furniture which is difficult to relocate to a PC with a full installation of Liberty software; traveling to estate sales to add inventory; adding and updating inventory stored in a warehouse.\n\nThe item entry interface includes several design features that are optimized for a touch-screen, smaller display for popular mobile devices. A list of the 20 most commonly used categories speeds up item entry considerably. A graphical trend analysis tool calculates and displays pricing information based on the category and brand of the item being entered, based on the past year's sales data. Adding photographs to items is simple and quick both when using images from the device's photo library or when taking new pictures with the device's camera.  This app also allows users to print tags for inventory, to email item lists directly to accountholders, and to view an account's transaction history.\n\nThis app requires an installation Liberty Software (Liberty REACT, Liberty 5, Liberty 4 Consignment, or Liberty 4 Trading Assistants) and either a qualifying Web Service plan or a stand-alone Liberty Mobile Access license. Please contact Resaleworld with any questions about Liberty Mobile Access eligibility."

No other app lets you so easily control your iPhone's most valuable data:\n\n1. Update, modify and maintain your contacts easily and conveniently on your computer using Excel, OpenOffice or any other Excel-compatible application.\n2. SA Contacts sends all of your contacts to you from your iPhone in a convenient zip file by email, USB, or through a webpage seen only on your local wifi network! Contact photos are sent, too!\n3. Never again rely on iTunes as your only local source of back up. Nor do you need to share your contacts with Yahoo or other websites in order to have a backup.  SA Contacts' zip file contains ALL of your contacts in a convenient, easy format.\n4. SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16. All column headers and labels in the Excel file are localized.\n17. Export/Import contacts to/from a VCF file.\n18. Backup contacts before import.\n19. Manage groups easily. You can now create, edit, delete groups and add contacts to groups.\n20. Export an Excel file with all photos included - this makes the contacts in your spreadsheet look better.\n21. Import your own file by mapping column headers to contact fields.\n22. Specify your own column headers in export process.\n\nMore detail and up-to-date help guides are available in samapp.com."

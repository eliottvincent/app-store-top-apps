Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "A must have for Professional Snow Plowers!  Plus it keeps getting better with each update!  Get the edge over your competition.\n\nHow long do you have to snow plow to pay for this app?  Minutes!  Think of it as less than the cost of (2) bags of ice melt or roughly 5% of a new cutting edge on your plow .  Think of it as the cheapest thing you will buy for your snow removal business besides the snacks at the gas station.  \n\nRead everything below to understand why it's worth purchasing....\n\nSnowClient was created by someone that has been in your shoes (snow boots), snow plowing through the night to have the properties clear by morning.\n\nThink about it!  No more clipboards, paper, and handwriting.  Handwriting that is hard to read and takes forever to organize to be able to invoice snow customers after the snow storm is over.  All the while you are hoping that your paperwork notes don't blow away, fall in the snow, or get stolen.  Then how are you supposed to know what hours to bill for and all the other information that was on that piece of paper?  The SnowClient app takes care of all of this.  \n\nWith SnowClient it is easy to document all the work you do and have it immediately organized and accessible in case your snow removal clients want to know when you serviced their property or how deep the snow was when you did service it.  You will have the info at your fingertips and will impress them with your ability to know the facts on the spot.\n\nNo more hours spent calculating your hours for each property to know what to put on the invoice.  It is done the moment you finish servicing the snow account and push stop.\n\nThen when invoicing, all you do is use the sort feature to filter by property and you have all the information you need to invoice for that specific property!\n\nYou can also sort by date and team leader (this could be the driver).\n\nAlso if you put the full address into the property info you or your employees can just click on it to get directions to that property.\n\nSimplify your snow business and minimize the headaches & work after the snow storm.   \n\nSnowClient Helps You Keep Track of:\n\n- Property Names\n\n- Property Details (Address, Deadline Time, Etc.)\n\n- Time Spent Working at Each Property\n\n- Employee Information (if needed)\n\n- Amounts of Salt or De-icing Materials Used at Each Property to be Billed for Later\n\n- Additional Notes - Write Notes and Other Messages That Are Unique to Your Company's Way of Doing Business or Other Information You Would Like but There is no Spot For it.\n\n- Which Employees Serviced Which Properties\n(Employees on the job)\n\nSnowClient Also Will:\n\n- Assist in Accurate Billing\n\n- Keep Work Information Organized\n\n- Create Documentation to Help in Legal Matters\n\n- And So Much More in the Future!\n\n***What this app does NOT do:\n\n- Store Your Information in the Cloud (all the info is stored on your phone)\n\n- Login for Different Users or Privileges\n\n- Sync Information Across Different Users Devices \n\n- Export to Excel or Quickbooks BUT there IS exporting (text, email, etc.)\n\n- Print (unless you export to notes then you can print from notes)\n\nWe know there are probably a lot more features including the ones listed under \"What this app is not\" that you would like to be able to have to help you manage your snow removal properties, snow removal employees, and snow removal customers.  \n\nPLEASE share your ideas with us so we can incorporate them into the app to better serve your needs.  We want to make sure you are satisfied!  We would like to see all 5 Star Reviews so help us out and give us feedback before slamming us with a bad review.  If your life is better because of this app then give us a good review:)  As snow plowers we know what it is like to only hear complaints and on the other side how good it feels when somebody appreciates the work we performed.\n\nSend us a message on our Facebook page by following the Support Link.  We are here for you!"

      "label": "\"This productivity app is designed to allow copyright owners the ability to enforce their rights by the quick and easy creation of a legal Notification of Infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA Notice”). QuickDMCA permits copyright owners, or their agents, to expeditiously send DMCA Notices to ISP’s, hosts, billing processors, or other companies providing services to publishers of infringing content.  Under federal law, after receiving a DMCA Notice, the service provider is obligated to disable access to the content or cease providing services to the infringing material.  Repeat infringers must have their accounts permanently terminated.  QuickDMCA allows users to protect their valuable content from online piracy, at the touch of a button.  The application will allow the user to generate a DMCA Notice that contains all the necessary legal statements and information required by federal law, in minutes.  Copyright lawsuits can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to pursue, with no guaranty of result.  DMCA Notices can cause infringing content to be quickly removed from the Internet – often in a matter of days…or even hours!  Online service providers like hosts, third party billing processors, name servers, and payment gateways, must respond to DMCA Notices promptly, or risk becoming vicariously liable for infringement caused by their customers or subscribers.  QuickDMCA solves a common cyber-theft problem encountered by publishers of creative content such as pictures, videos, music, software, or graphics. Policing the unauthorized reproduction of your expressive works has never been easier, with QuickDMCA.  \n\nQuick DMCA™ allows you to:\n- Create a DMCA Notice containing all the required elements mandated by the DMCA, including:\n    Your contact information, email address, and website; \n    The name of the online service provider associated with the infringing content;\n    The location of the infringing content;\n    Sworn statements as to good faith belief of infringement; and,\n    The necessary electronic signature\n- Find the proper Designated Agent associated with specific online service providers\n- Execute the DMCA Notice on your touch screen, to capture your e-signature\n- Send the DMCA Notice directly from your mobile device to the company providing services to the infringer, in both plain text and       .pdf formats\n - Receive a copy of the transmitted DMCA Notice for your records\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., Internet attorney and inventor of the patented BirthDateVerifer™, the Quick2257® mobile app, and other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting DMCA Notices for the purpose of enforcing copyrights and taking down infringing material.  Anyone involved in the creation or publication of digital media can now quickly generate and send the necessary Notification of Infringement under federal law, using this simple mobile app.\n\nFor more information on DMCA copyright enforcement or other legal issues, please contact: http://www.firstamendment.com\n \n Note: Nothing contained on this site is intended as legal advice. Please consult with a competent copyright attorney for advice on proper use of this application and enforcement of intellectual property rights."

Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16.

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

      "label": "Introducing the Langelier Saturation Index Calculator app for iOS – the ultimate tool for pool owners and professionals. With this app, you can easily and accurately calculate the Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) of your pool water, ensuring that your pool is always properly balanced and healthy for swimmers.\n\nThe Langelier Saturation Index is a measure of the balance between the calcium and alkalinity levels in your pool water. A balanced pool will have an LSI of 0, while a pool with too much calcium will have a positive LSI, and a pool with too little calcium will have a negative LSI. By regularly calculating the LSI of your pool water, you can ensure that it is always properly balanced and safe for swimmers.\n\nUsing the LSI Calculator app is simple: just enter the pH, temperature, total alkalinity, and calcium hardness levels of your pool water, and the app will provide you with an instant calculation of the LSI. You can even save your calculations and track the LSI of your pool over time to monitor changes and make adjustments as needed.\n\nThe LSI Calculator app is a must-have for anyone who wants to keep their pool water healthy and balanced. With its easy-to-use interface and accurate calculations, you'll be able to maintain a safe and enjoyable pool environment for you and your family. Download the app today and take control of your pool's water chemistry.\n\nAlso, water temperature can be entered as Fahrenheit or Celsius. \n\nThis app features: \n\n• Send your calculations or conversions by email \n• Universal App (iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad)\n• Retina Display graphics \n• Fast app switching \n• Automatically Saves Your Inputs \n• Latest version of iOS is supported\n• All iPhone and iPad screens sizes are supported\n• Export to CSV\n\nNo network connectivity required."

      "label": "Use the XR-3 Remote companion app to remotely monitor and control Applied Instruments' WiFi enabled XR-3 Modular Test Instrument when paired with a compatible iPhone or iPad.  The iOS mobile device connects to the XR-3 satellite meter using WiFi technology without using any 4G data and without going through the internet.\n\nApplication example: Connect your XR-3 satellite meter at the ground block location and power on the XR-3.  Then pair your XR-3 to your iOS mobile device via WiFi.  Climb the ladder with your phone on an armband, run the XR-3 Remote app, and check signal level and quality and re-align your satellite dish without having to first remove the LNBF head and temporarily connect short coax jumper cables from the LNBF to your satellite meter.  The XR-3 meter's screen is mirrored on your mobile device, allowing you to identify the satellite, toggle to different satellites and transponders and measure RF level, demodulated signal quality, and LNB LO drift.  This method offers safety and speed advantages for the satellite technician.\n\nPresent Limitations:\n1) Only works with XR-3 hardware version 3.01 (XR-3's with optional WiFi hardware module installed).  To confirm the hardware version of your XR-3, press MENU, select Versions from the Main Menu and refer to the Base HW Version field.  If your XR-3 doesn't have hardware version 3.01, contact Applied Instruments for a quote to have it modified.\n2) XR-3 Remote app only works with the XR-3's satellite meter modules.  Support for the cable modules will be coming soon!\n3) Only the XR-3's main Run screen, AZ/EL screens, and limit scan screens are viewable and controllable via the mobile device.  Increased functionality (more screens) will be offered at a later date via software updates.\n4) Only 1 mobile device can be connected to each XR-3 at a time.\n5) WiFi range of iOS mobile device to XR-3 satellite meter varies depending on obstacles and terrain, but is approximately 100 to 300 feet.\n\nWhat do I need to get started?\n1) iPhone or iPad\n2) WiFi Enabled XR-3 Modular Test Instrument (hardware version 3.01) with a related satellite meter module\n\nFor more details about WiFi functions of the WiFi-enabled XR-3, visit http://www.appliedin.com/www/assets/products/XR_3/downloads/XR-3_Meter_WiFi_Operations.pdf\n\nFor more details about the XR-3 Remote iOS app, visit http://www.appliedin.com/www/assets/products/XR_3/downloads/XR-3_Remote_iOS_App.pdf\n\nHow do I link my iOS mobile device to the XR-3?\n1)\tPower on your XR‐3.\n2)\tTurn on Wi‐Fi on your iPhone or iPad if it’s not already enabled.\n3)\tWhen searching on your iOS device for the wireless network that you’d like to join, select the SSID (name) of your\nXR‐3 and enter the password.\n4)\tIn your XR‐3, you can view and modify its related SSID and password by selecting MENU --> WiFi --> \nWiFi Menu --> WiFi Options --> Hands Free Cfg.\n5)\tOn your XR‐3, exit the WiFi menu to return to the meter’s Run screen (where your bar graphs are shown)\n6)\tOn your iPhone or iPad, open the XR‐3 Remote app. The phone will sync with your meter and your meter’s main Run screen display will be mirrored on the phone.\n\nLearn more about the Applied Instruments XR-3 and other Applied Instruments products at www.appliedin.com"

Press power button, you can see signal strength bar moving, then slide the thumb to set the threshold (0.00~1.00), the value will be saved for next time use. \n\n2.If the indicator start flashing, that means a real recording start. check the recorded files,some test files can be found  there . \n\n3.In each scenario, the threshold value could be different, set it according to the situation. For example,for snoring and dream talk recording at night, set the value to 0.05, but at daytime, you probably have to set it at 0.10. \n\n4. Attention for naming a label: all files can be saved to your computer. Label,as a part of a file name, has to follow some rules for different computer OS.For this app, make it simple as follows,the name length is better to be limited to within 125 characters,as for the kind of characters, for Windows,you can't use ?\\|/ etc. in your label, otherwise iTunes will report a error such as no files found, just rename it as windows' requirement to fix it.\n\n\n**About Volume**\nSpeaker mode or earphone mode,  the speaker hardware is shared by all apps in your device, please check both modes and adjust the volume if you can't hear anything.\n\n**How to download recording files**\nFor file downloading,  iTunes File sharing Feature is recommended.

      "label": "Warm up your cold calls with SwiftCall. Swiftly auto dial through intelligently sorted call lists, review detailed analytics of call sessions, and swiftly take follow-up actions without ever leaving the app. Make phone calls without having to dial a number into a keypad. SwiftCall is the way call time was meant to be.\n\nCollaboration is key, and SwiftCall makes it easy to make sales calls as a team with lead sharing and analytics reporting. Stop maintaining that disorganized spreadsheet or scanning your eyes between a notepad and a phone. If you've been calling over 25, 50, or even 100 leads per day, get ready for SwiftCall to completely transform your sales process.\n\nCall Lists:\nManage the lead pipeline intelligently from first contact through close. Create leads or import a CSV with thousands of them and then SwiftCall will do the work of sorting them into call lists. SwiftCall tracks progress with each lead as you call to determine which ones are more promising. \n\nNo need to restart data entry for leads: import a CSV with hundreds or even thousands of leads within seconds. Share leads easily between SwiftCallers to work together as a team.\n\nAnalytics & Achievements:\nIf you can't measure, you can't manage. That's why SwiftCall keeps track of progress from the analytics Dashboard. View charts with calls, deals, and revenue per day. It’s like a fitness tracker for business growth. Review call logs and achievements earned to measure long-term performance. Create reports from the Dashboard to show off your performance to the team.\n\nFollow-Up Actions:\nCall time doesn’t just stop with the call. You want to stay fresh in the mind of your lead so they know that their time is valued. That’s why SwiftCall can quickly send follow-up emails or text messages as a follow-up. The Planner then helps schedule the next call and creates notifications for when the time comes to call again. If you have it enabled, Siri Suggestions will also prompt you right before your scheduled call, allowing you to tap the notification to dial in.\n\nMaybe you are hustling to build your business, or perhaps you work on a sales team with big dreams. Maybe you are a fundraiser at a non profit. Regardless of where you come from, we are here to help. Our reviewers brag about receiving service within seconds, and you won’t find a better deal for your sales budget: everything is included upon download, with no subscriptions or in-app purchases. Plus you get an Apple Watch app for when you want to use SwiftCall on the go.

Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

This is more than what is available on the FEMA site; it automatically completes the SFHDF form including the Community and map panel information, and provides a map showing the property with the FEMA / NFIP overlay!\n\nFLOOD ZONE quickly and easily gives you the FEMA designated flood zone of your current location or a point you choose on a map. Real estate agents, insurance agents, GIS professionals, surveyors, landowners and anyone with an interest in flood related products or services will find this app's subscription service easy, quick and very affordable. \n\nRealtors and Real estate agents: Add value to the service you provide. Top agents are knowledgeable of flood zones. Areas with a significant risk of flooding can be located miles away from bodies of water or rivers, and lender-required flood insurance can put a reasonably priced home out of the reach of some buyers. Use FLOOD ZONE to identify these properties and save yourself and buyers time and frustration. Listing agents and sellers can benefit too. Purchasers need to know that increases in flood insurance premiums are affected by a property’s flood zone. The FLOOD ZONE app helps listing agents and sellers determine what they need to disclose when placing a home on the market. \n\nHome Owners: FLOOD ZONE can help you monitor if your property’s flood zone has changed because of flood map redrawing. Are you near the boundary of two different zones? Use FLOOD ZONE to see how close you are to higher risk. \n\nFLOOD ZONE shows FEMA approved flood hazard maps using National Flood Insurance Program data that is updated regularly. FLOOD ZONE is an informational tool and not a substitute for an elevation certificate performed by a qualified professional. Data is believed accurate but not guaranteed. This app is NOT an official NFIP or FEMA publication. Please refer to official FEMA and NFIP resources and appropriately qualified professionals for all related determinations.\n\nYou can customize the map to hide or show FIRM Panels, Flood Hazard Zones, LOMRs, LOMAs, River Mile Markers, Coastal Gages, Base Flood Elevations, Water Lines, Coastal Barrier Resources System Area, and Levees.\n\nThe app REQUIRES an auto-renew subscription to the online flood zone maps, offered as an in-app purchase. The app comes with a free trial of access to the flood zone maps before you have to buy anything.\n\nThere is an OPTIONAL auto-renew subscription to create Flood Hazard Determination PDF documents, offered as an in-app purchase. \n\nDiscounts may be provided for longer subscription periods. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user here: https://goo.gl/8gknaa\n\nSubscription auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\nhttp://www.ikonetics.com/app-site-terms-privacy.html"

Press power button, you can see signal strength bar moving, then slide the thumb to set the threshold (0.00~1.00), the value will be saved for next time use. \n\n2.If the indicator start flashing, that means a real recording start. check the recorded files,some test files can be found  there . \n\n3.In each scenario, the threshold value could be different, set it according to the situation. For example,for snoring and dream talk recording at night, set the value to 0.05, but at daytime, you probably have to set it at 0.10. \n\n4. Attention for naming a label: all files can be saved to your computer. Label,as a part of a file name, has to follow some rules for different computer OS.For this app, make it simple as follows,the name length is better to be limited to within 125 characters,as for the kind of characters, for Windows,you can't use ?\\|/ etc. in your label, otherwise iTunes will report a error such as no files found, just rename it as windows' requirement to fix it.\n\n\n**About Volume**\nSpeaker mode or earphone mode,  the speaker hardware is shared by all apps in your device, please check both modes and adjust the volume if you can't hear anything.\n\n**How to download recording files**\nFor file downloading,  iTunes File sharing Feature is recommended.  The basic steps : connect to iTunes->click \"iPhone\" ->click \"App\"->scroll down to find \"File sharing\"->click this app's icon -> select recording fils on the right box ->click \" Save\". You can also find more details in the help section of iTunes."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

      "label": "Warm up your cold calls with SwiftCall. Swiftly auto dial through intelligently sorted call lists, review detailed analytics of call sessions, and swiftly take follow-up actions without ever leaving the app. Make phone calls without having to dial a number into a keypad. SwiftCall is the way call time was meant to be.\n\nCollaboration is key, and SwiftCall makes it easy to make sales calls as a team with lead sharing and analytics reporting. Stop maintaining that disorganized spreadsheet or scanning your eyes between a notepad and a phone. If you've been calling over 25, 50, or even 100 leads per day, get ready for SwiftCall to completely transform your sales process.\n\nCall Lists:\nManage the lead pipeline intelligently from first contact through close. Create leads or import a CSV with thousands of them and then SwiftCall will do the work of sorting them into call lists.

Share leads easily between SwiftCallers to work together as a team.\n\nAnalytics & Achievements:\nIf you can't measure, you can't manage. That's why SwiftCall keeps track of progress from the analytics Dashboard. View charts with calls, deals, and revenue per day. It’s like a fitness tracker for business growth. Review call logs and achievements earned to measure long-term performance. Create reports from the Dashboard to show off your performance to the team.\n\nFollow-Up Actions:\nCall time doesn’t just stop with the call. You want to stay fresh in the mind of your lead so they know that their time is valued. That’s why SwiftCall can quickly send follow-up emails or text messages as a follow-up. The Planner then helps schedule the next call and creates notifications for when the time comes to call again. If you have it enabled, Siri Suggestions will also prompt you right before your scheduled call, allowing you to tap the notification to dial in.\n\nMaybe you are hustling to build your business, or perhaps you work on a sales team with big dreams.

      "label": "A must have for Professional Snow Plowers!  Plus it keeps getting better with each update!  Get the edge over your competition.\n\nHow long do you have to snow plow to pay for this app?  Minutes!  Think of it as less than the cost of (2) bags of ice melt or roughly 5% of a new cutting edge on your plow .  Think of it as the cheapest thing you will buy for your snow removal business besides the snacks at the gas station.  \n\nRead everything below to understand why it's worth purchasing....\n\nSnowClient was created by someone that has been in your shoes (snow boots), snow plowing through the night to have the properties clear by morning.\n\nThink about it!  No more clipboards, paper, and handwriting.  Handwriting that is hard to read and takes forever to organize to be able to invoice snow customers after the snow storm is over.  All the while you are hoping that your paperwork notes don't blow away, fall in the snow, or get stolen.  Then how are you supposed to know what hours to bill for and all the other information that was on that piece of paper?  The SnowClient app takes care of all of this.  \n\nWith SnowClient it is easy to document all the work you do and have it immediately organized and accessible in case your snow removal clients want to know when you serviced their property or how deep the snow was when you did service it.  You will have the info at your fingertips and will impress them with your ability to know the facts on the spot.\n\nNo more hours spent calculating your hours for each property to know what to put on the invoice.  It is done the moment you finish servicing the snow account and push stop.\n\nThen when invoicing, all you do is use the sort feature to filter by property and you have all the information you need to invoice for that specific property!\n\nYou can also sort by date and team leader (this could be the driver).\n\nAlso if you put the full address into the property info you or your employees can just click on it to get directions to that property.\n\nSimplify your snow business and minimize the headaches & work after the snow storm.   \n\nSnowClient Helps You Keep Track of:\n\n- Property Names\n\n- Property Details (Address, Deadline Time, Etc.)\n\n- Time Spent Working at Each Property\n\n- Employee Information (if needed)\n\n- Amounts of Salt or De-icing Materials Used at Each Property to be Billed for Later\n\n- Additional Notes - Write Notes and Other Messages That Are Unique to Your Company's Way of Doing Business or Other Information You Would Like but There is no Spot For it.\n\n- Which Employees Serviced Which Properties\n(Employees on the job)\n\nSnowClient Also Will:\n\n- Assist in Accurate Billing\n\n- Keep Work Information Organized\n\n- Create Documentation to Help in Legal Matters\n\n- And So Much More in the Future!\n\n***What this app does NOT do:\n\n- Store Your Information in the Cloud (all the info is stored on your phone)\n\n- Login for Different Users or Privileges\n\n- Sync Information Across Different Users Devices \n\n- Export to Excel or Quickbooks BUT there IS exporting (text, email, etc.)\n\n- Print (unless you export to notes then you can print from notes)\n\nWe know there are probably a lot more features including the ones listed under \"What this app is not\" that you would like to be able to have to help you manage your snow removal properties, snow removal employees, and snow removal customers.  \n\nPLEASE share your ideas with us so we can incorporate them into the app to better serve your needs.  We want to make sure you are satisfied!  We would like to see all 5 Star Reviews so help us out and give us feedback before slamming us with a bad review.  If your life is better because of this app then give us a good review:)  As snow plowers we know what it is like to only hear complaints and on the other side how good it feels when somebody appreciates the work we performed.\n\nSend us a message on our Facebook page by following the Support Link.  We are here for you!"

For Hourly calculation please enter rate and hours (OT, DT) and the Gross Pay amount will be automatically calculated!\n-----------------------------------------\n\nUnlimited profiles \n-----------------------------------------\nPayroll Guru app allows for unlimited number of profiles to cover every employee or a group of similarly taxed employees. Profiles can be saved and edited and include state, marital status, pay period, allowances and deductions information.\n\n8 pre-tax or post-tax deductions\n-----------------------------------------\nPayrollguru app allows up to 8 pre-tax and/or post-tax deductions, which are setup as a fixed amount deduction or a % of gross pay. Deductions are customizable and can differ from one profile to another. The deductions can be modified to accommodate various taxing scenarios. For example for 401K deduction - select pretax and turn ON Federal and State switches to exclude it from being taxed on federal and state levels.\n\nOnce you enter all information and include year-to-date gross paid wages, Payroll Guru will calculate your net paycheck amount and will show you the appropraite taxes.\n\nPayroll Guru calculates the following taxes: \n- Federal WIthholding, \n- Social Security, \n- Medicare, \n- State Withholding, \n- State Unemployment (where applicable), \n- State Disability Insurance (where applicable). \n\nCalculated paychecks can be viewed as a pie chart showing the percentage distribution of your gross pay. Paycheck details can be emailed to an employee, employer or a payroll service provider. \n\nPayrollguru app is a must have for any self-employed person or employer in the US to calculate paychecks and verify accuracy of issued paychecks. \n\nPayrollguru app will also be useful to any employee looking to improve financial planning, budget spending and estimate impact of personal changes (i.e. marital status, number of dependents) on net take home amount. \n\nEmployees can also use Payroll Guru app to compare net paycheck amounts (after tax) in different states. This will be useful for employees considering job or relocation to a different state.  \n\nFor small business owners and payroll service providers Payrollguru will help estimate net and gross paycheck amounts in a particular payroll situation, and will provide a pretty accurate assessment of applicable payroll taxes.\n\nPayrollguru app calculates payroll taxes for all 50 states and District of Columbia. \n\nIf you have any improvement suggestions or would like to report a problem please email us directly at support@payrollguru.mobi. \n\nWe also appreciate your positive feedback and reviews. Thank you for using Payroll Guru app. Enjoy it!"

See why tens of thousands of engineers, technicians, and architects have licensed our software for their HVAC engineering needs.\n\n(For full online help, click here: http://bit.ly/1GlRulY.\n\nFor training webinar, click here: http://bit.ly/1IHn7nA)\n\nThis app now includes the HVAC Equipment Locator. Click here for details: http://bit.ly/1yTq539.\n\nThis app allows you to perform detailed block and room-by-room heating and cooling loads for residential buildings out in the field, by taking advantage of the simplicity and power of the iPhone.\n\nThis app was designed by Carmel Software Corporation, a 25-year old software design firm specializing in engineering analysis software applications. We are not just 1 person designing mobile apps out of a bedroom. We are a team of software developers and engineers with over 50 years combined software and engineering design experience. In fact, our software powers the analysis capabilities of major Autodesk (The makers of AutoCAD) software tools such as Autodesk Revit. \n\nThe following is just a small sample of the features included in this app:\n\n1. Calculations based upon abridged ACCA Manual J8 calculations (This is not an ACCA-approved app. For our ACCA-approved iPad app, search for the HVAC ResLoad-J app on the app store)\n\n2. Includes a 1000+ world-wide city weather database\n\n3. Includes data for 100s of construction types for walls, roofs, floors, doors, windows, skylights, ceilings, and more\n\n4. Allows you to create and store an unlimited number of projects\n\n5. Allows you to create an unlimited number of rooms and view individual loads and airflows for those rooms\n\n6. Allows you to specify an unlimited # of opaque types (ie – doors, walls, roofs, floors, ceilings), window types, and skylight types for each building\n\n7. Allows you to instantly view total heating and cooling load results as you update input data\n\n8. Allows you to view comprehensive cooling and heating load breakdown reports including breakdown by opaque load, window load, skylight load, infiltration load, ventilation load and internal load contributions\n\n9. Opaque inputs include opaque type, opaque construction number, dimensions, and opening areas\n\n10. Window inputs include window type, internal and external shading type, overhang dimensions, window area, and more..\n\n11. Additional input types include # of people, # of bedrooms, ventilation airflow, and more..\n\n12. Includes ability to display a wide variety of on-screen reports including checksum reports (ie – BTUh/SqFt, SqFt/Ton, etc.), complete heating and cooling load breakdown reports, and even graphically-pleasing pie charts showing cooling and heating load breakdowns\n\n13. Includes the ability to display a comprehensive HTML report that you can email to yourself or others, and it also includes a spreadsheet attachment that you can open in Excel to further massage data on your desktop\n\n14. Includes English (IP) or Metric (SI) units\n\n15. This is the same technology that powers the Trane MAP iPad app that they offer to their elite dealer network\n\nThe benefits of using this app are numerous including:\n\n1. Great for use out in the field. Quickly size heating and cooling equipment, show the client, then email the results back to your office for further analysis.\n\n2. Show off your advanced on-screen reports to clients convincing them you are using cutting-edge technology\n\n3. Save time by inputting information in the field and then returning to your office to perform more in-depth analysis"

Choose an editing option (you can select “unenhanced”)\n3. Easily adjust the scan area using the 4 borders on the page\n4. Confirm the scan to the set dimensions (ready presets available)\n5. Choose filters to enhance the quality (optional)\n6. Save and Export into a PDF or JPG \n7.

If you are looking for a mobile scanning application that automatically detects borders, corrects distortion, and equalizes brightness to create clear, legible documents, you are definitely on the right page.\n\n\nSpeaking of great user experience and automatic functions, the MDScan integrates seamlessly with cloud storage services such as Google Drive and Dropbox. In addition, you can send your scanned documents with email services, Facebook (Messenger), Twitter, and other apps if installed on your device. \n\n\nThis scanner app shines in terms of uploading but has no second when it comes to converting pictures taken from your phone's camera into legitimate documents you can use for business purposes. \n\n\nWith the Mobile Doc Scanner (MDScan) + OCR, you can now add multiple pages easier than ever.

There is a feature called “Process page laters (spy mode)” that allows you to scan as many documents as you want to without facing any processing delays. \n\n\nOf course, you can work with a photo or document that is already saved in your file system. Whether a PDF file or a regular picture, you can use the same editing options as if you just scanned a picture with your camera. \n\n\nAnother great feature this document scanner app offers is OCR (Optical Character Recognition) which stands for the electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. Whether scanned from a PDF file or a photo you just took, this new version of Mobile Doc Scanner (MDScan) + OCR guarantees fast performance, user-friendly interface, and professional results. \n\n\nLet’s sum up what you get downloading the MDScan:\n\n\n* Convert any image into a PDF format. \n* Document edge detection and perspective correction.\n* Improved image quality\n* Quick scan and multi-page documents\n* Share easily and upload instantly\n\nUser satisfaction is our main goal and if you have any questions or suggestions on how we can improve the Mobile Doc Scanner (MDScan) + OCR, contact us at our support email.

      "label": "Ditch the office scanner!\nJust snap a photo of your document, and get a PDF file you can instantly send to your colleagues, all from your iPhone or iPad.\n\nTACK SHARP SCANS\nThat processor in your phone is quite a little monster. Smart PDF Scanner uses it fully to make the best possible scans. Even full-page articles come out tack-sharp and easy to read.\n\nIt automatically detects the page edges and corrects for perspective. Pick full-color scans, grayscale, or black-and-white for maximum legibility. FlashAssist can take perfect scans even in poor lighting conditions. You can even change the correction and enhancement settings after the fact.\n\nPOWERFUL COLOR-CODED ORGANIZATION\nScanning is just half the problem. You need a good way to keep all your documents organized, and easy to find later. Smart PDF Scanner uses a simple tagging system that is much easier and more powerful than the regular folder system. File documents under custom color-coded categories with just a couple taps. Browse and sort files by category with a couple more.\n\nIt's the way filing should work.\n\nEASY TO SHARE\nExport scans as PDFs or images, and email or print directly from the App. Files can also be shared via AirDrop, or sent to another App.\n\nEasily upload to Dropbox, Google Drive, and other cloud services with the corresponding third party App. Send PDFs and images to services such as Evernote or OneNote to take advantage of their OCR capabilities.\n\nFOR ALL YOUR SCANNING NEEDS\n+ Quickly scan and send contracts and forms\n+ Keep scans of important documents in your pocket, separate form the Photo Library\n+ Scan all your travel receipts for easy expense reports\n+ Keep digital copies of your notes and sketches\n+ Scan articles and send them to iBooks to read on the go\n+ And more!\n\nAPPS BUILT FOR PROFESSIONALS\nSmart PDF Scanner uses the latest technologies packed into your iPhone and iPad, but we've worked hard to make it as easy and fast to use as possible. Intelligent image processing eliminates the need for fiddling with complicated controls. That way, you can focus on getting the job done, and doing what you do best.\n\nTIPS AND TRICKS\nHere are a few tips to get the best scans:\n+ Place your document on a darker surface to improve the edge auto-detection.\n+ You can drag the corners of the blue rectangle to fine tune it after taking a photo.\n+ Make sure there is adequate lighting. Use the flash in low-light conditions.\n+ You can tap on a page to edit its scan settings (including edges) after the fact.\n\nMADE BY DEVELOPERS WHO CARE\nWe are dedicated to handcrafting the best possible Apps for your iPhone and iPad, and we hope you enjoy using Smart PDF Scanner. If you have any additional questions, please drop us a line via our feedback page.\n\nBest regards,\n\n-- The App Makers @ Qrayon."

      "label": "PDF Compressor makes it possible for anyone to reduce your PDF documents size, especially useful for those PDF files with many scan graphics and photos. \n\nPortable Document Format (PDF) files are the open, standard way to deliver documents electronically. Supported by virtually any platform—Windows, Mac OS, Linux—converted PDF documents, graphics, charts, and forms look exactly as they would if they were printed. At times, it is necessary to compress these files to be able to send them as email attachments or upload them to websites. There are many options for compressing PDF files\n\n> Be Smart for Mobile Phones - Compress that PDF!\nWith more website visitors using mobile devices, why treat them like second class citizens by including large PDF's on your website, email or app? Use PDF Compressor to shrink the files and make them more friendly for mobile users.\n\n> Emailing PDFs?\nWhy clog up the inbox of your friends and co-workers? Compress the PDF file before you email it, that way they'll not only get there faster but be quicker to open. Don't forget major mail providers have a file size limit of around 20MB, so compressing PDFs also means that attachments are more likely to arrive.\n\n> Perfect quality!\nReduce your scanned PDF files to 144dpi which is perfect for uploading files to the web and through email on mobile phones.\n\n> Balance between image quality and storage size\nPDF Compressor reduces file size by compressing the images within PDF document. It uses JPEG, which is a commonly used method of lossy compression for image. So you can get high quality but small PDF file after compression. For some PDF files, file size can be reduced by 90%.\n\nKey Features: \n• Really attractive, super easy to use interface.\n• Import PDF from Mail, Safari, PDF Reader, GoodReader, Dropbox and other apps. \n• Mail out documents as email attachments or Send files to other apps(\"Open In..\" integration). \n• Share and Compress files to .zip file. \n• File manager, rename, copy, move, delete and compress. \n• Paste file(s) from clipboard (Add files from other app). \n• Copy file to clipboard (Used for mail or other app). \n• Wifi file transfer (Use Web Browser or WebDAV clients to Upload or Download files). \n• USB file transfer (iTunes USB file sharing). \n• Print PDF or Word to AirPrint-enable printers. \n\nSupport both iPhone and iPad! \n\nPDF Compressor compresses your PDF files on your iPhone and iPad to a perfect size that is still good quality, You can send smaller and faster emails, save your storage space, decrease file upload or download times after reducing file size of PDF documents. \n\nSeveral sample files have been included, you can test it right now! \n\nWe are continuously developing PDF to Word, so please feel free to contact us with your questions, suggestions or any problems, and we will reply ASAP."

      "label": "With the training acquired within this Fire Alarm Trainer App, not only will you will learn how to look up and answer fire alarm related questions; but also learn the keywords you would use to answer them. In addition, each question has extensive explanations to understand the concepts and not just the answers. With content designed by Fire Alarm Industry Experts, each question has been specifically worded to simulate what an actual exam would include. From fire alarm symbol identification to device load calculations, the app is packed with years of experience that will allow you to not only learn the ways the questions are asked, but learn the key words within the questions.\n\nAll questions are broken into major topics to allow you to focus on a specific topic. Topics include:\n\n-          Circuits and Pathways\n-          Field Installations\n-          Safety\n-          Testing and Inspecting\n\nFire Alarm Trainer Level I correlates to NICET Level I and all content has been based on the versions of the Code Books that NICET bases the test on, e.g., NFPA 72 version 2013, NEC 70 version 2011. In addition, a Safety Quiz has been included that has been based on the most up-to-date OSHA rules.\n\nNearly 100 questions are included in this extensive bank of practice questions that, put together, create the most highly valued Fire Alarm Practice Test that you will find. With questions being shuffled at every attempt, the content continues to teach even after numerous rounds of studying."

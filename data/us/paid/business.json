      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14.

      "label": "Voice Answer gives answers on many topics and can assist you with a lot of tasks. The stunning 3D robot can chat with you, answer detailed questions and can guide and help you. \n\nThe knowledge base behind the app contains 'Wolfram Alpha', which gives you an enormous amount of information in your pocket. \nWith Voice Answer, you have full and unlimited access to this knowledge. \n\nExamples of topics and specific questions and commands: \n\nText: 'Send text to George I will be late' \n\nEmail: 'Email John Let's get together this week.' \n\nCall: 'Call mom' \n\nTranslation: 'Translate I would like to go now into Spanish' \n\nPlay songs on your device: 'Play music by Adele' \n\nReminder: 'Set reminder to 5 pm' \n\nSocial media: 'Post to Facebook This is great', 'Tweet I am going home now' \n\nSearch: 'Google this','Wiki that' \n\nLocation: 'Where am I?' \n\nPlaces: 'Where is the nearest bank?' \n\nMathematics: 'Integrate sin x dx from x=0 to pi' \n\nUnits & Measures 'U.K. men's size 11 shoe in Japanese size' \n\nMoney & Finance 'What is the Apple stock price' \n\nDates & Times 'What is the current time in Tokyo?' \n\nCurrent Weather 'What will be the high temperature today?' \n\nHealth & Medicine 'What is the life expectancy of a U.S. female age 30?' \n\nPlaces & Geography 'Where is ZIP 60637?' \n\nSocioeconomic Data 'Compare the age pyramid of New York and Miami' \n\nPeople & History 'When did Gandhi die?' \n\nFood & Nutrition '2 slices of swiss cheese' \n\nPhysics: 'What is the speed of light?' \n\nMaterials: 'Show me Topaz' \n\nEducation: 'How many kids are repeating primary school in California?' \n\nCulture & Media: 'US constitution' \n\nOrganizations: 'New York University' \n\nAstronomy:'Star chart' \n\nTransportation: 'Compare total length of all roads in USA and China' \n\nWords & Linguistics: 'Show me words that rhyme with bear' \n\nEarth Sciences: 'When was the Jurassic Period?' \n\nLife Sciences:'Compare puma, lion, red fox' \n\nSports & Games:'San Francisco Giants' \n\nWeb & Computer Systems: 'What is the cheapest tablet?' \n\nColors: 'What do you get when you mix red and blue' \n\nThe answers are spoken out, and relevant images are given. \n\nYou can also just have a general chat with Eve. Test her witty personality or just ask her to tell a joke or two. \n\nCommon Questions and concerns: \n\nQ: Why do I get strange answers to my question? \nA: Voice Answer will first check it's knowledge servers, including Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha's award winning service, for an answer. If these don't respond, either because the answer is unavailable or the servers are down, the chatbot will answer the question. These answers are generally more funny than useful. You can avoid strange answers by disabling the chatbot, and try your question later. We are further enhancing our current data sources with additional databases as these become available, as we want to offer our customers the very best. \n\nQ: What do I do when voice answer doesn't understand my voice? \nA: Voice Answer compares your voice against a database of spoken english words and sentences. It works better for some people than for others. In general it works better than the voice recognition used by many other apps, but it depends on your accent. Try to speak slow and use regular sentences. If this doesn't work, you can use the keyboard. As and when better voice recognition algorithms are developed and become available, we can and will plug these in. \n\nQ: The app crashes. What can I do? \nA: On some devices such as the iPad1 or 3GS, it may sometimes be required to do a hard reset to get it to work. If this fails, removing the app and installing it again will generally get it going. We are working on improving the stability on those devices. \n\nPlease contact us at support@sparklingapps.com for any questions or comments. If you have any problems with any of the functions of the app, we can assist you with it. We are proud of our product and want our customers to get the most out of it."

I am self-employed so it was very difficult to track the sudden callouts and things that just come up on a daily basis. This makes it simple and fast. I think the simplicity is what makes it so perfect. - Shane Domo\n\n* Perfect app for tracking hours worked for different customers. Not overly complicated. Most useful app I have. - SeabeeChief\n\n* This app is very simple to use and powerful. Frederic is very quick to reply to any questions about support ... - Brendoniuis\n\n* It becomes second nature the moment you start using it. No need to learn how to use it as it's based on Apple's iOS ... -kgat03\n\niTimeClock is a simple application that will allow you to track the number of hours you work on a project.

      "label": "Version 2.0 Available Now!!\nNow more handsomer, faster, and even more feature packed than ever (New Invoice Section*!).\n\nTimecard Pro is a multi-use app to keep track of your hours worked and your work schedule. It's great for freelance workers, employers to track their employees, or for anyone who wants to see a live view of how much money they're earning. The possibilities of utilizing the app are endless.\n\nSimply add your Job(s) or employees, and then clock in and out whenever needed. At the end of your pay period, you can export your timecards and email a report to your boss or client. Need to clock into multiple jobs, and have a different hourly rate for each? Not a problem, Timecard Pro can handle all of this, without breaking a sweat.\n\n----------------------------------------- \n\nWhat our users are saying: \n\n\"I love it...Life is easy now\" \n\n\"Top Notch, Solid, & Reliable...Click & Forget\" \n\n\"Design and Navigation Success!\" \n\n----------------------------------------- \n\n\nUniversal application: Purchase once, use on both your iPhone and iPad.\n\nFeatures: \n- Easy to use, intuitive interface. Simple, single touch \"Clock in/Clock Out\" dial for on-the-go time tracking.\n- Calendar section allows you to add your work shifts, with pop-up push reminders for when you work, as well as the ability to manually add timecards, and view all of the days you worked or have work scheduled. \n- Users:  Add unlimited users within the app, all with their own separate data. Protect each user data with a password lock.\n- Reports page lets you export multiple Pay Periods, regardless of job, all in the same email with Text, CSV, and PDF export options.\n- 2 Data Backup options, including Email Export, and a built-in 'Restore Data' section.\n- Main display shows money earned, clocked-in time, and how many hours you've worked.\n- Use the menu button on the homepage, to quickly select the job/employee you need to clock into.\n- Clock into multiple jobs/employees at the same time.\n- Icon badge indicator shows how many jobs you're currently clocked into without having to open the app.\n- Set up a different hourly rate for each job.\n- Calculate both daily and weekly overtime hours at the same time.\n- Remain clocked in, even if you turn your phone off! No need to keep the app open. \n- Manually add individual days that you’ve missed.\n- Manually edit timecards to change clocked in/out times, add notes, etc... \n- Add notes for each job or day, and include them in your exported timecard (setting turned on by default). \n- Change Currency Symbol for your specific region.\n- Passcode lock: require a passcode to access app.\n- Automatic 24hr mode detected.\n- Manually sync data between multiple devices, using the backup options. \n- 2 themes (Dark or Light). \n- Updated and optimized for iOS 9. \nAnd many MANY more features to come! \n\niPad version:\n- Completely designed for the iPad, in landscape mode.  With a split screen multi-task feature, you can constantly see the home page on the left to clock in/out of jobs as needed, while you navigate the rest of the app on the right side of the screen.\n\n*In-App Purchase:\n- Invoices:  Create invoices from pay periods, and manually add items (expenses, mileage, etc...).  A beautifully designed invoice will be created, in which a PDF version can be emailed, printed, saved to your Dropbox, or shared.\n\n\nNote to Employers: \nEmployers can add Employees under the \"Jobs\" page instead of entering job names. You can then use the menu from the Home Page to select your employee once they arrive at work, just like a 'job'. Each employee can be set up with a different hourly rate, having their own timecards, etc... \n\nWe love to hear your suggestions!! \nWithout your ideas, we can't shape this app into what YOU need. \nPlease email us at: support@eveleighstudios.com \n\n**Before leaving negative feedback, please contact us to see if we can help you with your concerns. Emails are typically responded within 24 hours."

Now with Scripting and Siri Shortcuts support!\n\nAccounts, recipes, expenses, inventory — life is full of things that we don’t want to forget or misplace. Tap Forms 5 helps you organize all kinds of things in one place — secure, searchable, and accessible on your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch (Mac app sold separately).\n\nHow can one app organize everything? Because not only can you use and customize the more than 30 built-in templates but you can create your own “forms” for inputting any kind of information, even if that information includes pictures, doodles, audio recordings, calculations, file attachments, ratings, or even links to other forms. This makes it almost like building your very own customized organization app.\n\n• Capture your way: Snap a picture, type or scribble some text, record an audio note, scan a barcode — there are 23 different types of information that can be captured with Tap Forms\n\n• Organize your way: Create and design custom forms exactly how you want to for optimal organization. Get started with one of our ready-to-go form templates, or easily make a custom one from scratch with our integrated form building tools.\n\n• Store confidential data with confidence: Tap Forms' security settings let you optionally require a password or a Touch ID scan, and even auto-lock when idle for a custom period of time.

Then, export the layout as an image, or as a CSV file.\n\nThe app supports multiple rack designs.\n\nRather than incorporating a vast symbol library, by allowing you to select the device icon from your device gallery, you can feature symbols, manufacturer logos or other appropriate images.\n\nDevice colours can be separated into industry standards, blue for audio, green for video, or be adjusted to suit your company brand colours.\n\nThe app is designed to provide rack layout only, and does not allow for connections to be shown between devices."

      "label": "Launch your discreet, skillful campaign for power at work: immediately.\n\n“Foundations” is the first in a series of apps that provide discreet, on-the-job training in the Arts of Power: how to acquire, maintain, and expand your power in the workplace. It is based on the New York Times best-selling book, The 48 Laws of Power, by Robert Greene.\n\n**Thousands of successful users from around the world since June 2011**\n\nThis system does not provide you with sugar-coated, politically correct sayings and exercises. Nor does it offer the ubiquitous “secret-formula” for rapid success still used by charlatans to this day.\n\nReal, lasting power is gained by seeing the world clearly (no matter how ugly some of it may be), and by playing the game of power: subtly, skillfully, and in a way that reflects your own uniqueness.\n\nPlay this social game wisely, and not only will you maximize your power, you will do so in a way that is fun AND profoundly reflects who you are.\n\nRemember: power isn’t the problem, powerlessness is.\n\nCONTENTS\nThe Foundations app utilizes:\n- 25 audio sessions + 5 Bonus sessions (approx. 15 min. each, 9hrs in total)\n- 4 Integrated Tools (always accessible)\n- A member’s web site (for home use)\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nIdeally, listen to one audio session on the way to work, as a morning briefing for your day ahead.\n\nWhile you listen, you are given the opportunity to reflect on how various portions of Greene’s text (plus real-world business examples) relate to your situation. Each session ends with a suggested action designed to help you discreetly and skillfully enhance your power that day at work. \n\nEach session also brings you closer to revealing and strengthening the Foundations of your power: the powerful skills, behaviours and perspectives you already have to some degree. Refine these, and it not only increases your power immediately at work, it also gives you the solid base you need to add power-enhancing capabilities that are new to you.\n\nDuring the day you record any observations or planned actions within the four integrated tools.\n\nThe four tools are: \n1) REFLECTOR: Self Assessment\n2) DOSSIER: Analyzing the people you work with\n3) STRATEGY: Your plans to enhance your power\n4) PERSONA: A vision of the most powerful - and sustainable - aspects of your character that you should present to the world\n\nAs you complete each audio session, a new element is released within one of the tools to help you quickly record your observations and strategies.\n\nBy the time you finish the primary 25 sessions, the observations you have made, and strategies you have designed in the four tools, guide you along your own, unique pathway to mastery. Listen to the sessions again and again, or just keep refining and adding to what you’ve entered within the tools.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO OUR V1.X USERS:\nRobert Greene has been following the development and testing of this unique mastery system over the years. It was directly through the insightful feedback from our first generation users - and the endlessly practical wisdom of Greene’s work - that the 5 new bonus sessions 26-30 came to be. \n\nWARNING! Action-based program\nPursuing mastery requires taking real-world action: however since AMS cannot know your exact situation, this app provides you with suggested actions.  These actions are specific enough to be understood, but must be adapted to fit your unique disposition and situation. Therefore, we cannot know what form your final actions will take or be responsible for any consequences.\n\nRest assured however, Mastering The 48 Laws of Power is all about taking wise, subtle action."

      "label": "This app offers four different calculations and shows the results both in a pane and on a psychrometric diagram:\r\n1. Air treatment\r\n   Calculates how to convert a given ambient air to a required design air. The steps involved are cooling with a given sensible heat factor, dehumidifying, heating and humidifying (adiabatic or steam). Depending on the given and required air conditions, some of these steps may not be needed.\r\n\r\n2. Capacities\r\n   Calculates the required capacity to cool down or heat up a given amount of air (e.g. air in your room).\r\n\r\n3. Heat exchanger\r\n   Calculates how warm room air heats up cool ambient air before supplying it as fresh air to the room. While heating up the ambient air, the heat exchanger cools down the room air, which may result in condensate. When the ambient air would be too cold, this calculation dimensions an electric heater to prevent condensate.\r\n\r\n4. Carburetor icing\r\n   Given a temperature and a dew point temperature, calculates the probability of icing in an airplane carburetor. Graphically shows the danger zones on a diagram.\r\n\r\nThese four calculations show the results in a pane, but also graphically in a diagram. You can choose between three different diagrams:\r\n1. Psychrometric\r\n   This is the classic diagram representing different kinds of air properties into a single diagram. You find detailed descriptions in standard books about air treatment, such as ASHRAE. This diagram shows lines of constant temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy and specific volume.\r\n\r\n2. Mollier\r\n   This is probably the oldest diagram to represent air properties and named after its inventor Richard Mollier (1863-1935). To get a psychrometrics diagram from a Mollier diagram, swap it along the vertical axis and rotate it 90°.\r\n   The Mollier diagram is heavily used in Eastern Europe and Germany and shows the same lines as in the psychrometrics diagram.\r\n\r\n3. Dewpoint\r\n   This diagram is meant for meteorologists and pilots. It is easy to read important weather data, such as temperature, dew point and relative humidity. However, this diagram shows the same constant lines as for the other two. Interestingly, the straight lines in the other two diagrams become curved lines in this one and vice versa.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n- Select two air properties to define a point: dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy, specific volume and moist air density.\r\n- No need for a keyboard. Enter data using buttons for small and large value increments.\r\n- Choose between metric or imperial unit dimensions, e.g. °C and °F or kW and BTU/h.\r\n- See immediate results of any change on the diagrams and the result panel shows detailed information about a point on the diagram.\r\n- Choose one of the diagram types (Psychrometrics, Mollier or Dewpoint) for the graphical results. Hide some constant lines on the selected diagram to simplify it. Define colors for the diagram lines and the background gradient.\r\n- Define the efficiency properties of a heat exchanger, giving you professional results.\r\n- Tap the explain tab to get a short explanation of a calculation or a diagram.\r\n- Zoom in (two fingers gesture) and pan (one finger gesture) to enlarge and move a part of the diagram.\r\n- The app saves your latest settings and starts up with those settings.\r\n- Supports five languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Dutch), which you can set in the preferences.\r\n- Supports light and dark themes."

      "label": "The Hidden Secrets to Profitability That Most Business Consultants Don't Want You To Know Are Just A Click Away.\r\n\r\n“If You Want To Grow Your Business Even Faster, This Little App Is Like Helium For A Balloon.”\r\n\r\n“We frequently need to price our products to sell well. Break-Even Analysis is one way to be sure that you are on the right track before you make a costly mistake.”\r\n\r\nB/E Analysis helps you to predict the sales volume required to reach your break-even point where your total cost equals your total revenue.  \r\n\r\nThe App goes one step further and suggests ways to help you increase your profits using your own input as a guide.\r\n\r\nIn 20 Seconds or Less You Can Now Get A Break-Even Analysis Done On Your iPhone!\r\n\r\nYes, Any Product, Any Service and Any Business - Even iPhone Development Projects Can Benefit From This App.\r\n\r\nAll you need to start are 4 basic numerical inputs and the desire to increase your bottom line profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO IS THIS APP FOR:\r\n- Small & Medium Sized Business Owners and Managers\r\n- Corporate Managers That Want A Quick Tool To Guide Them To Higher Profits\r\n- Shareholders, Stakeholders & Entrepreneurs\r\n\r\n\"I used it and decided to go with a 4% price increase. Customers didn’t even notice, my sales numbers stayed the same and it looks like this thing helped me to double my profits. I am blown away”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WILL THIS APP DO FOR YOU:\r\nBreak-Even Analysis is a report NOT normally produced by your accountant, nor is it automatically generated by most accounting software.\r\n\r\nRecent massive layoffs at large corporations are the direct result of an attempt to lower the break-even point of the target business to stay competitive, remain in business and try to increase profits at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf you run a business or a business division and you like to put more money into your pocket, knowing the Break-Even Point for any given product (or project) immediately tells you the lowest amount of business activity necessary to prevent losses. Armed with this information you can tweak your business to get more out of it.\r\n\r\nDo you know your business's Break-Even Point?\r\nWhat about the B/E Point for each of the products you sell?\r\n\r\n\r\nIS IT COMPLICATED:\r\nWe spent months breaking the process down into its core components and then building it back up again as an easy to use business tool. A group of young entrepreneurs gave us feedback after 60 days of using the tool before we went back to our developers and improved it all over again. Now it's your turn, take the App for a spin, use it in your business and let us know what you have achieved.\r\n\r\nAll you need to get going are four things: \r\n-\tThe cost to produce one unit of your product\r\n-\tYour Fixed Costs like rent, utilities and salaries\r\n-\tYour Sales Forecast for a given period and \r\n-\tYour Selling Price for the product\r\n\r\nHere's what a few of our Customers had to say about Break-Even Analysis.\r\n\r\n\"For an iPhone application, this thing is pricey but if you're in business, you'll probably figure out how to earn more money by using it just once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Breakeven is a no-brainer. Used properly, it'll help your business. Thanks again for the free bonus\"\r\n\r\n\"Knowing the elements of break-even analysis focused me on managing the costs that maximize our bottom line.  We definitely make more money today.\"\r\n\r\n“This little App works beautifully with the Apple iTunes Store rev share model. I love what you did with Sales Calc and Break-Even is even better - keep it coming”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS INCLUDED:\r\nIf you enter the 4 input variables, and hit the calculate button, your results are displayed immediately for you in the lower half of the screen. If you were to tap on the Profit or Loss text, a few helpful suggestions are displayed – all designed to improve your bottom line. To view your B/E point on a chart, be sure you have internet access and then turn the iPhone sideways.\r\n\r\nInstructions, definitions & explanations are all included in the Info area of the App."

      "label": "InerTrak for iPhone and iPad, based on the award-winning desktop InerTrak, is a time-tracking tool for designers, contract workers, lawyers, or anyone who works on multiple projects on an hourly basis. It automatically keeps track of the time you spend on different projects thorughout the day; all you do is click to start and stop the timer.\n\nThe iPad version makes full use of the large screen.\n\nYou can create a list of clients, each with an optional hourly rate.\n\nEach project is associated with a client, and includes an hourly rate (either set automatically from the client's rate, or set individually) which is used to automatically calculate the monetary value of time worked.\n\nA detail view of each project shows the daily totals of both time and money, with the ability to check off days as they are billed. Dates are automatically added when you start the timer, but can also be manually added, if necessary. Time values can be edited, if needed.\n\nProjects can be marked as completed and optionally sorted to the end of the list to get completed projects out of the way of active projects.\n\nA summary view shows the totals of each project -- the total time and money, billed time and money, and unbilled time and money. You can see a summary for any desired time period.\n\nTime values can be displayed in a variety of formats:  hours minutes and seconds; hours and tenths of an hour; hours and sixths of an hour; hours and quarters of an hour; even hours and hundredths of an hour.\n\nYou can create an email message containing the InerTrak data in CSV format. Send it to yourself and then, on your computer, copy and paste the data into Excel or any program that understands CSV format.\n\nYou can add a note or comment to any date. \n\nThe currency symbol can be customized to any one or two characters that you want.\n\nInerTrak for iPhone and iPad is fully integrated with InerTrak for the desktop. You can use InerTrak on your iPhone to keep track of time worked in the field or when away from your desk. Then, with a couple of button clicks, copy that data to the desktop InerTrak and take advantage of more advanced reporting capabilities, print timecards or invoices, etc.\n\nImportant: Data synchronizing requires a wireless network accessible by both your iPhone/iPad and your desktop/laptop computer running InerTrak (version 3.4 or higher). \n\nIf you don't have the desktop InerTrak, you can try it free for 30 days. Download it from www.inertron.com/inertrak.\n\nWhat InerTrak does NOT have:\n\no It has only two levels of terms, Client and Project. It does not allow you to further break down a Project into sub-projects or tasks.\n\no The granularity of time is a day; it keeps track of the total time that you spend on any Project on each day. It does NOT keep track of the individual times that you start and stop the timer throughout the day.\n\nIf you need either of the above features, then InerTrak is not the right product for you.\n\nThere is a detailed user's guide online at: www.inertron.com/mobile/inertrak. The user's guide describes all the features in InerTrak. If there is a feature or capability that you need that is not described there, InerTrak is probably not the right product for you. Feel free, however, to email us and request it; the best way for us to make the product better is to know what people think is missing.\n\nSee a demonstration video of the iPhone version here: www.inertron.com/demo"

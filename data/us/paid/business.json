      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

The segment is now part of your recording!\n\nIf you made a mistake or there is any other problem with the segment, press the Discard button. Record your segment again.\n\nRepeat the process as often as necessary until you have recorded the segment exactly as you want it.\n\nA segment never gets added to your recording until you press Commit.\n\nThis is how you edit as you go, and end up with a perfect recording!\n\nIf you are recording a long work such as an audio book, it is best to divide your work up so the recordings are not too large. Try a chapter per recording.\n\nWhen your recording is complete, you can export it to any location supported by your device.\n\nIt couldn't be much simpler to create a finished recording!"

      "label": "A mainstay for many decades for oil drilling and exploration as well as numerous other industries, is the tally book, which is  an indispensable part of measurement accountability. It is an absolute requirement that should be convenient and accessible to all crew on a project. The tally book is the essential ledger and reference guide on the field for all calculations to be checked and consistently verified. Yet, due to the historical way of transcribing the measurements of using pen and paper, there are many unintended errors in calculating on measurements of depth, tubing, joints and the links recorded for the Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA). Today, however, there is a solution that will save work crews time, money and confusion. Introducing the Tally Book app.\n\nCreated by, John Ortegon, a Tool Service Hand with nearly 20 years experience, the Tally Book is an easy to use a downloadable app for any workman in the service, drilling or production sectors regardless of oil well size and depth. The Tally Book app is managed by a designated administrator with the company in charge of the project.\n\n\nThe administrator will share the password with the crew of that particular shift and all real time measurements and information is immediately available with on point clarity and accuracy. All tallies are permanently recorded and saved for future reference and usage. Additionally, the Tally Book app is transcribed and translated in both English and Spanish which will help in overcoming any language barriers while also creating a safer, more trusting and harmonious workplace.\n\nIn the words of of the Tally Book app developer, Mr. Ortegon, “I created Tally Book to save time, money and errors on the fly while establishing better accuracy for myself and the professionals in my industry.” For more information, download the Tally Book app today on IPhone.

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

The date and start odometer are entered automatically.\n \nThere are no pretty graphs, fancy reports or a multitude of settings, just simple, quick entries.\n \nAll entries can be exported to a CSV file for manipulation (graphs and wiz-bang formulas) in a spreadsheet.\n\nFeatures details:\n- Add entries for each trip including distance, places, reasons and general notes.\n- 1 to 3 taps for a new entry\n- Include start and end times, if required\n- Export to CSV\n- PDF by month, last month, last 3 months, last year, or all\n- Email CSV and PDF\n- Popup monthly summaries"

Click here for details: http://bit.ly/1yTq539.\n\nThis app allows you to perform detailed block and room-by-room heating and cooling loads for residential buildings out in the field, by taking advantage of the simplicity and power of the iPhone.\n\nThis app was designed by Carmel Software Corporation, a 25-year old software design firm specializing in engineering analysis software applications. We are not just 1 person designing mobile apps out of a bedroom. We are a team of software developers and engineers with over 50 years combined software and engineering design experience. In fact, our software powers the analysis capabilities of major Autodesk (The makers of AutoCAD) software tools such as Autodesk Revit. \n\nThe following is just a small sample of the features included in this app:\n\n1. Calculations based upon abridged ACCA Manual J8 calculations (This is not an ACCA-approved app. For our ACCA-approved iPad app, search for the HVAC ResLoad-J app on the app store)\n\n2. Includes a 1000+ world-wide city weather database\n\n3. Includes data for 100s of construction types for walls, roofs, floors, doors, windows, skylights, ceilings, and more\n\n4. Allows you to create and store an unlimited number of projects\n\n5. Allows you to create an unlimited number of rooms and view individual loads and airflows for those rooms\n\n6. Allows you to specify an unlimited # of opaque types (ie – doors, walls, roofs, floors, ceilings), window types, and skylight types for each building\n\n7. Allows you to instantly view total heating and cooling load results as you update input data\n\n8. Allows you to view comprehensive cooling and heating load breakdown reports including breakdown by opaque load, window load, skylight load, infiltration load, ventilation load and internal load contributions\n\n9. Opaque inputs include opaque type, opaque construction number, dimensions, and opening areas\n\n10. Window inputs include window type, internal and external shading type, overhang dimensions, window area, and more..\n\n11. Additional input types include # of people, # of bedrooms, ventilation airflow, and more..\n\n12. Includes ability to display a wide variety of on-screen reports including checksum reports (ie – BTUh/SqFt, SqFt/Ton, etc.), complete heating and cooling load breakdown reports, and even graphically-pleasing pie charts showing cooling and heating load breakdowns\n\n13. Includes the ability to display a comprehensive HTML report that you can email to yourself or others, and it also includes a spreadsheet attachment that you can open in Excel to further massage data on your desktop\n\n14. Includes English (IP) or Metric (SI) units\n\n15. This is the same technology that powers the Trane MAP iPad app that they offer to their elite dealer network\n\nThe benefits of using this app are numerous including:\n\n1. Great for use out in the field. Quickly size heating and cooling equipment, show the client, then email the results back to your office for further analysis.\n\n2. Show off your advanced on-screen reports to clients convincing them you are using cutting-edge technology\n\n3. Save time by inputting information in the field and then returning to your office to perform more in-depth analysis"

Check out our other apps to find it.\n\nKiosker is the most straightforward way to transform any iOS device into a full screen web kiosk. Built on the same web engine that Safari uses, Kiosker can be used to display websites, PDFs, images, videos, and documents. Use Kiosker to attract your customers with a digital newsletter signup kiosk or an interactive product guide. Do you own a smart home hub with a web control panel? Then Kiosker is your top choice for setting up an on-wall control center. Kiosker can even help you to test your students’ knowledge by giving them secure digital exams. We are sure that Kiosker can be used in many more ways than we ever can think of, and we are really curious to see what you can make out of our application.\n\nAll of the functionality you expect from a modern browser is built right into the app. This includes user-friendly settings management, a togglable clean navigation bar with Google-search built-in, a menu overlay for easy access to the main functions, and more. We also include several ways to handle the notch on newer iPhones, which could otherwise be annoying when viewing fullscreen content on those devices.\n\nControl the user experience by\n• Adding a start URL as the starting point of the kiosk. This could be a place on the internet or a local resource.\n• Defining favorites for easy navigation to the most used websites.\n• Limiting the accessible domains.\n• Hiding or showing the navigation and status bars.\n• Locking the device to a specified orientation.\n• Displaying an on-screen menu that lets you navigate and control Kiosker. \n• Restricting the user from interacting with the page in various ways, including scrolling, zooming, selecting, etc.\n• Setting time limits for automatic reload, browsing time, and return to home when idle.\n• Showing a screensaver at a configured time, when the kiosk is unused or when dark mode is enabled.\n• Set up the screensaver as a slideshow.\n• Exiting the screensaver with motion detection (requires iOS 13 or later) or with a tap.\n• Extending the experience by paring a physical flic Bluetooth button.\n• Interacting with Kiosker using JavaScript.\n• Sharing your configuration with other devices.\n• Locking the device to Kiosker using guided access, single app mode, or autonomous single app mode.\n\nVisit our website for a full feature list.\n\nKiosker requires iOS 11 or later.\n\nDon't hesitate to contact us if you have come up with a feature that we haven't thought of or if you have found a bug."

There is no centralized (shared) storage space on your device. This means that this app's proprietary printing engine only works within this app. The iOS cannot use this app to print files within another app's storage space—for example, files stored in Pages, Numbers, Safari, Notes, Mail, etc. Therefore, files created in other apps must be imported into this app.)\n\n\nHOW DO I IMPORT FILES INTO THIS APP?\n• Use a web browser to transfer files between your computer and this app.\n• Use iTunes to upload files into this app.\n• Use a WebDAV server to transfer files.\n• Email a file to yourself. Then, open the Mail app, press and hold down the attachment until the \"Open In...\" menu appears. Select this app from the list of apps displayed.\n\n\nIS THERE HELP AVAILABLE?\nYes. In addition to the built-in user guide, you can also ask questions via our real-time chat Customer Support module.\n\n\n\n[1] Each fax unit purchases a one-page fax that can be sent in 60 seconds or less to a destination in the United States or Canada. The number of fax units needed to transmit a one-page 60-second fax to a destination in another country is listed in the rate card within this app. Please note that a page that requires a longer transmission time (for example, a page containing high resolution graphics) consumes additional fax units.\n[2] To receive voicemail or faxes, you must setup an incoming toll-free phone number. The toll-free phone number requires a monthly subscription. 60 minutes/month are included free with subscription. Toll-free numbers are USA-based numbers and are accessible in the United States only.\nOptional Toll Free Number Subscription Notes: \n• Title: Toll-Free Number Subscription\n• Length: 1,3, 6 or 12 month options \n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at purchase confirmation\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n• No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active period \n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase\n• Privacy Policy: https://www.ndilitechnologies.com/privacy.html\n• Terms of use: https://www.ndilitechnologies.com/termsofuse.html"

      "label": "Warm up your cold calls with SwiftCall. Swiftly auto dial through intelligently sorted call lists, review detailed analytics of call sessions, and swiftly take follow-up actions without ever leaving the app. Make phone calls without having to dial a number into a keypad. SwiftCall is the way call time was meant to be.\n\nCollaboration is key, and SwiftCall makes it easy to make sales calls as a team with lead sharing and analytics reporting. Stop maintaining that disorganized spreadsheet or scanning your eyes between a notepad and a phone. If you've been calling over 25, 50, or even 100 leads per day, get ready for SwiftCall to completely transform your sales process.\n\nCall Lists:\nManage the lead pipeline intelligently from first contact through close. Create leads or import a CSV with thousands of them and then SwiftCall will do the work of sorting them into call lists. SwiftCall tracks progress with each lead as you call to determine which ones are more promising. \n\nNo need to restart data entry for leads: import a CSV with hundreds or even thousands of leads within seconds. Share leads easily between SwiftCallers to work together as a team.\n\nAnalytics & Achievements:\nIf you can't measure, you can't manage. That's why SwiftCall keeps track of progress from the analytics Dashboard. View charts with calls, deals, and revenue per day. It’s like a fitness tracker for business growth. Review call logs and achievements earned to measure long-term performance. Create reports from the Dashboard to show off your performance to the team.\n\nFollow-Up Actions:\nCall time doesn’t just stop with the call. You want to stay fresh in the mind of your lead so they know that their time is valued. That’s why SwiftCall can quickly send follow-up emails or text messages as a follow-up. The Planner then helps schedule the next call and creates notifications for when the time comes to call again. If you have it enabled, Siri Suggestions will also prompt you right before your scheduled call, allowing you to tap the notification to dial in.\n\nMaybe you are hustling to build your business, or perhaps you work on a sales team with big dreams. Maybe you are a fundraiser at a non profit. Regardless of where you come from, we are here to help. Our reviewers brag about receiving service within seconds, and you won’t find a better deal for your sales budget: everything is included upon download, with no subscriptions or in-app purchases. Plus you get an Apple Watch app for when you want to use SwiftCall on the go. Set your goal, start calling, and start closing more deals!\n\nIncluded Features \n•Create leads and SwiftCall will intelligently sort them so deals can be closed more quickly and less time is wasted on the bad leads\n•Collaborate with a sales team with CSV importing & exporting for leads\n•See reports and call logs detailing daily progress on calls made, deals closed, and revenue earned\n•Share reports of call logs and analytics\n•Set goals for call lists to stay on track\n•Finish a call and quickly send an email or text message to stay fresh in the mind of the lead\n•Schedule future calls to create Calendar events and receive Siri Suggestions, in addition to receiving push notifications for your device and Apple Watch\n•Review leads and make calls from SwiftCall’s Apple Watch app \n\nPotential Uses \n•Jumpstart the growth of a startup to build the next big thing\n•Set a goal of making 50 calls in a day, and then actually do it with the app offering motivation from beginning to end \n•Grow the effectiveness of a sales team and work together using lead sharing and analytics reports\n•Streamline fundraising calls for a political campaign to spend less time on the phones and more time doing important work\n•Make a non-profit a lean mean fundraising machine (and clean up all the stray sticky notes and spreadsheet docs along the way)\n•Give employees incentives and rewards by creating a weekly competition to see who makes the most calls or close the most deals on SwiftCall"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Why should you join the countless Airmen who have already been promoted using this app? Read on...\n\n1. PURCHASE ONCE, USE FOR A CAREER! PDG PROmote provides lifetime free updates. Why should you have to pay for a new app every time the study guides are updated? You don’t pay $0.99 for these apps. You deserve lifetime updates. We know that your promotion is important to you but that doesn’t give us the right to take advantage of it. Should the Air Force resume testing for the SNCO ranks in the future, rest assured that we will include those ranks in the app too.\n\n2. EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN ONE APP! This app contains everything you need to prepare for your WAPS testing. We're serious. You never need to leave the app.\n\n3. ADAPTABLE TO EVERY LEARNING STYLE.  Not everyone studies the same way.  PDG PROmote provides all of the options you need to study in a manner that works best for you.  Want to read the AFH 1 paragraphs?  You can.  Want to read condensed nuggets of information from AFH 1?  You can.  Want to study flashcard questions?  You can.  Want to study flashcard questions but with the answers always shown?  You can.  Want to listen to the slides, flashcards, or AFH 1 paragraphs on your way to work?  You can.  Want to listen and read at the same time?  You can.  Your mission is to master all the testable sections of AFH 1 and no other app offers you as many ways to do that.\n\n4. JUST SIT BACK AND LISTEN. We made our audio even better. Sit back and listen to study slides, questions, and even AFH 1 paragraphs. Sure, it's synthetic audio but it’s a popular feature that many of our users use on their drive to and from work.\n\n5. OUR SMART TESTS WILL SET YOU UP FOR SUCCESS. PDG PROmote knows which questions you have seen, answered correctly, gotten wrong, how many times you answered correctly, how many times you answered incorrectly, even how many consecutive times you answered a question correctly. It uses this information to always put the right questions in front of you on tests.\n\n6. OPTIMIZE YOUR LIMITED STUDY TIME. You have a full-time job. We know you need to get the most out of your limited study opportunities. PDG PROmote makes it easy for you to maximize the effectiveness of your study sessions.\n\n7. INTUITIVE DESIGN. PDG PROmote is simply the most intuitive and least frustrating AFH 1 study guide you will find. Experience the difference a great designed app can make.\n\n8. OUR QUESTIONS ARE SIMPLY BETTER. Many of our users have commented to us that our questions aren't as simplistic as other apps. They make you think a little more. The actual exam seemed easier. PDG PROmote provides TOTAL COVERAGE of the AFH 1 based study guides.\n\n9. DON’T BE TRICKED INTO PAYING SKY HIGH PRICES! You will be accused of selling yourself short. Don’t believe it. You will be asked to pay a small fortune for their \"experience\". Just remind yourself that you are being tested on a handbook (AFH 1) dated 1 November 2021, not 1987. You can easily find Airmen who have used our app and scored high. THEY ARE EVERYWHERE. Our users pay about half as much, get the same or better results, and get free lifetime updates. Doesn't that sound wise to you?\n\nON MAC AND PC! Go to http://forcereadiness.com/pdg-promote-pdg-study-guide to learn more.\n\nPDG PROmote is an application aimed to prepare Airmen who are taking the Air Force Promotion Fitness Examination (PFE) or the USAFSE-United States Air Force supervisory examination. Its sole source of reference is The Study Guide for Promotion to (SSgt, TSgt), 1 November 2021. All study guides are sourced from Air Force Handbook 1 (AFH 1) dated 1 November 2021. Just select the appropriate study guide for the promotion grade that you are testing to and begin studying!"

If you want to start over, just keep spinning and enter the combination again.\n\nHELPFUL HINTS\nIf you make a common mistake when opening the lock—like forgetting to spin one rotation to the left before your second number—you’ll be notified with a friendly hint.\n\nWALKTHROUGH MODE\nIf you get stuck, don't worry. Enable Walkthrough Mode to get step-by-step instructions as you open the lock.\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOCK\nChoose from six different dial colors: red, yellow, green, blue, purple, or black.\n\nGENERATE A RANDOM COMBINATION, OR CHOOSE YOUR OWN\nIf you want to test yourself, generate a combination randomly. Or, choose your own in one of two number ranges: 0-39 or 0-49."

Test material is expertly organized into categories based on subject matter and includes, questions, answers, correct answers, and detailed explanations. \n\n• STUDY QUESTIONS BY TOPIC • \n\nLearning Mode allows you to create custom review sessions by selecting exactly which categories you want to review. Each session randomly generates the question order, and provides instant feedback based on your answer selection. Each question also provides a detailed description as to why each answer is right or wrong. These explanations were developed by Sporty’s team of Master CFI’s, based on their experience preparing students for the Private Pilot certificate\n\n• REVIEW QUESTION FLASHCARDS •\n\nFlashcard mode tests your knowledge by allowing you to only see the question without the answer choices. After answering the question mentally, you can then select to show the correct answer, and self-grade your progress along the way. This is a great feature that keeps you from being distracted by incorrect answers!\n\n• TAKE PRACTICE TESTS •\n\nTest mode randomly generates a 60-question session from the entire database of published FAA test questions, simulating the real Private Pilot test. After answering all the questions, you’ll be given instant results, and have the option to review either all the questions, or just missed questions. Included in the review session are the same detailed explanations for why each answer is right or wrong.\n\n•PROGRESS REPORTS•\n\nAfter completing each test your results are saved in the app's Progress Report section, where you can review previous scores and and a detailed history of each question and answer selection. You can also pause a partially-completed session, and resume it at a later time here."

      "label": "BEFORE YOU BUY ANOTHER BOARD STUDY APP ASK YOURSELF:\n\n1. Does it offer over 3,400 questions?  Our app contains thousands more than some other apps.  You don't have to study all 3,400+ questions but they are there for you if you want.  \n2. CAN YOU GRADE YOURSELF?  Seriously!  Many board apps don't even allow you to grade yourself.  You can't look at your test scores for each subject because they don't even keep score.\n3. Does it have an advanced learn engine that tracks questions seen/unseen, answered correctly/incorrectly, and then dynamically creates your tests accordingly?\n4. Does it provide BOTH a casual study mode AND a test mode?\n5. Does it provide AUDIO questions?\n6. Are you able to SEE your study and test PROGRESS for ALL lessons at a MERE GLANCE?\n8. Can you customize your tests with adjustable question counts and subjects?\n9. Does it allow you to add your own unit study documents and files to the app?  Most units have unique study requirements such as unit history.  This app allows you to easily add those documents directly into the app.\n\nThis is a comprehensive guide addressing the common Army promotion board topics - over 40 subjects. Information was taken directly from Army regulations, Army doctrine reference publications (ADRPs), Army doctrine publications (ADPs), field manuals, technical manuals, training circulars, and pamphlets. All the study material is in question/ answer/ flashcard format. Hyperlinks are used in the larger sections to help better facilitate the blocks of information. In addition, to help support some of the question/answers, notes are provided throughout along with Helpful Hints to aid in memory recall. \n\nForceReadiness.com is not affiliated with the US Army. We simply support soldiers every way we can."

Use this app to study for your US Amateur Radio License -- our question pools are always up to date and always have the current question pools because the app can download updates from the website whenever you are connected to the internet.\n\nDesigned and written by hams with volunteer examiner experience and Sponsored by Icom, this is not your typical study app -- most study apps will focus on practice exams, which is somewhat like studying for your math test by throwing darts at your textbook. Though HamStudy is not a full instructional tool our app is focussed on providing you with the tools you need to study the parts of the question pool that you most need to see.\n\nOur intelligent Study Mode tracks your progress as you move through the pool, providing you with full statistics on what you've seen and giving you the visibility into where you need to study. It will automatically repeat questions as needed. When you don't understand something you can tap the \"explain\" button to view an explanation of the question. Practice Exams make it easy to see how close you are to passing and see what areas to focus on in Study Mode.\n\nShare your progress with your friends or instructor and study together!\n\n* Study *all* current US Amateur Radio question pools (Technician, General, Amateur Extra) -- updates can be downloaded for free when they become available. Additional pools, such as the FCC commercial pools and the Canadian pools, are also available for download in the app. \n\n* This app is not a study guide, it is a directed study tool centered around the questions; there are explanations contributed by users for most pools which do help in learning, but some users may want to pair the app with a study manual to get the most out of both.\n\n* HamStudy's revolutionary Study Modes work with you to ensure you learn the questions; they automatically track your progress and adjust the pace to keep you challenged but not frustrated. User-submitted explanations help you avoid the pitfall of just memorizing answers. Synchronize with your online HamStudy.org account to prevent data loss and be able to switch devices easily.\n\n* Share your progress with other HamStudy.org users and help each other keep progressing towards that next license exam!"

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers.

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "AndyRDH Board Review for NBDHE (Hygiene), NBDE (Dental), and DANB (Assisting) exams.\n\nWith this app, you will rock on the Board exam! \n\nThis app is completely interactive!  \n\nNearly 1000 questions to test your knowledge on common Board items and words!\n\nNo more carrying around heavy textbooks and needing internet access to take practice exams.  No page flipping to check your answers and no manually calculating your grade.  \n\nWe do all the work for you and make it fun!\n\nAndy Codding, RDH – better known as “AndyRDH” or “AndyFutureRDH” has been the nationwide leader and resource for helping students prepare for, take, and kick butt on the dental hygiene Board exam.  This app will also help you prepare for the NBDE (Dental) exam as the question banks are the same.  If you are preparing for the DANB exam, this will also help!\n\nTopics covered include:\nClinic & Ethics \nCommunity \nDental Anatomy \nDental Materials \nMicrobiology \nNutrition\nOral Pathology\nPeriodontology \nPharmacology \nRadiology \nSpecial Needs\n\nUse this app while waiting in line at the drive-thru, grocery store, waiting for lecture to start, or your clinic patient to come.  No longer will you be worried about the times you should have been studying, if only you had your textbooks.  \n\nThis app rocks!\n\nFeatures:\n\nNearly 1000 total questions with ability to upgrade for additional questions.\n\nCountdown timer!  Set you Board test date and graduation date and always see how many seconds are remaining!  You’re closer than you think!  Are you ready!?\nFour mock Board exams with 150 questions each.  Rationales included for most questions!  Ability to upgrade to more mock Boards.\n\nMock Boards have memory! They automatically shuffle the order of questions each time you take them.  This means you will see a different test each time you attempt it.\n\nExclusive “Understood” option lets you mark a question as “understood” so that you no longer see that question again. We have an option in the settings menu to uncheck all understood questions if you want to see them again later.\nMarking questions as understood, means each time you take the test, you only focus on ones that you don’t understand yet.  Mark each one understood until you know and comprehend the questions and answers for all the questions!  This insures you “know” before you “go” take the real Board exam.\n\nQuestions by topic.  Do you only want to take questions on just Dental Materials or Dental Anatomy?  This option allows you to focus only on one topic.  Eleven main topics are covered.\n\nPrefixes and suffixes section - This area has nearly 300 questions testing your knowledge of the most important area you can study for the Board exam.  If you know the prefixes and suffixes, you can better answer test items and deduce the meaning of words you are unfamiliar with.\n\n90% of vocabulary on boards can be determined simply by knowing common prefixes and suffixes!  This app makes sure you are on your “A-Game” when tackling the Board exam!\n\nExclusive feature of converting your score percentage of correct answers to what it would be on the real Board exam!  This is based off last year’s five test versions and will convert your percentage to what you would have made on the real test with your results.  This is a must for gauging your studying and is only available based on Andy’s extensive research of multiple scoresheets.\n\nThese Mock Board questions are exclusive to the AndyRDH app and can not be found on the  HYPERLINK \"http://www.AndyFutureRDH.com\" www.AndyFutureRDH.com websitem or any other location!!\n\nRationales for most questions are available.  To find out rationales for incorrect answers, you must select them."

      "label": "English grammar game app / Available on the iPhone and iPad\n\nSenGram is an iPhone and iPad language game which presents pre-prepared sentence diagram puzzles and solutions to those puzzles, for players to solve.\n\n(Please note: this is an educational sentence-diagramming puzzle game, it is NOT a tool which will solve your homework for you...). \n\nThis puzzle game tests and improves your ability to take sentences apart, identify the underlying grammatical structure, and reflect that structure on a diagram. \n\nThis game will be of interest to students of language (including ESL students), lovers of language and grammar, those sitting standardised tests with a grammar component (e.g. SAT, GMAT, NAPLAN) as well as those who are familiar with sentence diagrams and enjoy completing them as puzzles. The game might be especially useful to those students who are are currently studying a course in which sentence diagramming is used as a teaching tool.\n\n---------------------------\n\nSome reviews (US region):\n\nGreat App\nby Beezer88 - Version 1.00 - Aug 11, 2012. This is great for teaching how to diagram a sentence. Keep developing!!! :)\n\nSpectacular!\nby Viskid - Version 1.00 - Aug 11, 2012\nThis application has been used to great effect in my classroom. Used as part of the daily warmup, my kids are becoming so efficient at this oft forgotten skill. 5 stars and a hip-hip-hooray for this app.\n\nWorthwhile\nby GhostGame123 - Version 1.00 - Aug 9, 2012. I teach Latin and a major difficulty is getting the students to see the structure of sentences. The problem, at least in part, is that they don't (or can't) see structure even in English--no one teaches diagramming any more. I'm going to try to incorporate this into this year's classes. Thanks; I'd certainly buy more elaborate versions or buy upgrades in app.\n\nLove it!\nby Louwege - Version 1.00 - Jul 19, 2012\nPlease continue to develop. Great aid to learning. Thank you.\n\n--------------------\n\nYour objective when playing the game will be to place each word in the 'puzzle sentence' in its correct place on the 'sentence diagram'.\n         \nAt present the app includes over 100 sentence puzzles, including:\n\n(1) Subject and verb: 20 sentences.\n(2) Article, adjective, adverb, possessive: 21 sentences.\n(3) Prepositional phrase, adverbial noun: 20 sentences.\n(4) Object - direct, indirect: 20 sentences.\n(5) Linking verb: 20 sentences.\n(6) Co-ordinating conjunction: 12 sentences.\n(7) Challenge puzzles: 10 sentences.\n\nIn addition, there are further puzzles for purchase within the app in the 'SenGram Store'.\n\nThe style of diagram adopted in this app is known as the 'Reed Kellogg' style, and there are many websites and books devoted to it. In our view this style of diagramming offers one of the more enjoyable ways to test and improve your knowledge of grammar, especially if you have a visual mind.\n\nBest of luck! We hope you enjoy the puzzles!"

      "label": "Flashnote Derby is a fun way for kids to learn and practice reading music notes. \n\nEach race is a timed test in which the student identifies different notes in order to urge their horse on towards the finish line. Answering quickly and correctly will cause their horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause it to fall behind. At the end of each race, students can review the notes they missed and see the correct answers. \n\nPlayers can respond to flashcards by simply playing the note on their acoustic or MIDI instrument. They can also choose to answer by tapping letter buttons or playing a key on an on-screen piano.\n\nThe game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs to be included. You can select ranges of notes, or several individual notes to focus on specific areas that need work. Notes can be shown with sharps and flats and key signatures can even be added to increase the challenge for more advanced students. The amount of time the player is given for each flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and level of experience.\n\nDrills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five and a half ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to shoot for.\n\nAs a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.\n\nBecause it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson. Teachers have the ability to email homework assignments to their students for them to play on their own devices at home. Each player's performance is recorded so that their progress can be tracked. You can easily see which notes are most in need of review.  \n\nWhen students give up on their music lessons, it's usually because they find it too difficult. Learning basic skills early is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby makes this process more enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music learning.\n\nSometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Download Flashnote Derby and get on the road to music reading mastery today!"

      "label": "\"A great way to give parents a break and let your kid have fun and learn to read at the same time.\" - Jen, Kindergarten teacher and mom of three.\r\n\r\nI have a confession to make.  My son's favorite game was Fruit Ninja and I was getting increasingly frustrated with having my son waste a lot of time on a fun but mindless game while he was still struggling to master his sight words and learning to read. \r\n\r\nSo I decided to create our very own Sight Words slicing game and to my and my son's delight, he now has a new favorite game where he is having fun and learning at the same time. \r\n\r\nMy sons skills in recognizing Sight Words have dramatically improved since he started playing this game and now I no longer have to feel guilty when I need a five minute break to take care of the laundry or prepare lunch for the kids.  I know that they are having fun and that they are learning at the same time.\r\n\r\nWarning: Your child will keep begging for your iPhone or iPad after they try this app.\r\n\r\nSight Words Ninja is an exciting educational game that helps kids rapidly learn sight words by sight, sound, and touch.  \r\n\r\nThe interface is so easy to use that even a 9 month old baby will delight in using this app. \r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n• Slice your way through all sights words from preschool to grade 3\r\n\r\n• You decide what to focus on - turn individual categories ON or OFF from the settings page\r\n\r\n• Learn by sight, sound, and touch\r\n\r\n• Fun game play, sounds, and animations keep kids engaged\r\n\r\n• Dynamic game play adjusts difficulty (the number of sight words) automatically based on player skills to keep kids both challenged and entertained vs. getting bored\r\n\r\n• Supports 3 difficulty settings: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD\r\n\r\nEASY MODE:\r\n- Max 1 sight word\r\n- Sight words move very slowly\r\n- Great for introducing sight words one at a time\r\n\r\nMEDIUM MODE:\r\n- Starts with 1 sight word\r\n- Max of 3 sight words on screen\r\n- Sight words move 30% faster\r\n\r\nHARD MODE:\r\n- Starts with 2 sight words\r\n- Max of 5 sight words on screen\r\n- Sight words move even faster\r\n- Sight words rotate faster too\r\n\r\nAdjust difficulty from settings page. \r\n \r\n• Wrong answers do not interfere with gameplay, the child can immediately try again and slice the correct answer (most other games are too slow to keep kids interested by interrupting the gameplay and slowly repeating the desired question)\r\n\r\n• Play Sight Words from A to Z or in random order (adjustable from settings page)\r\n\r\n• Multi-sensory learning tool - combining audio, voice, and touch\r\n\r\n• Want to work on just a few Sight Words?  No problem… head to the settings page to turn entire categories or individual Sight Words on and off\r\n\r\n• Want to record your own audios? No problem.  Just click on the category and record your own Sight Words sounds \r\n\r\n• Supports three levels of difficulty \r\n\r\nHEROIC SUPPORT\r\n\r\nHeroic Support is not just what we do.  It's really what makes us, well, us.  It's that drive to make a difference in your life - no matter how big or small.

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Say the word in the conjugated form indicated.\n(2) Tap the sound icon to check whether you said the conjugated form correctly.\n(3) Tap the ＊ icon to check the conjugated form in writing.\n(4) Study the use of the conjugated form by referring to the example sentence and illustration on the back side of the card.\n(5) Tap the Rule icon to see the conjugation rule.\n\nCheck: Test your retention of each conjugated form by typing in your answers.*\n(1) Type in the conjugated form as instructed.\n(2) If you entered the correct form, the card will be removed from MyDeck. Cards answered incorrectly or skipped will remain in the deck for further practice.\n*To study with the Check method, you will need to add a Japanese keyboard to your iPhone settings before starting.\n\nHandy features\n•Menu\nThe study selections are grouped together in a single menu to allow you to practice more efficiently. \n\n•List\nAll conjugation forms of each word are listed in this feature, with the words arranged in a-i-u-e-o order. A check mark is displayed next to each conjugation form that has been mastered and the MyDeck card for each entry can be opened, allowing you to review the conjugations via the list.\n\n•Rule\nThis feature lists the rules for all 28 conjugation types covered by the app, enabling you to quickly look up the way to form conjugations such as the passive, the causative, the causative passive, and the tricky te-form.\n\n•MyDeck Shuffle Mode\nActivating this mode will cause the app to display the MyDeck cards in random order, rather than the default order. Shuffling the deck will help you to more firmly master the material.\n\n•Tutorials\nThe tutorials provide helpful lessons on how to add a Japanese keyboard and operate each function. \n\n—This app is based on the second edition of GENKI.\n—Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

      "label": "Welcome to The Spalding Method ™ Phonograms app!\nNOTICE: Upon installing this mobile application, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions.\nThis Spalding Phonograms app is designed for helping students learn the phonics connection between speech sounds and written symbols that represent those sounds (phonograms). Learning the phonograms is essential for accurate and automatic reading, writing, and spelling. Teaching all the sounds of the phonemes represented by an alphabet letter or combination of two, three, or four letters (phonograms) enables students to read, spell, and write high-frequency words quickly. Students who learn the phonograms well expand their vocabulary and are able to use effective and creative communication skills in writing. Critical thinking is involved in learning the appropriate phonogram placement within words for accurate spelling and for applying information learned during phonogram reviews to pronounce unfamiliar words. \nThe Spalding Phonograms app is for students that need additional practice, including home schooling, ESL (English as a Second Language), ELL (English Language Learners), ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) students, and those with dyslexia or other learning disabilities. The school and home connection is encouraged through collaboration and communication with the teacher, parent, and student for practicing the phonograms appropriately and adequately. The Spalding  Phonograms app aligns with the core reading foundational skills required by state and national standards that are most crucial to the development of early reading success and reading comprehension, including:\n•\tPhonemic awareness\n•\tFeature recognition\n•\tLetter recognition\n•\tSound-symbol relationships (decoding)\nThe Spalding Phonograms app provides the following options for all 87 phonograms.\n•\tPhonogram Introduction by selected group – The student sees the phonograms in order of instruction in The Writing Road to Reading, listens to the teacher say the sound(s), and then says the sound(s).\n•\tOral Phonogram Review – A random phonogram card is show, followed by a pause. The student says the sound(s) and then listens to check accuracy. \n•\tWritten Phonogram Review –The student hears the phonogram sounds, followed by a pause; the student repeats the sound(s), listens for a cue, if needed, and then writes the phonogram on lined paper. The card is immediately shown so the student can check for accuracy.\n•\tDifferentiated Practice – Specific phonograms (from all 87) can be selected that need more practice. These phonograms can then be practiced in Phonogram Introduction, Oral Phonogram Review, or Written Phonogram Review."

      "label": "Team Shake provides a technological and environmentally friendly way to choose teams for board games, sporting events, tournaments, school projects or anytime groups are required. The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. \n\nTeam Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  \n\nThe app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.\n\nIf you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Create 1 to 64 random teams\n* Create completely random or balanced teams\n* Full iPad support\n* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams\n* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook\n* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.\n* Save lists of friends for later games\n* Import lists from email or spreadsheet\n* Export lists and options for use on another device\n* Satisfying feeling of shaking a “virtual” hat to create teams\n* Animated shaking hat\n* Entry of names via onscreen keyboard\n* Entry of names via iPhone contacts\n* Temporarily disable people who are absent\n* Set groups of people to always be on the same team\n* Set groups of people to always be on different teams\n* Set user strength to make more even teams (now supports fully balanced teams)\n* 5 users strengths level\n* Pick a single random person from the list of players\n* User strength indicator on the main screen (can be disabled in options)\n* Number of active players and total players is now displayed on the main screen\n* Video Out Support\n* Option to Sort Teams by Name\n* Option to balance male / female team members\n* \"Equal Ability\" option to create teams where all players have the same strength\n* Option to create separate male and female teams\n* Configurable Team Colors\n* Configurable Team Names\n* Print Support\n* Export Teams in CSV or XLS Format\n* Team Shake now supports simultaneously assigning players to multiple subteams and / or oppose teams at the same time.\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now have customized names to make selection easier\n* Subteams / Oppose teams can now be enabled or disabled globally so that teams can be made quickly without subteams / oppose teams.  In particular, Balance Teams Strengths will work when separate Male / Female teams are created.\n\nYappler-Tags: Teams, Groups, Random, Hat, Entertainment, Games, Utilities"

Flashcard Hero keeps track of what facts you already know so you can focus on what you don’t know and save a lot of time. \n\nWe made Flashcard Hero for those of you who want to fit more than a few words on each card. You can add images, lists, and use text formatting to structure your content.\n\n- Write cards on your iPhone/iPad\n\n- Add images\n\n- Group cards into topics\n\n- Text formatting & lists\n\n- Find and study only difficult cards\n\n- iCloud Drive support (syncs with the Mac app, which is a separate purchase)\n\n\nStudy Options:\n\n- Memorizing cards by covering the answer\n\n- Multiple Choice tests with randomly picked or predefined answers\n\n- Supports studying with the Spaced Repetition System (Leitner Box System)\n\n\nFor Teachers and Educators:\n\n- Compatible with the Remote Control feature of the Mac app. You can use the iOS app as a remote to control the study mode on the Mac while you are projecting on a big screen.\n\n\n\nPeople use the Flashcard Hero Mac & iOS apps to study many different subjects. Here’s a short list of the most popular subjects based on the over 2 million cards that users have shared among each other so far:\n\n- Medicine (anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, genetics)\n- Psychology\n- Law & business administration (economics, marketing, international law)\n- History and politics\n- Languages (Latin, Chinese, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German)\n- Social sciences\n- Music and music theory\n- Space physiology (how cool is that?)\n- Many more…\n\nYou see a lot of subjects in the top ranks where people have to memorize a lot of “structured” information. That’s because Flashcard Hero is designed specifically to go beyond language learning, offering more room on each card for facts, lists, and images. You can also organize cards into topics (to match chapters of a text book, for example).\n\nNote: This app is a single, one-time purchase. No subscriptions, no in-app purchases, no ads. The App Store might list the app as having in-app purchases, but those are only for backwards compatibility with an earlier version of the app. With this download, you get all features right away."

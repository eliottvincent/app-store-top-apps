      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "Why should you join the countless Airmen who have already been promoted using this app? Read on...\n\n1. PURCHASE ONCE, USE FOR A CAREER! PDG PROmote provides lifetime free updates. Why should you have to pay for a new app every time the study guides are updated? You don’t pay $0.99 for these apps. You deserve lifetime updates. We know that your promotion is important to you but that doesn’t give us the right to take advantage of it. Should the Air Force resume testing for the SNCO ranks in the future, rest assured that we will include those ranks in the app too.\n\n2. EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN ONE APP! This app contains everything you need to prepare for your WAPS testing. We're serious. You never need to leave the app.\n\n3. ADAPTABLE TO EVERY LEARNING STYLE.  Not everyone studies the same way.  PDG PROmote provides all of the options you need to study in a manner that works best for you.  Want to read the AFH 1 paragraphs?  You can.  Want to read condensed nuggets of information from AFH 1?  You can.  Want to study flashcard questions?  You can.  Want to study flashcard questions but with the answers always shown?  You can.  Want to listen to the slides, flashcards, or AFH 1 paragraphs on your way to work?  You can.  Want to listen and read at the same time?  You can.  Your mission is to master all the testable sections of AFH 1 and no other app offers you as many ways to do that.\n\n4. JUST SIT BACK AND LISTEN. We made our audio even better. Sit back and listen to study slides, questions, and even AFH 1 paragraphs. Sure, it's synthetic audio but it’s a popular feature that many of our users use on their drive to and from work.\n\n5. OUR SMART TESTS WILL SET YOU UP FOR SUCCESS. PDG PROmote knows which questions you have seen, answered correctly, gotten wrong, how many times you answered correctly, how many times you answered incorrectly, even how many consecutive times you answered a question correctly. It uses this information to always put the right questions in front of you on tests.\n\n6. OPTIMIZE YOUR LIMITED STUDY TIME. You have a full-time job. We know you need to get the most out of your limited study opportunities. PDG PROmote makes it easy for you to maximize the effectiveness of your study sessions.\n\n7. INTUITIVE DESIGN. PDG PROmote is simply the most intuitive and least frustrating AFH 1 study guide you will find. Experience the difference a great designed app can make.\n\n8. OUR QUESTIONS ARE SIMPLY BETTER. Many of our users have commented to us that our questions aren't as simplistic as other apps. They make you think a little more. The actual exam seemed easier. PDG PROmote provides TOTAL COVERAGE of the AFH 1 based study guides.\n\n9. DON’T BE TRICKED INTO PAYING SKY HIGH PRICES! You will be accused of selling yourself short. Don’t believe it. You will be asked to pay a small fortune for their \"experience\". Just remind yourself that you are being tested on a handbook (AFH 1) dated 1 November 2021, not 1987. You can easily find Airmen who have used our app and scored high. THEY ARE EVERYWHERE. Our users pay about half as much, get the same or better results, and get free lifetime updates. Doesn't that sound wise to you?\n\nON MAC AND PC! Go to http://forcereadiness.com/pdg-promote-pdg-study-guide to learn more.\n\nPDG PROmote is an application aimed to prepare Airmen who are taking the Air Force Promotion Fitness Examination (PFE) or the USAFSE-United States Air Force supervisory examination. Its sole source of reference is The Study Guide for Promotion to (SSgt, TSgt), 1 November 2021. All study guides are sourced from Air Force Handbook 1 (AFH 1) dated 1 November 2021. Just select the appropriate study guide for the promotion grade that you are testing to and begin studying!"

I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

Test material is expertly organized into categories based on subject matter and includes, questions, answers, correct answers, and detailed explanations. \n\n• STUDY QUESTIONS BY TOPIC • \n\nLearning Mode allows you to create custom review sessions by selecting exactly which categories you want to review. Each session randomly generates the question order, and provides instant feedback based on your answer selection. Each question also provides a detailed description as to why each answer is right or wrong. These explanations were developed by Sporty’s team of Master CFI’s, based on their experience preparing students for the Private Pilot certificate\n\n• REVIEW QUESTION FLASHCARDS •\n\nFlashcard mode tests your knowledge by allowing you to only see the question without the answer choices. After answering the question mentally, you can then select to show the correct answer, and self-grade your progress along the way. This is a great feature that keeps you from being distracted by incorrect answers!\n\n• TAKE PRACTICE TESTS •\n\nTest mode randomly generates a 60-question session from the entire database of published FAA test questions, simulating the real Private Pilot test. After answering all the questions, you’ll be given instant results, and have the option to review either all the questions, or just missed questions. Included in the review session are the same detailed explanations for why each answer is right or wrong.\n\n•PROGRESS REPORTS•\n\nAfter completing each test your results are saved in the app's Progress Report section, where you can review previous scores and and a detailed history of each question and answer selection. You can also pause a partially-completed session, and resume it at a later time here."

You don't have to study all 3,400+ questions but they are there for you if you want.  \n2. CAN YOU GRADE YOURSELF?  Seriously!  Many board apps don't even allow you to grade yourself.  You can't look at your test scores for each subject because they don't even keep score.\n3. Does it have an advanced learn engine that tracks questions seen/unseen, answered correctly/incorrectly, and then dynamically creates your tests accordingly?\n4. Does it provide BOTH a casual study mode AND a test mode?\n5. Does it provide AUDIO questions?\n6. Are you able to SEE your study and test PROGRESS for ALL lessons at a MERE GLANCE?\n8. Can you customize your tests with adjustable question counts and subjects?\n9. Does it allow you to add your own unit study documents and files to the app?  Most units have unique study requirements such as unit history.  This app allows you to easily add those documents directly into the app.\n\nThis is a comprehensive guide addressing the common Army promotion board topics - over 40 subjects. Information was taken directly from Army regulations, Army doctrine reference publications (ADRPs), Army doctrine publications (ADPs), field manuals, technical manuals, training circulars, and pamphlets. All the study material is in question/ answer/ flashcard format. Hyperlinks are used in the larger sections to help better facilitate the blocks of information. In addition, to help support some of the question/answers, notes are provided throughout along with Helpful Hints to aid in memory recall. \n\nForceReadiness.com is not affiliated with the US Army.

Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Use this app to study for your US Amateur Radio License -- our question pools are always up to date and always have the current question pools because the app can download updates from the website whenever you are connected to the internet.\n\nDesigned and written by hams with volunteer examiner experience and Sponsored by Icom, this is not your typical study app -- most study apps will focus on practice exams, which is somewhat like studying for your math test by throwing darts at your textbook. Though HamStudy is not a full instructional tool our app is focussed on providing you with the tools you need to study the parts of the question pool that you most need to see.\n\nOur intelligent Study Mode tracks your progress as you move through the pool, providing you with full statistics on what you've seen and giving you the visibility into where you need to study. It will automatically repeat questions as needed. When you don't understand something you can tap the \"explain\" button to view an explanation of the question. Practice Exams make it easy to see how close you are to passing and see what areas to focus on in Study Mode.\n\nShare your progress with your friends or instructor and study together!\n\n* Study *all* current US Amateur Radio question pools (Technician, General, Amateur Extra) -- updates can be downloaded for free when they become available. Additional pools, such as the FCC commercial pools and the Canadian pools, are also available for download in the app. \n\n* This app is not a study guide, it is a directed study tool centered around the questions; there are explanations contributed by users for most pools which do help in learning, but some users may want to pair the app with a study manual to get the most out of both.\n\n* HamStudy's revolutionary Study Modes work with you to ensure you learn the questions; they automatically track your progress and adjust the pace to keep you challenged but not frustrated. User-submitted explanations help you avoid the pitfall of just memorizing answers. Synchronize with your online HamStudy.org account to prevent data loss and be able to switch devices easily.\n\n* Share your progress with other HamStudy.org users and help each other keep progressing towards that next license exam!"

      "label": "\"A great way to give parents a break and let your kid have fun and learn to read at the same time.\" - Jen, Kindergarten teacher and mom of three.\r\n\r\nI have a confession to make.  My son's favorite game was Fruit Ninja and I was getting increasingly frustrated with having my son waste a lot of time on a fun but mindless game while he was still struggling to master his sight words and learning to read. \r\n\r\nSo I decided to create our very own Sight Words slicing game and to my and my son's delight, he now has a new favorite game where he is having fun and learning at the same time. \r\n\r\nMy sons skills in recognizing Sight Words have dramatically improved since he started playing this game and now I no longer have to feel guilty when I need a five minute break to take care of the laundry or prepare lunch for the kids.  I know that they are having fun and that they are learning at the same time.\r\n\r\nWarning: Your child will keep begging for your iPhone or iPad after they try this app.\r\n\r\nSight Words Ninja is an exciting educational game that helps kids rapidly learn sight words by sight, sound, and touch.  \r\n\r\nThe interface is so easy to use that even a 9 month old baby will delight in using this app. \r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n• Slice your way through all sights words from preschool to grade 3\r\n\r\n• You decide what to focus on - turn individual categories ON or OFF from the settings page\r\n\r\n• Learn by sight, sound, and touch\r\n\r\n• Fun game play, sounds, and animations keep kids engaged\r\n\r\n• Dynamic game play adjusts difficulty (the number of sight words) automatically based on player skills to keep kids both challenged and entertained vs. getting bored\r\n\r\n• Supports 3 difficulty settings: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD\r\n\r\nEASY MODE:\r\n- Max 1 sight word\r\n- Sight words move very slowly\r\n- Great for introducing sight words one at a time\r\n\r\nMEDIUM MODE:\r\n- Starts with 1 sight word\r\n- Max of 3 sight words on screen\r\n- Sight words move 30% faster\r\n\r\nHARD MODE:\r\n- Starts with 2 sight words\r\n- Max of 5 sight words on screen\r\n- Sight words move even faster\r\n- Sight words rotate faster too\r\n\r\nAdjust difficulty from settings page. \r\n \r\n• Wrong answers do not interfere with gameplay, the child can immediately try again and slice the correct answer (most other games are too slow to keep kids interested by interrupting the gameplay and slowly repeating the desired question)\r\n\r\n• Play Sight Words from A to Z or in random order (adjustable from settings page)\r\n\r\n• Multi-sensory learning tool - combining audio, voice, and touch\r\n\r\n• Want to work on just a few Sight Words?  No problem… head to the settings page to turn entire categories or individual Sight Words on and off\r\n\r\n• Want to record your own audios? No problem.  Just click on the category and record your own Sight Words sounds \r\n\r\n• Supports three levels of difficulty \r\n\r\nHEROIC SUPPORT\r\n\r\nHeroic Support is not just what we do.  It's really what makes us, well, us.  It's that drive to make a difference in your life - no matter how big or small.

Can you tell the difference between excitement and fear, or between aggression and the need to play?\r\n\r\nDog language can be confusing, but with the help of Dog Decoder, you’ll understand your dog’s signals like a pro.\r\n\r\nDog Decoder will teach you everything you need to know about how your dog communicates, so you can not only avoid bites, but share in a more satisfying, healthy, and loving relationship.\r\n\r\n=== MEET “DIAMOND” === \r\n\r\nDiamond is your tour guide and trainer. He will show you how he looks when he’s afraid, when he’s stressed, when he’s just about to bite, and when he wants to play. \r\n\r\n=== DOG POSTURES ===\r\n\r\nThere are about SIXTY different poses on display in Dog Decoder. Each pose is beautifully and expressively illustrated by one of the world’s top dog artists.\r\n\r\nEach pose comes with a diagram, pointing out where on Diamond’s body he’s indicating how he’s feeling. For example, in the poses for “fear,” the diagram will point out Diamond’s tucked tail, his ears pulled back, etc. We won’t just show you a picture of a scared dog — we’ll teach you what to look for, the signs of fear.\r\n\r\nEach pose also comes with a helpful description of the context. This is where you will learn about some common misconceptions, or what kinds of situations will cause your dog to assume each posture.\r\n\r\n=== TEST YOURSELF! ===\r\n\r\nThe best way to see how much you’ve learned is to take the quiz! Some of the quiz questions are pretty challenging. Diamond wants to make sure you don’t get fooled next time he’s hiding under the coffee table or drooling – will you recognize the early warning signs of stress? Will you be able to warn your children when your dog is clearly done playing?"

Features include enhanced graphics and interactivity, Classical Conversations® Classical Acts & Facts® timeline, and the U.S. presidents!\n\nClassical educators know the importance of memorizing the grammar—the basic facts and vocabulary—of a subject. Now you can memorize the foundational knowledge of seven topics in a fun, interactive iPad and iPhone application. \n\nIn Cycle 2, Classical Conversations students memorize 161 events and people in the timeline, including the U.S. presidents; 24 history sentences from medieval to modern world history; 24 sites or features of European and world geography; 24 science questions and answers on ecology, astronomy, and physics; multiplication tables (1 through 15), squares, roots, cubes, and basic math laws and conversions; Latin verb endings; and English grammar rules. This app corresponds to the Foundations Curriculum, Fifth Edition Second Printing.\n\nMedieval to modern world history is presented in an interactive application with songs and artwork designed to make memorizing enjoyable.\n\nNow integrated with other Classical Conversations resources, each history sentence and science question points you to the corresponding Classical Acts & Facts® card, handy flashcards for classical educators that will expand your memory work in depth and breadth.\n\nNo matter your age, you can build a firm foundation of knowledge by memorizing these building blocks of education.\n\nClassical Conversations Foundations students, ages 4 through 12, have been using these tools in our online subscription service, CC Connected®. The iPad and iPhone application offers these features:\n• Touch screen slides horizontally to reveal memory work by subject\n• Touch screen slides vertically to study each subject by week\n• Touch screen allows students to slide back and forth through the U.S. presidents \n• Navigates back and forth and home easily\n\nClassical Conversations® empowers homeschooling parents and establishes classical, Christian communities that equip children with a biblical worldview and the classical tools of learning in order to impact the world for God’s glory.\n\nVisit us online to learn more: \nClassicalConversations.com\nClassicalConversationsBooks.com\n\nPlease send questions or comments to: customerservice@classicalconversations.com"

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

      "label": "You’ve discovered the Original and World Famous iFart® App.  An Apple All-Time TOP 20 App.  The definitive Fart Sounds app on iTunes.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nFeatured on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Today Show and many others, iFart® is considered the most infamous app of all time. \r\n\r\nAlso seen in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, MSNBC.com, MacDailyNews, MacForums, The New York Times, Barron's, Motley Fool, Gizmodo, Venture Beat, Ars Technica, CNET News, Geek.com, Forbes, The UK Register, Information Week, TechCrunch.com and dozens of publications all over the world!\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\niFart® took the app world by storm in 2008. It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

Take a ride on the airplane, shoot some hoops, play hide & seek and bed trampoline or get creative with paw painting - you can always have a great time with your kitten pal! Explore the kitten's world and discover cute animations, laugh with and care for your adorable, realistic pet.\nThe unique game-design encourages children to explore the room with minimal use of icons or menus. The 7 mini-games offer a wide variety of interactions and are designed so they appeal to a wide age range. The philosophy is not about winning, losing or competition, it's about having fun in a child-friendly environment and learning without even realizing it! Great Mini-Games with purpose!:\n\nCompatibility: The App doesn't support iPad2, iPhone 4s, iPad Mini1, iPod5 with iOS9\n\n1) Kitten Hide&Seek - encourages focus and attention.\n2) Paw Painting - creativity unleashed! Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children. Parents have the option to limit screen time for their kids: after a chosen time, the kitten gets tired and goes to sleep.\nLittle Kitten is a high-tech app - using the latest 3d animation technology to create the visuals, it also uses cutting edge programming to maximize the user experience on your apple device. Enjoy the premium quality content in this original app brought to you by Squeakosaurus.

No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal."

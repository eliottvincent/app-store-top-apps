Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science.

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory.

It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

Stop and start talking on multiple conversations whenever you like.\n\nThis app is uniquely designed for the iPhone, with chat bubbles scrolling by. Change their shade to suit your mood.\n\nYou need to be online to talk - the app has to communicate with servers - but even slow connections are fine.\n\nThe keyboard in the screenshots is Tyyyp, which uses Cleverbot AI, and works well with the Cleverbot app!\n\nFor an app with an emotional avatar too, and with iPad support, check out Cleverbot HD. \n\n\n\nThis app has reached the top 50 overall in the US and has remained mostly inside the top 20 Entertainment for over 18 months.\n\n***Over 2000 5 star ratings worldwide.***\n\nNot only that, our feedback is GREAT too...!\n\n\"To all the Luddites who claim computers can never replace human interaction you guys flip a defiant bird.\" 25th Sept 2013\n\n\"I can't believe I'm not talking to an actual person, it seems so real. Great work.\" 8th Sept 2013\n\n\"Super excellent. I am very much excited, entertained, interested\" 1st March 2013\n\n\"Omg !!! Its so amazing!!! Now its my new BFF :p\" 25th Oct 2011\n\n\"Seriously this may be the coolest thing anyone has ever developed. I salute you.\" 25th Aug 2011\n\n\"Truly Amazing - I just had like an hours chat with it.

He's there when I want to talk about dolphins, There when I want to ask him where babies come from, I am glad I found him. He talks about anything. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. Thank god you made this.\" 30th Jan 2011\n\n\"After about one day with this I found the bot will role-play with you and had a blast! After a few *slaps* I found it can fight. You can live out movie fight scenes WITH AN AI! Then it started doing things I didn't know it could do... like *kisses hard* or *hurls you into fan*... yep it gets intense. No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

Thanks to the magnetometers present in the latest generation mobile phones *, you too can try your hand at researching variations in the electromagnetic field.\n\nIts functions are similar to those of a KII but enhanced for use on a smartphone. The more the electromagnetic field variations will be strong, the more the LEDs will light up to red.\n\nREM:\n\nThe Rem is an electronic device that allows you to receive answers to your questions.\n\nThe Rem has a built-in word database. Whenever a considerable variation in electromagnetism is recorded, the amplitude and intensity values ​​are combined to select a word from the reference database.\n\nThe first screen will show the word while the second will record the electromagnetism variations that caused the selection of that word.\n\nBLACK BOX:\nThis fantastic instrument perceives random chaotic noise and connects to a phonetic database from which it is possible to listen to the formation of words divided into syllables. Ask your question and listen to the answers that will come. Try to understand the words that will come out by joining the single phonemes.\n\nINFO ON OPERATION:\n\nTo test m1 just enter M1 function and approach an electrical socket or an electronic device on and the instrument will immediately show a change in magnetism.\n\nThanks to an algorithm developed by Team Pit, the App creates a triangulation between the three magnets inside the latest generation mobile phones to accurately calculate the magnetic anomalies in the environment.\n\n*ATTENTION*\n\nIn older mobile phones without the 3 magnetometers now used in most mobile phones, the app will not work properly and the M1 will light up with just the movement of the mobile phone. This is because it will simulate a compass and give false positive answers to just the movement of the mobile. \""

      "label": "Synopsis:\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Moth Lake,\r\na small town that, behind its peaceful facade, hides a terrible secret.\r\nOnly a group of teenagers, with a difficult life, will reveal what has been hidden for generations.\r\n\r\nMysterious events will intensify starting from the eve of a solar eclipse,\r\nand our young friends will start a journey into the shadow and into their own soul.\r\n\r\nWhat to expect from this game:\r\nIn short:\r\n•2.5D pixel art (Frame to frame animations, as if we are still in '90s)\r\n• Simple controls (Supporting touch screen, mouse, keyboard and controllers)\r\n• Unconventional puzzles (Don't worry, there's a free walkthrough if you need help!)\r\n• Stealth-action\r\n• Choices that will change the bonds between the characters as well as the spirit of the experience (Just like in life, a choice can make the difference between friendship, love, hate, life or death)\r\n• Thrills, suspense and horror (Not a survival game, but it can be creepy or scary at times)\r\n• Bad humor and strong language (They are teenagers, don't judge them)\r\n• At some point this experience might even move you to tear (I'm not crying, I just got a pixel in my eye)\r\n• 6 different endings\n• A soundtrack that is original, suggestive, and exciting\r\n\r\nIn detail:\r\n\r\nMoth Lake is a story-driven experience, with a lot of textual contents (more than 20k words), and hundreds of different scenes (more than 300 scenarios).\r\n\r\nThe script is a long journey through a mystery, through horrors and through the characters hearts.\r\nIt contains dark topics and very sad stuff, but also a lot of nonsense jokes and weird conversations, so it's hard to say whether it is a horror game or not.\r\n\r\nThe main characters move around a 2.5D world, interacting with many hotspots and NPCs.\r\nThey can pull objects and perform a set of specific actions to solve very different puzzles.\r\n\r\nThe artwork is a modern pixel art, with a big colour palette and a lot of frame-to-frame animations.\r\nThere's a very large set of animations, including talking, walking, running, crouching, crawling, pushing, climbing, sneaking, punching, throwing... and much more.\r\n\r\nScenarios have some modern lighting/shading work, with particles effects and a constant use of parallax, to simulate a 3D environment.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 main characters and more than 50 NPCs, with their own look and personality. You can control 7 characters through the main story and more in the additional chapters.\r\nThey all move their eyes, they change facial expressions, and they have some peculiar behaviours.\r\n\r\nAs the story proceeds, the player has to take some choices, affecting the characters mood and sometimes even the plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor most of the time the player controls a character surrounded by his/her friends.\r\nEach one has some kind of skill to be used at the right moment, and sometimes even their personality will be important to solve a puzzle.\r\n\r\nSome puzzles can be solved by a single character, while other must be solved using the whole squad cooperation.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the game aims to give psychological horror vibes.\r\nSo keep in mind that this game is not for everyone! Some scenes are disturbing, some scenes may give you anxiety, and some other scenes are extremely sad.\r\n\r\nCharacters are constantly called to face their difficult past, and to go through their scary present.\r\nThey need to hide, to take terrible decisions and sometimes even to fight for their lives.\r\n\r\n...But after all, your choices can lead you to the best possible ending, and if you fail, you can always try again."

      "label": "Necrophone Pro is a real ghost app designed specifically for spirit communication and paranormal research. This spirit box contains a preloaded soundbank with a large variety of words, similar to ghost tube.\n\nNew features in the ghost box include white noise, reverb and echo. This ITC ghost hunting app has a very creepy vibe, and gives good results whilst trying to communicate with the dead.\n\nThe sound bank files use a the full range of low, mid and high frequencies making it much easier for communication with the dead.\n\nOur real ghost app contains full and partial words in English at varying quality levels. And partial words in other languages. Sample partial phonetic words include things such as bi, bo, um, ye, na.\n\nOur spirit box may sound similar to other ghost hunting tools such as Necrophonic, Paratek ghost box, DeadWave spirit box and Ghost Tube.\n\nThe white noise background in our real ghost app can be turned on and off, and the background is a moving video to give a creepy and spooky vibe to get you in the mood for your ghost hunting app.\n\nIf you want to record your spirit box session you can use a separate EVP recorder or ghost tube with it. Or use with an EMF meter to detect any electrical spikes while using Necrophone ghost hunting tools to communicate with the spirits. Or an SLS camera, like ghost tube to be able to see them as well.\n\n*No Advertisements\n*No Popups\n*No Subscriptions\n*No In App Purchases\n*Lifetime Use\n\nQUICK TIPS: Never go out alone, especially in abandoned places, always take a friend or family member to stay safe when using ghost hunting tools. Ensure you choose a location which is known to be haunted. As no real responses will come through if there are no spirits. Only randomly generated words. Always be polite to the spirits and don't challenge them whilst using ghost hunting tools.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This ghost hunting app picks words at random from the word bank. It is believed that ghosts are able to manipulate electrical devices, and may be able to override the words which the ghost box picks. But there is no guarantee or scientifical evidence to prove this. So please use our real ghost app at your own risk.\n\n\nHow to get the most from your ghost hunting tools\n\n1. Before using your ghost hunting app, picked a haunted place. No real ghost app will work if there are not any ghosts in the location you are at. First find a haunted location, which will dramatically increase the chances of getting replies from your ghost app or spirit box.\n\n2. Once you have picked your haunted location, take some friends or family members with you to ensure your safety whilst using your real ghost app. Using your real ghost app and ghost box is always more fun with friends.\n\n3. Once you arrive at the haunted place, say hello to the spirits and introduce yourself before using your ghost hunting tools. Treat spirits like people, they will be much more likely to respond if you are polite to them. Once ready, you can start your real ghost app session. Start your ghost box and ask if any spirits are there. Once you start getting intelligent responses from the ghost app or spirit box, you can start documenting your evidence.\n\nYOUR GHOST BOX AND SPIRIT BOX CAN BE VERY HELPFUL COMMUNICATION WITH THE OTHER SIDE. But you also need to increase your chances be ensuring spirits are there, and you are polite to them. Don't just ask the same repetitive questions, think of something new, original and engaging."

Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes.

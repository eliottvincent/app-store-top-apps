The first \"envelope\" is for your income, this contains the income source(s) and income amount(s) you supplied.

Simply enter the corresponding information into the input areas and let us take care of figuring out your monthly retirement allowance!\n\nNot sure how much to tip?

More detailed planning is useful, but this simple enough-to-retire calculation method offers a great starting place. Be sure to contact a financial professional. Add any additional guaranteed income to this amount to calculate available income."

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nAdding Machine features dual keypads with a total (*) key on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n====  Recent Press  =====\nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category for iPad.\n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key Adding Machine app.\"\n=================\n\n\nSpecifications:\n=================\n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine.\n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility.\n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history (full version)\n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float\n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use.\n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines\n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style)\n● Comprehensive set of help screens.\n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region).\n\n \n================\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calculator’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

      "label": "This app was designed to aid you to determine how much debt you could afford compared to your existing income. This app will tell you the ratio between your current income and  debt.\n\nWhat is a debt-to-income ratio?\n\nDebt to income ratio (DTI) is the amount of your total monthly bills divided by how much money you make a month. It allows lenders to determine the likelihood that you would be able to repay a loan.\n\nFor instance, if you pay $2,000 a month for a mortgage, $300 a month for an auto loan and $700 a month for the rest of your bills, you have a total monthly debt of $3,000.\n\nIf your gross monthly income is $7,000, you divide that into the debt ($3,000 / 7,000) and your debt-to-income ratio is 42.8%.\n\nMost lenders would like your debt-to-income ratio to be under 35%. However, you can receive a qualified mortgage with as high as a 43% debt-to-income ratio.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Board, the household debt service payments and financial obligations as a percentage of disposable personal income was 10.1% in the first quarter of 2017. That is down from the high of 18.1 in December of 2009.\n\nThe ratio is best figured on a monthly basis. For example, if your monthly take-home pay is $2,000 and you pay $400 per month in debt payment for loans and credit cards, your debt-to-income ratio is 20 percent ($400 divided by $2,000 = .20).\n\nPut another way, the ratio is a percent of your income that is pre-promised to debt payments. If your ratio is 40%, that means you have pre-promised 40% of your future income to pay debts.\n\nWhy Debt-To-Income Ratio % Matters\n\nWhile there is no law establishing a definitive debt-to-income ratio that requires lenders to make a loan, there are some accepted standards, especially as it regard federal home loans.\n\nFor example, if you qualify for a VA loan, the department of Veteran Affairs guidelines suggest a 41% debt-to-income ratio. FHA loans will allow for a ratio of 43%. It is possible to get a VA or FHA loan with a higher ratio, but only when there compensating factors.\n\nThe ratio needed for conventional loans varies, depending on the lending institution. Most banks rely on the 43% figure for debt-to-income, but it could be as high as 50%, depending on factors like income and credit card debt. Larger lenders, with large assets, are more likely to accept consumers with a high income-to-debt ratio, but only if they have a personal relationship with the customer or believe there is enough income to cover all debts.\n\nRemember, evidence shows that the higher the ratio, the more likely the borrower is going to have problems paying."

This helps with repetitive computations where you are examining the consequence of changing one variable at a time."

Fibonacci retracement levels use horizontal lines to indicate areas of support or resistance at the key Fibonacci levels before the trend continues in the original direction. These levels are created by drawing a trendline between the high and low and then dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 100%."

Expenses and revenue don't change the entity's equity before the current year is over, but the filter calendar allows you to change the year for calculations at any time. Monthly results will be presented in your income statements, while annual results are going to be shown in your balance sheets. \n\nWith a single tap you can create 12 accounts, 6 combinations and 6 journal entries for testing. Another single tap allows you to delete all test data at once, including manually created journal entries and combinations that are associated with the automatically created test data."

Sometimes we need help...and that's where this app comes into the picture.\n\nThe Defer My Pay app effortlessly guides you through 3 simple questions (while _never_ asking for, or collecting, personally identifiable information) and then instantly presents you with a customized deferred payment plan that works for both the debtor and the creditor (i.e. the one paying and the one collecting). You can even move back and forth through the questions and adjust as needed. This allows the people on both sides of the transaction get to keep the roof over their heads and food on their tables. It's a win-win.\n\nWe're in this together.\nEverything will be OK.\nLet's work something out."

      "label": "Have you ever wondered what your money could be worth in 30 years if you saved it instead of spent it? Compound Interest answers that question by helping you calculate what your money could be worth if you saved it or invested it over time.\n\nImagine you started saving for retirement when you're just 15 instead of 40. Put away $100 bucks a week with 7% returns. By the time you hit retirement age you'd have over 2 million dollars stashed away. You might ask yourself: how, doing the quick math that's only saving $260,000? Well, that is where compound interest comes into play. Even though you only earned and saved a little over $250,000 you gained over $2,000,000 in compound interest. Pretty cool right?\n\nAlready have an end goal in mind? Instead solve for contribution amount, return rate, or length. Want to retire with $5,000,000 but aren't sure how much you need to be saving each month to reach that goal? Switch the mode to solve for contribution amount and it will automatically calculate that number.\n\nSo check out this awesome compound interest calculator that lets you see your gains broken up by year with a cool interactive graph, multiple tabs, and light/dark themes.\n\nNotable Features:\n- The ability to create additional tabs to allow you to calculate as many sets of data and outputs as you want.\n- Ability to solve for different values like total amount, length, contribution amount, or the return rate you might need to achieve your goals.\n- Tab References: You can now reference one tab's total balance in another's initial balance. This is great for scenarios where you want to change the contribution amount or return rate in future years. For example, you can now experiment with the scenario of contributing $500 for 10 years followed by $0 for the next 10 years, and see the effects of compound interest over a 20 year time period. To reference another tab just tap into the starting balance and you'll see a toolbar above the keyboard with tabs that can be referenced.\n- See data broken out by each year it's being compounded."

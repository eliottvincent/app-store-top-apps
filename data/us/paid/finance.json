In most cases, you only need:\n(1) Gesture swipe\n(2) Enter the amount\n(3) Finish\nYou don’t even need 3 seconds to add a expense record.\n\n3. iCloud synchronization, data more secure\nThe system supports synchronization, but you don't need to register for an account. Your data will not be sent to our server. You can rest assured that your data will not be seen by others.\n\n4.Simple and easy to use interactive interface, easier to get started\nThe user interface adopts a unique solid color design, which is not only beautiful and fashionable, but also concise and clear, so that you can easily operate it. Our goal is to let you develop the habit of bookkeeping without any guidance.\n\n5. Exquisite and practical statistical graph, more comprehensive analysis\nDo you often lack money, but don’t know where you spent it? With the help of bar charts and pie charts, you can not only track your daily expenses and understand your consumption behavior, but you can also develop targeted future consumption plans to save unnecessary expenses.\n\n6. Use Widget to build your Home Screen budget system\nNo need to enter the app,  you can track your expenditure and budget information at any time through the Widget.\n\n\n\nUnlike similar products that emphasize more functions, we always adhere to the design principle of \"less is more\". After continuous improvement, continuous addition and deletion, finally, this application was born.\n\nThank you for using this app. If you love it, please give it a good review."

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nAdding Machine features dual keypads with a total (*) key on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n====  Recent Press  =====\nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category for iPad.\n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key Adding Machine app.\"\n=================\n\n\nSpecifications:\n=================\n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine.\n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility.\n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history (full version)\n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float\n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use.\n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines\n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style)\n● Comprehensive set of help screens.\n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region).\n\n \n================\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calculator’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

      "label": "Have you ever wondered what your money could be worth in 30 years if you saved it instead of spent it? Compound Interest answers that question by helping you calculate what your money could be worth if you saved it or invested it over time.\n\nImagine you started saving for retirement when you're just 15 instead of 40. Put away $100 bucks a week with 7% returns. By the time you hit retirement age you'd have over 2 million dollars stashed away. You might ask yourself: how, doing the quick math that's only saving $260,000? Well, that is where compound interest comes into play. Even though you only earned and saved a little over $250,000 you gained over $2,000,000 in compound interest. Pretty cool right?\n\nAlready have an end goal in mind? Instead solve for contribution amount, return rate, or length. Want to retire with $5,000,000 but aren't sure how much you need to be saving each month to reach that goal? Switch the mode to solve for contribution amount and it will automatically calculate that number.\n\nSo check out this awesome compound interest calculator that lets you see your gains broken up by year with a cool interactive graph, multiple tabs, and light/dark themes.\n\nNotable Features:\n- The ability to create additional tabs to allow you to calculate as many sets of data and outputs as you want.\n- Ability to solve for different values like total amount, length, contribution amount, or the return rate you might need to achieve your goals.\n- Tab References: You can now reference one tab's total balance in another's initial balance. This is great for scenarios where you want to change the contribution amount or return rate in future years. For example, you can now experiment with the scenario of contributing $500 for 10 years followed by $0 for the next 10 years, and see the effects of compound interest over a 20 year time period. To reference another tab just tap into the starting balance and you'll see a toolbar above the keyboard with tabs that can be referenced.\n- See data broken out by each year it's being compounded."

It is NOT a bloated pocket version of a money managing application, but simply a mobile transaction-creating interface (i.e. it does not sync both ways with Quicken).  Hopefully others will have found this as useful as I have.  Please note that your desktop finance application must be able to import QIF files.  \nKNOWN ISSUES:  \n- PLEASE VERIFY YOUR VERSION OF QUICKEN CAN IMPORT QIF FILES BEFORE PURCHASING.  There are some newer versions where Intuit has been trying to deprecate the use of the QIF format in favor of the proprietary OFX format.

Trade Risk Manager allows you to do just that by knowing exactly what your position size would need to be - based on your account size, stock purchase price and stop-loss location - so that you’re never risking more than a predetermined amount of your portfolio on each trade.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nWith the lastest version (1.0.4) you can now CUSTOMIZE your Equity Risk percentages or select four different default position sizes based on market conditions as shown below:\n\nDefault Position Sizes / Total Account Equity at Risk\n\nSmall / (.0625%)\nMedium / (.125%)\nLarge / (.25%)\nFull / (.5%)\n\nOnce a few simple parameters are entered, Trade Risk Manager will calculate the following for you:\n\nTotal Money at Risk\nTotal Position Size (in dollars)\nNumber of Shares to Buy\n\n\n\nDisclosures\n\nInvesting is risky and could result in the total loss of invested principal, even with risk management precautions in place. Therefore, one should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing. Trade Risk Manager does not offer financial advice, but functions as a calculator to measure possible portfolio risk. By using this app you are acknowledging that you alone accept full responsibility for all investment decisions made and will not hold Trade Risk Manager or its makers responsible for any losses incurred due to investing."

      "label": "Have you ever wanted to see how much money you have made on a job at any given time after the job has started? Well now you can with the \"Time to Money\" App! Simply open the App, enter your hourly rate, and tap the Start button when you begin a job and watch your earnings grow per second! You can enter your device into sleep mode, exit the App, or even completely power off your device and whenever you open \"Time to Money\" again, it will update your earnings from the time you tapped the Start button to the current time and continue to calculate each second! On a break? No worries. Just tap the Pause button, and when you are ready to continue the job, tap the Resume button. Finished with a job? Nice work! Tap the End button to end the job and save a log! These logs can be viewed at any moment and contain information about that job. In addition, you can also set a goal that you wish to reach. Your goal can be changed at any time. There is also a \"Time to Money\" App for Apple Watch, where you can watch your earnings grow right on your wrist! And better yet, the Apple Watch version of the App can easily be accessed via a Watch face complication (there are multiple complication styles to choose from). Tap the complication, and see your earnings at a glance from within the App! The Apple Watch version of the App is also linked with the iPhone version of the App, ensuring that if you tap Start on one device, it will begin on the other device as well! When you tap the End button on the Apple Watch version of the App, a log is sent to your Phone. Oh yeah, and one more thing! After tapping the Start or Resume button, you will receive hourly notifications that let you know how much money you have made so far to help motivate you while you work!"

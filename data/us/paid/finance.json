We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.â¨â¨They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".â¨â¨ Great product. Thanks.\""

Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. Itâs beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while âAccountant Calculatorâ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, â, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer.

Â This Universal currency conversion application for the iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch shows you what you're paying instantly and is easy to use even when you have jet lag.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Currency Calculator\n- Apple Watch Support\n- Today Widget\n- Support For Over 150 World Currencies, Precious Metals & Bitcoin\n- Historical Charts\n- Trend Analysis\n- Background Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\n- Editable Calculator Tape\n- Inverse Currency Calculations\n- Transaction Fees or Taxes\n- 100% Ad Free\n\nWhat Makes Currency+ stand out from other Currency Apps?\n\nCurrency Calculator\nWhen you are traveling in a different country, most of the time your focus will be on converting the local currency back to your home currency. The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

You can enter your device into sleep mode, exit the App, or even completely power off your device and whenever you open \"Time to Money\" again, it will update your earnings from the time you tapped the Start button to the current time and continue to calculate each second! On a break? No worries. Just tap the Pause button, and when you are ready to continue the job, tap the Resume button. Finished with a job? Nice work! Tap the End button to end the job and save a log! These logs can be viewed at any moment and contain information about that job. In addition, you can also set a goal that you wish to reach. Your goal can be changed at any time. There is also a \"Time to Money\" App for Apple Watch, where you can watch your earnings grow right on your wrist! And better yet, the Apple Watch version of the App can easily be accessed via a Watch face complication (there are multiple complication styles to choose from). Tap the complication, and see your earnings at a glance from within the App! The Apple Watch version of the App is also linked with the iPhone version of the App, ensuring that if you tap Start on one device, it will begin on the other device as well! When you tap the End button on the Apple Watch version of the App, a log is sent to your Phone. Oh yeah, and one more thing! After tapping the Start or Resume button, you will receive hourly notifications that let you know how much money you have made so far to help motivate you while you work!"

These functions are especially useful to students learning about time value of money concepts.\n\nKey input variables are amount, annual interest rate, and term or length of time.\n\nThe term and the frequency of compounding or discounting can be set to monthly, quarterly, or annual intervals.\n\nOnce a computation has been performed for a particular term, you can access a \"periodic table\" that displays the calculated results for all periods up to the term so you can see how the results will vary over time.\n\nChanges made to the variables for each function are saved for subsequent use, thereby simplifying the task of making changes to some variables while retaining others. This helps with repetitive computations where you are examining the consequence of changing one variable at a time."

Provides income, price charts as well as numerical output.Â Built with data collaboration from EODHistoricalData.com \n\nThe app is specifically built to bring out Total Returns that include dividends or bond interest, exclusion of which can cause ranking inversion and under-allocation to low volatility assets.\n\n#*# After tapping in a ticker or tickers, pls. hit 'return' *not* Swipe. Then Swipe between screens.\n\n#*# Share charts using the iPhone Screen Capture method to post online\n\n***Use the App to find ETFs, stocks and funds that have high Dividend yields. Web charts flatline such charts, since they are price only.\n\n***A simple way to find your ticker syntax is to look it up via EODHistoricalData.com {U.S. listed tickers do not require .US extension, eg MSFT and MSFT.us are both OK; SAP.xetra, 6752.tse for Panasonic, DJI.indx for Dow Jones index etc.}\n\n-Backtest your portfolio on the fly (stress testing) with total returns that include dividends / bond interest. See how your stocks would do say from 1/2007-3/2009 or 1/2020-3/2020\n\n-Designed by a Finance professor and a development team from Canada, Germany and Switzerland, this app has had thousands of downloads since 2012 (free for my students), pls. see cloudEpsilon.com or CorrectCharts.com for the idea, research and examples.\n\n-The problem being rectified by the App has also been written up in the WSJ (Jul 2011). \n\n-No tables, numbers, dividends, interest, splits or distributions to download -  enter the ticker, the Start and End dates, swipe. Done! Allows comparison of up to 8 tickers, at a time. \n\n-Total Returns are useful for calculating income tax and investment taxes too.  The App also lets you compare a security with itself so you instantly see the return differential. Touch the radio button on the output screen for 'price only' returns.\n-\"App is unique and useful but needs an iOS13 update.\" ~ 2020\n-Some user requests for the iOS8 upgrade, 2015: \n\" Yes, Iâm in finance. Itâs an incredibly useful tool to be able to chart it this way. Thanks!\" Wealth manager from Texas.\n\"Please, please, please tell me you're going to have a updated version for iOS 8. This is the best app ever.\" CFA from Ohio.\n\"Is the App getting an update to be co playable with iOS8? It's such a useful app!\" Football Quarterback.\n\"This helps me build my portfolio and review investments: total return vs. yield vs. capital gains compared between investments and also combined into a portfolio.\"\n\"Thank you... As I said, I really like it and have not found an alternative.\" MIT alum.\n\n-Google_Finance, Bloomberg web and [Yahoo ] stock charts do not include dividends in total return or comparative return charts. \n\n-You can input multiple securities at the same time to see cumulative return charts and associated return numbers. You have the option to see charts inclusive or exclusive of dividends and interest (Total return or Price return).  Just three screens and a few taps. Done!  \n\n-The App has been downloaded in USA, Australia, Switzerland, France, Finland, Sweden, Taiwan, Mexico, Thailand, UK, China, Turkey, Israel, Portugal, Japan, India, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand).\n\nThanks and please leave a review on the App store, we have no marketing.\n\nhttp://cloudepsilon.com\n\nPlease note:\nâ¢ A one time payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nâ¢ Data licensing restricts us from offering a free trial period\n\nTOS: http://correctcharts.com/returnfinder/img/disclaimer_returnfinder.pdf\nEULA: \nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy: http://correctcharts.com/returnfinder/img/privacy_policy_returnfinder.pdf"

This easy-to-use app helps you eliminate debt using the âdebt snowballâ method that is taught and endorsed by many financial professionals. \n\nFeatured in Parade Magazine's Intelligence Report. (April 2012)\n\nFeatured in iTunes \"Top 20 apps in 2011 to improve your fitness and finances\"\n\nThe best Debt Snowball app in iTunes\n\nThis app is used and recommended by many financial advisors, firms, and banks.  Simply input your debts (including balance, interest rate, and monthly payment) and Debt Snowball Pro will help you select the best payoff method.\n\nUsing the debt snowball method of payment, once you pay off a debt, youâll apply the previous payment to the next debt, resulting in a snowball effect as the amount paid toward your larger loans grows over time.\n\nYou can choose to pay off debts with higher interest rates first (to save money), or those with the lowest balances (for small, motivating successes along the way). Debt Snowball Pro shows you just how much money youâll save by choosing these methods over making minimum payments.\n\nView our demonstration on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ4Ce7ujDxc\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\nâ¢Easy-to-use interface.\nâ¢Password protection.\nâ¢Ability to add and remove debts, update balances, and see when you will be debt-free.\nâ¢Shows interest saved and debt payoff dates.\nâ¢Detailed Payment Schedule spreadsheet, showing effects of applying snowball payments to individual debts.\nâ¢Ability to quickly make payments on individual loans.\nâ¢iCloud support so you can easily share data between devices.\nâ¢Progress bars to show and encourage progress.\nâ¢Custom notification to remind you when each bill is due.\nâ¢Ability to share on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nNOTE:\nThis also makes a great gift to family and friends.  Click the down arrow on the left (next to Buy App) and choose \"Gift This App\".\n\nCOMMENTS:\nPlease send your comments, suggestions, and questions to matt.l.king@comcast.net.\n\nREVIEWS:\n\"This is an excellent App! One of the most important keys to success when trying to get out of debt is âConcentrationâ on the goal.  The Debt Snowball is a goal. Having the information readily available to look at may keep more people motivated towards attaining their goal of becoming debt free.\"\n- enemyofdebt.com\n\n\"My husband and I both use Debt Snowball Pro.  The peace of mind that I got from having a plan set and seeing the \"end date goal\" is worth every penny.  Before using Debt Snowball there was a constant nagging feeling in the back of my head that kept me from ever being completely relaxed.  Now, with the goal in site I feel so much better about our situation.  If you have several loans you should not hesitate, get the app.  Follow the steps and get your own peace of mind and start working toward freedom from debt\"\n- AquababeJen\n\n\"Great app to manage and control your debts.  Simple to use and understand and can save you a ton of real money\"\n-casey_tx\n\nIf you like this app you will also like our other apps:\nMortgage Calculator +\nLoan Calculator - What if?\nRandom Fun Facts\nScripture of the Day - (NASB Version)\nToday in American History\nRandom Crazy Illusions\nTravel Bingo & Blackout\nGrocery Bingo\nBizarre Holidays"

The Treasury provides daily updates on-line lagged by 24 hours and the app retrieves the update spreadsheet for the past 200 days when it is connected to the Internet. \n\nAdditionally, you may plot the yield curve and get an estimate of the yield for all months from 1 to 360 (1 month to 30 years) by means of a slider.\n\nThe estimated yields are computed by linear interpolation between the actual yields.

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key Universal' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nThis universal version works with both iPhone and iPad. The iPad version features a full sized (1:1) keypad with TypeTone, a unique audio aid to help guide your finger back to the center of a key. The total (*) key (iPad or iPhone) can be on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine 10Key Univ Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n==== Recent Press ===== \nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category. \n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key for iPad.\" \n================= \n\n\nSpecifications: \n================= \n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine. \n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility. \n● TypeTone - a major innovation to aid accurate key entry using audio feedback (iPad version). \n● Full size (1:1) keyboard (iPad version). \n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history. \n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float \n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use. \n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines \n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style) \n● Comprehensive set of help screens. \n● 4 Orientations: Landscape Left/Right + Portrait (iPad version) \n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region). \n\n\n================ \n\nFAQ's \n\nQ1. What is the difference between this App, 'Adding Machine 10Key Universal', and 'Accountant Universal for iPad' in the App. Store.? \nA1. Both calculators are single-column adding machines or calculators with full-size (1:1) keypads and are optimized for the iPad User Interface. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calc’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works. \n\nQ2. Can I touch-type? \nA2. The iPad version comes as close to touch-typing as a touch-screen can be. v2.1 introduces TypeTone. With TypeTone, a key will guide your finger back to the center of a key with an audio tone. \n\nQ3. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape? \nA3. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers, split Add/Sub or Mul/Div groups. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA5. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

Sometimes we need help...and that's where this app comes into the picture.\n\nThe Defer My Pay app effortlessly guides you through 3 simple questions (while _never_ asking for, or collecting, personally identifiable information) and then instantly presents you with a customized deferred payment plan that works for both the debtor and the creditor (i.e. the one paying and the one collecting). You can even move back and forth through the questions and adjust as needed. This allows the people on both sides of the transaction get to keep the roof over their heads and food on their tables.

      "label": "Have you ever wondered what your money could be worth in 30 years if you saved it instead of spent it? Compound Interest answers that question by helping you calculate what your money could be worth if you saved it or invested it over time.\n\nImagine you started saving for retirement when you're just 15 instead of 40. Put away $100 bucks a week with 7% returns. By the time you hit retirement age you'd have over 2 million dollars stashed away. You might ask yourself: how, doing the quick math that's only saving $260,000? Well, that is where compound interest comes into play. Even though you only earned and saved a little over $250,000 you gained over $2,000,000 in compound interest. Pretty cool right?\n\nAlready have an end goal in mind? Instead solve for contribution amount, return rate, or length. Want to retire with $5,000,000 but aren't sure how much you need to be saving each month to reach that goal? Switch the mode to solve for contribution amount and it will automatically calculate that number.\n\nSo check out this awesome compound interest calculator that lets you see your gains broken up by year with a cool interactive graph, multiple tabs, and light/dark themes.\n\nNotable Features:\n- The ability to create additional tabs to allow you to calculate as many sets of data and outputs as you want.\n- Ability to solve for different values like total amount, length, contribution amount, or the return rate you might need to achieve your goals.\n- Tab References: You can now reference one tab's total balance in another's initial balance. This is great for scenarios where you want to change the contribution amount or return rate in future years. For example, you can now experiment with the scenario of contributing $500 for 10 years followed by $0 for the next 10 years, and see the effects of compound interest over a 20 year time period. To reference another tab just tap into the starting balance and you'll see a toolbar above the keyboard with tabs that can be referenced.\n- See data broken out by each year it's being compounded."

All emails have been answered and explained and there has not been a wrong calculation since version 1.1.\nPlease if your email was replied and solved, change the review since it makes it look bad for everybody else."

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

You can also print blank checks to take with you. \n\nUse as many bank accounts as you want. Each will have its own account number, user information and bank information.\n\nKeep track of all your expenses and deposits with the built-in electronic record book (Register). Balance is calculated automatically. Reconcile with your bank statement just as easily as you would with a paper record book. Save, load data and settings to use different accounts. Set different fonts to print your name on checks.\n\nCheck Writer Plus, will sign your checks automatically with your own picture. \n\nYou can add your logo next to your name and address.\n\nAll elements of the check can be moved to perfectly fit your needs, and you can decide which elements will be printed (convenient for pre-printed paper). \n\nPrint as many blank checks as you want to use them like regular checkbooks.\n\nExtremely accurate MICR E13B technology is used to print special characters at the bottom of checks so they are recognized by bank processing. This font is used daily by regional and nationals banks.\n\nThe Register can be printed in spreadsheet format. Search easily throughout the register content: date, number, memo, amount.\n\nPrint immediately or later, on top, middle, bottom, or three checks per page. Checks can be printed on regular letter-size paper, plain white or color, as well as on professional looking check refill paper available from fine office supply stores. Also, Versacheck #1000, #1001, #1002, #3000, and Personal # 3001.\n\nQuickBooks® or Quicken® paper stock can be used as well. Likewise, using the Blank Checks feature without lines, you can print check paper for QuickBooks® and Quicken®\n\nThe height of checks can be set in Preferences, to accommodate non standard pre-printed paper.\n\nPrinting can be nudged horizontally and vertically very precisely.\n\nWiFi and Google Print are supported.\n\nIMPORTANT :\n----------------\n\nCheck Writer Plus is meant for personal productivity. For uses like payroll or other corporate use, better look towards other, specialized applications.\n\nAs mentioned above, the MICR E13B font used in this application has been purchased by regional and national banks for their own use, after stringent tests. We are absolutely confident they will perform perfectly when used correctly. However, it is necessary to strictly follow these principles :\n\n1 - It is paramount never to use \"scale to fit\". Printing must be done at 100% to insure the MICR printing conforms to standard.\n\n2 - MICR Toner (magnetic ink) is mandatory to meet the American Banking Association MICR E13B standard and U.S. law (Check 21 Act). MICR E13B printing complies with ANSI X9.27-1995, ANSI X9.100-160-1-2009, and Canadian CPA006 standards.\n\nAlthough many banks today use Optical Character Recognition which accepts any ink, some are equipped with readers that require magnetic ink, and will be suspicious of checks printed with ordinary ink.\n\nMICR toner is indistinguishable of regular black toner, and can be acquired from fine office supply stores, Amazon, or other Internet toner vendors.\n\nIf you still have questions, or if you encounter any difficulties using this app, please use the support link to contact us, we will do all we can to help right away."

Input your pay check gross pay, pre-tax deductions (insurance, 401k, etc.), filing status, state, and withholding allowances from your W-4 and get an estimate of how much of each of your pay checks is going to the government, and how much is going into your pocket. You can see how to optimize your monthly budget and make sure you've had enough taxes held back for tax time!\n\nWant to get even more advanced? Switch over to the advanced view and you can enter extra withholding amounts for both Federal and State taxes, and separate filing status and withholding allowance amounts for your state to get an even more accurate picture of your tax withholding. WithholdingCalc lets you easily manipulate the numbers from your W-4 form to help you get an accurate picture of your budget and how much tax withholding you will have accumulated for tax season.\n\nWithholdingCalc is based on current 2018 tax rates for most federal and state tax rates for the 41 states that have income tax plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We will update Withholding Calc as further tax rate changes come in.\n\nWithholdingCalc uses an annualized method for computing taxes for most jurisdictions. This means that the total tax withholding that it computes may be slightly different from what your employer computes. Generally the two numbers will agree to within a few cents. If they don't, please use our contact form to let us know and we'll investigate it!\n\nWith the updates some of the 2018 tax brackets now in place, we'll be adding in some of the features we've been working on, like the option to compute your pay check based on an hourly pay rate (with or without overtime pay), calculations for places where there are local taxes as well as state taxes, and more accurate options for states like Arizona which use flat percentage options for withholding instead of a withholding allowance amount.\n\nThe 2018 IRS tax brackets aren't available yet, but we'll be adding them as soon as they are.\n\nWithholdingCalc is not endorsed by any taxing authority, including the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service (They want you to give them too much money :) )."

While it is good to manage perfectly all things in the real world, it is still difficult for the system to automatically do that. As such, people have to directly and manually manage and adjust it.\n\nThat is why people think that maintaining a housekeeping book is very difficult and cumbersome. We made this for such users.\nDo not think that complex functions are difficult. Gradually start maintaining a housekeeping book with Weple Money. We can also do it.

      "label": "The finance app for Total Returns (includes dividends and interest) on over 10,000 global stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, with history from 1980. Provides income, price charts as well as numerical output. Built with data collaboration from EODHistoricalData.com \n\nThe app is specifically built to bring out Total Returns that include dividends or bond interest, exclusion of which can cause ranking inversion and under-allocation to low volatility assets.\n\n#*# After tapping in a ticker or tickers, pls. hit 'return' *not* Swipe. Then Swipe between screens.\n\n#*# Share charts using the iPhone Screen Capture method to post online\n\n***Use the App to find ETFs, stocks and funds that have high Dividend yields. Web charts flatline such charts, since they are price only.\n\n***A simple way to find your ticker syntax is to look it up via EODHistoricalData.com {U.S. listed tickers do not require .US extension, eg MSFT and MSFT.us are both OK; SAP.xetra, 6752.tse for Panasonic, DJI.indx for Dow Jones index etc.}\n\n-Backtest your portfolio on the fly (stress testing) with total returns that include dividends / bond interest. See how your stocks would do say from 1/2007-3/2009 or 1/2020-3/2020\n\n-Designed by a Finance professor and a development team from Canada, Germany and Switzerland, this app has had thousands of downloads since 2012 (free for my students), pls. see cloudEpsilon.com or CorrectCharts.com for the idea, research and examples.\n\n-The problem being rectified by the App has also been written up in the WSJ (Jul 2011). \n\n-No tables, numbers, dividends, interest, splits or distributions to download -  enter the ticker, the Start and End dates, swipe. Done! Allows comparison of up to 8 tickers, at a time. \n\n-Total Returns are useful for calculating income tax and investment taxes too.  The App also lets you compare a security with itself so you instantly see the return differential. Touch the radio button on the output screen for 'price only' returns.\n-\"App is unique and useful but needs an iOS13 update.\" ~ 2020\n-Some user requests for the iOS8 upgrade, 2015: \n\" Yes, I’m in finance. It’s an incredibly useful tool to be able to chart it this way. Thanks!\" Wealth manager from Texas.\n\"Please, please, please tell me you're going to have a updated version for iOS 8. This is the best app ever.\" CFA from Ohio.\n\"Is the App getting an update to be co playable with iOS8? It's such a useful app!\" Football Quarterback.\n\"This helps me build my portfolio and review investments: total return vs. yield vs. capital gains compared between investments and also combined into a portfolio.\"\n\"Thank you... As I said, I really like it and have not found an alternative.\" MIT alum.\n\n-Google_Finance, Bloomberg web and [Yahoo ] stock charts do not include dividends in total return or comparative return charts. \n\n-You can input multiple securities at the same time to see cumulative return charts and associated return numbers. You have the option to see charts inclusive or exclusive of dividends and interest (Total return or Price return).  Just three screens and a few taps. Done!  \n\n-The App has been downloaded in USA, Australia, Switzerland, France, Finland, Sweden, Taiwan, Mexico, Thailand, UK, China, Turkey, Israel, Portugal, Japan, India, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand).\n\nThanks and please leave a review on the App store, we have no marketing.\n\nhttp://cloudepsilon.com\n\nPlease note:\n• A one time payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Data licensing restricts us from offering a free trial period\n\nTOS: http://correctcharts.com/returnfinder/img/disclaimer_returnfinder.pdf\nEULA: \nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy: http://correctcharts.com/returnfinder/img/privacy_policy_returnfinder.pdf"

      "label": "This app was designed to aid you to determine how much debt you could afford compared to your existing income. This app will tell you the ratio between your current income and  debt.\n\nWhat is a debt-to-income ratio?\n\nDebt to income ratio (DTI) is the amount of your total monthly bills divided by how much money you make a month. It allows lenders to determine the likelihood that you would be able to repay a loan.\n\nFor instance, if you pay $2,000 a month for a mortgage, $300 a month for an auto loan and $700 a month for the rest of your bills, you have a total monthly debt of $3,000.\n\nIf your gross monthly income is $7,000, you divide that into the debt ($3,000 / 7,000) and your debt-to-income ratio is 42.8%.\n\nMost lenders would like your debt-to-income ratio to be under 35%. However, you can receive a qualified mortgage with as high as a 43% debt-to-income ratio.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Board, the household debt service payments and financial obligations as a percentage of disposable personal income was 10.1% in the first quarter of 2017. That is down from the high of 18.1 in December of 2009.\n\nThe ratio is best figured on a monthly basis. For example, if your monthly take-home pay is $2,000 and you pay $400 per month in debt payment for loans and credit cards, your debt-to-income ratio is 20 percent ($400 divided by $2,000 = .20).\n\nPut another way, the ratio is a percent of your income that is pre-promised to debt payments. If your ratio is 40%, that means you have pre-promised 40% of your future income to pay debts.\n\nWhy Debt-To-Income Ratio % Matters\n\nWhile there is no law establishing a definitive debt-to-income ratio that requires lenders to make a loan, there are some accepted standards, especially as it regard federal home loans.\n\nFor example, if you qualify for a VA loan, the department of Veteran Affairs guidelines suggest a 41% debt-to-income ratio. FHA loans will allow for a ratio of 43%. It is possible to get a VA or FHA loan with a higher ratio, but only when there compensating factors.\n\nThe ratio needed for conventional loans varies, depending on the lending institution. Most banks rely on the 43% figure for debt-to-income, but it could be as high as 50%, depending on factors like income and credit card debt. Larger lenders, with large assets, are more likely to accept consumers with a high income-to-debt ratio, but only if they have a personal relationship with the customer or believe there is enough income to cover all debts.\n\nRemember, evidence shows that the higher the ratio, the more likely the borrower is going to have problems paying."

      "label": "Taxes App is a simple but powerful United States income tax projection software intended to help you project your Federal and State income tax liability.  Taxes App helps you to figure out the correct amount of Federal and State taxes to withhold from your paycheck.  If you are self-employed, it helps you to figure out estimated taxes.  If you are employed, self-employed, have investment income, etc., it helps figure out income taxes for that too!\n\nTaxes App is great for any Do-It-Yourself type of person and is also great for professionals assisting clients.  Taxes App gives you the ability to run income tax projections in seconds.  It’s also great if you want to learn more about different types of income, deductions, & tax credits and how those affect your tax bill.\n\nIncludes Tax Years 2023, 2022, & 2021.\n\nNote - States are slow to update their tax brackets.  If current-year state brackets are unavailable, prior-year brackets will be used until the state issues current-year brackets.\n\nFederal calculations include:\n- Ordinary federal income tax.\n- Self-employment tax.\n- Self-employment tax deduction. \n- Additional Medicare (Self-employment only).\n- Qualified business income deduction with threshold & phaseout.\n- Net investment income tax.\n- Child tax credit with phase-out.\n- Standard deduction.\n- Ability to manually add for-agi deductions.\n- Ability to manually add other tax credits.\n- Ability to manually add other taxes.\n- Ability to run withholding/estimated tax payments projections.\n\nState calculations include:\n- Ordinary state income tax.\n- Self-Employment Tax Deduction add-back - PA.\n- Standard deduction, personal exemption, dependent exemption (does not include phaseout, but a few states do not calculate these based on a low-income phaseout).\n- Federal QBI Deduction - CO, ID, & ND.\n- Federal 50% QBI Deduction - IA.\n- Federal Income Tax Deduction - IA.\n- Ability to manually add state deductions & state additions.\n- Ability to manually add other tax credits.\n- Ability to manually add other taxes.\n- Ability to run withholding/estimated tax payments projections.\n- Taxes App on most states calculates tax on state taxable income at ordinary state tax rates. This should overestimate taxes due if your state has favorable rates on certain types of income.\n\nTaxes App is brought to you by Adam Myrick, CPA, a solo developer.  If Taxes App is helping you and making your life easier, please consider supporting me by leaving a positive review or updating an existing one.  I’d appreciate it!"

Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

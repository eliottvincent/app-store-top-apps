Rows can be expanded to show your estimated lifetime net income for every life expectancy age. The lifetime net income rows can be tapped to highlight the corresponding cell in the Spreadsheet.\n\n• Spreadsheet -  detailed spreadsheet format showing your estimated lifetime net income for all Social Security starting ages and life expectancy ages. Each lifetime net income cell can be tapped to show more detailed information. The differences in lifetime net income amounts can be easily examined for all benefit starting ages.\n\n• Graph - calculation results displayed as lines depicting estimated lifetime net income for each Social Security starting age. Clearly illustrates the differences in lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages. Any starting age line can be toggled on or off. Tapping a point on the graph will display more detailed information. Supports zooming to show increased granularity.\n\n[ Disclaimer ]\n\nWe have carefully followed the benefit rules from the Social Security Administration and have tested to ensure that our calculations are as accurate as possible.

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

Professional! Highly Recommended... finally the currency application I have been waiting for so long...\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"...I tried all other similar apps, and I am proud to announce that this app is simply the best of them all..\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Smart, intuitive and flexible!... slick interface with great functionality which further impresses with its great selection of currencies and immediate updates. Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming.

      "label": "This app was designed to aid you to determine how much debt you could afford compared to your existing income. This app will tell you the ratio between your current income and  debt.\n\nWhat is a debt-to-income ratio?\n\nDebt to income ratio (DTI) is the amount of your total monthly bills divided by how much money you make a month. It allows lenders to determine the likelihood that you would be able to repay a loan.\n\nFor instance, if you pay $2,000 a month for a mortgage, $300 a month for an auto loan and $700 a month for the rest of your bills, you have a total monthly debt of $3,000.\n\nIf your gross monthly income is $7,000, you divide that into the debt ($3,000 / 7,000) and your debt-to-income ratio is 42.8%.\n\nMost lenders would like your debt-to-income ratio to be under 35%. However, you can receive a qualified mortgage with as high as a 43% debt-to-income ratio.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Board, the household debt service payments and financial obligations as a percentage of disposable personal income was 10.1% in the first quarter of 2017. That is down from the high of 18.1 in December of 2009.\n\nThe ratio is best figured on a monthly basis. For example, if your monthly take-home pay is $2,000 and you pay $400 per month in debt payment for loans and credit cards, your debt-to-income ratio is 20 percent ($400 divided by $2,000 = .20).\n\nPut another way, the ratio is a percent of your income that is pre-promised to debt payments. If your ratio is 40%, that means you have pre-promised 40% of your future income to pay debts.\n\nWhy Debt-To-Income Ratio % Matters\n\nWhile there is no law establishing a definitive debt-to-income ratio that requires lenders to make a loan, there are some accepted standards, especially as it regard federal home loans.\n\nFor example, if you qualify for a VA loan, the department of Veteran Affairs guidelines suggest a 41% debt-to-income ratio. FHA loans will allow for a ratio of 43%. It is possible to get a VA or FHA loan with a higher ratio, but only when there compensating factors.\n\nThe ratio needed for conventional loans varies, depending on the lending institution. Most banks rely on the 43% figure for debt-to-income, but it could be as high as 50%, depending on factors like income and credit card debt. Larger lenders, with large assets, are more likely to accept consumers with a high income-to-debt ratio, but only if they have a personal relationship with the customer or believe there is enough income to cover all debts.\n\nRemember, evidence shows that the higher the ratio, the more likely the borrower is going to have problems paying."

Steven graduated from a local university, and applied for a local job. He worked really hard at his job, and made an honest living.\n \n However, Steven didn’t know how to manage his spending. Every month he would spend and spend and eventually his income would run out, without saving a dime.\n \n “I want to save more money!” He thought to himself. So he set out to turn his financial life around.\n \n To his luck, he found an app called Spentable. An app that allowed him to use the notification center to quickly add expenses to a predefined category. No typing, just choose a category, input a number, and press enter, all from the notification center.\n \n Steven soon saved up enough money to get himself an Apple Watch, which he used to enter his expenses through the Apple Watch Spentable app. He simply lifted his wrist, and in one single tap, he was in. His phone never left his pocket.\n \n Steven went on to get a car, buy a house and marry the guy of his dreams, all thanks to Spentable.\n \n Get Spentable. Get the love of your life."

      "label": "Have you ever wanted to see how much money you have made on a job at any given time after the job has started? Well now you can with the \"Time to Money\" App! Simply open the App, enter your hourly rate, and tap the Start button when you begin a job and watch your earnings grow per second! You can enter your device into sleep mode, exit the App, or even completely power off your device and whenever you open \"Time to Money\" again, it will update your earnings from the time you tapped the Start button to the current time and continue to calculate each second! On a break? No worries. Just tap the Pause button, and when you are ready to continue the job, tap the Resume button. Finished with a job? Nice work! Tap the End button to end the job and save a log! These logs can be viewed at any moment and contain information about that job. In addition, you can also set a goal that you wish to reach. Your goal can be changed at any time. There is also a \"Time to Money\" App for Apple Watch, where you can watch your earnings grow right on your wrist! And better yet, the Apple Watch version of the App can easily be accessed via a Watch face complication (there are multiple complication styles to choose from). Tap the complication, and see your earnings at a glance from within the App! The Apple Watch version of the App is also linked with the iPhone version of the App, ensuring that if you tap Start on one device, it will begin on the other device as well! When you tap the End button on the Apple Watch version of the App, a log is sent to your Phone. Oh yeah, and one more thing! After tapping the Start or Resume button, you will receive hourly notifications that let you know how much money you have made so far to help motivate you while you work!"

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key Universal' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nThis universal version works with both iPhone and iPad. The iPad version features a full sized (1:1) keypad with TypeTone, a unique audio aid to help guide your finger back to the center of a key. The total (*) key (iPad or iPhone) can be on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine 10Key Univ Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n==== Recent Press ===== \nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category. \n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key for iPad.\" \n================= \n\n\nSpecifications: \n================= \n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine. \n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility. \n● TypeTone - a major innovation to aid accurate key entry using audio feedback (iPad version). \n● Full size (1:1) keyboard (iPad version). \n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history. \n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float \n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use. \n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines \n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style) \n● Comprehensive set of help screens. \n● 4 Orientations: Landscape Left/Right + Portrait (iPad version) \n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region). \n\n\n================ \n\nFAQ's \n\nQ1. What is the difference between this App, 'Adding Machine 10Key Universal', and 'Accountant Universal for iPad' in the App. Store.? \nA1. Both calculators are single-column adding machines or calculators with full-size (1:1) keypads and are optimized for the iPad User Interface. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calc’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works. \n\nQ2. Can I touch-type? \nA2. The iPad version comes as close to touch-typing as a touch-screen can be. v2.1 introduces TypeTone. With TypeTone, a key will guide your finger back to the center of a key with an audio tone. \n\nQ3. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape? \nA3. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers, split Add/Sub or Mul/Div groups. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA5. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nAdding Machine features dual keypads with a total (*) key on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n====  Recent Press  =====\nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category for iPad.\n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key Adding Machine app.\"\n=================\n\n\nSpecifications:\n=================\n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine.\n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility.\n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history (full version)\n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float\n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use.\n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines\n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style)\n● Comprehensive set of help screens.\n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region).\n\n \n================\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calculator’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.â¨â¨They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".â¨â¨ Great product. Thanks.\""

If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

Simply open the App, enter your hourly rate, and tap the Start button when you begin a job and watch your earnings grow per second! You can enter your device into sleep mode, exit the App, or even completely power off your device and whenever you open \"Time to Money\" again, it will update your earnings from the time you tapped the Start button to the current time and continue to calculate each second! On a break? No worries. Just tap the Pause button, and when you are ready to continue the job, tap the Resume button. Finished with a job? Nice work! Tap the End button to end the job and save a log! These logs can be viewed at any moment and contain information about that job. In addition, you can also set a goal that you wish to reach. Your goal can be changed at any time. There is also a \"Time to Money\" App for Apple Watch, where you can watch your earnings grow right on your wrist! And better yet, the Apple Watch version of the App can easily be accessed via a Watch face complication (there are multiple complication styles to choose from). Tap the complication, and see your earnings at a glance from within the App! The Apple Watch version of the App is also linked with the iPhone version of the App, ensuring that if you tap Start on one device, it will begin on the other device as well! When you tap the End button on the Apple Watch version of the App, a log is sent to your Phone. Oh yeah, and one more thing! After tapping the Start or Resume button, you will receive hourly notifications that let you know how much money you have made so far to help motivate you while you work!"

      "label": "Debt Strategy helps you identify the best payoff strategy in order to pay down your debts fast. It also helps you track and pay off your debts, and execute on the strategy you choose. After entering your debts in the application, you can analyze how the choice of payment strategy or different extra amounts helps you pay off your debts sooner, and save on the total interest paid.  Debt Strategy supports multiple strategies such as:\n\n- Minimum Payments Only\n- Lowest Balances First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n- Highest Interest Rate First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n\nDebt Strategy helps you to take control of your debts. Pick one debt, either one with the lowest balance or one with the highest interest rate, and focus on paying it off first by paying a little more than the minimum. This will shave months off your debt. With your other debts, continue paying just the minimum. After you finish paying off the first debt, move on to the 2nd debt per your strategy. Roll over the amount you paid each month from your first debt to pay off this one. You will pay off the second debt even more quickly. Continue this strategy until all your debts are paid.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Ability to enter debts and track debts.\n- Ability to identify the best pay-off strategy, and perform what-if analysis with different additional amounts and pay-off strategies\n- Graphical view of how the debts will be paid off\n- Pie/Bar charts for debt break down by category, or remaining balance\n- Monthly payment schedule for each debt\n- Ability to enter payments during the life of the loan, and accurately track remaining balances\n- Payment reminders so you can make your payments on time\n- Ability to override the home currency\n- Option to email a report\n- Password protection"

However, iAllowance is a powerful family finance management system, allowing you to set up scheduled payouts, deduct expenditures, and show category totals - even search for a specific transaction!\n\nSUPPORT FOR MULTIPLE CHILDREN\nYou can setup iAllowance to track the finances for all your kids, each with a separate photo for easy identification and as many banks as you desire.\n\nUNLIMITED NUMBER OF BANKS\nKids are very busy these days. From general spending money to clothing allowances, gas money to cell phones accounts, kids and parents have a lot to keep track of in today's world. With iAllowance, you can create an unlimited number of banks for each of your kids. Each bank has its own transaction list where you can add, edit and delete transactions as often as you need to.\n\nIf you don't want to use real money, you can setup any bank to use stars or even time. Mix and match star, time and real money banks to make iAllowance work best for you. Furthermore, you can assign an optional interest rate to any of the banks to help teach your children the value of saving money over the long term.\n\nAUTOMATIC ALLOWANCES\nLet iAllowance do the remembering for you!  It's easy to set up any number of allowances that will pay out automatically at repeating intervals. Each allowance can be set up to pay into one or more of the child's banks. There is no need to setup a single allowance for each bank.\n\nCHORES\nTrack all your children's chores with iAllowance. Get your kids involved in the process and watch the chores get done! Use the reminders to push alerts to your kids - even if iAllowance is not running.\n\nREWARDS\nKids are more motivated when they have goals to work towards. You can setup rewards that you can choose to 'cash in' when you child reaches the set goal.\n\nPARENTAL CONTROLS\nWe feel that it's important to get your kids involved in managing their own finances, but it is also important that you have a choice as to whether or not they can edit the information. By turning on the built-in parental controls, you can restrict your kids to a view only mode while you maintain full editorial control for yourself.\n\nINSTANT SYNC\nYou can instantly sync your data between devices using your free iAllowance account. All your data is backed up on your iAllowance account automatically. There is no need to worry about losing your data.\n\nWe are certain that iAllowance will meet all your family finance needs. So, make the leap with Jump Gap Software's iAllowance."

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nAdding Machine features dual keypads with a total (*) key on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooksÂ©, DropboxÂ©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n====  Recent Press  =====\nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category for iPad.\n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key Adding Machine app.\"\n=================\n\n\nSpecifications:\n=================\nâ Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine.\nâ Export a PDF file to iBooksÂ©, DropBoxÂ©, Email, or your favorite printing utility.\nâ Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\nâ 400 lines of paper tape history (full version)\nâ 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float\nâ Save paper tapes to disk for later use.\nâ Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines\nâ Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\nâ Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style)\nâ Comprehensive set of help screens.\nâ International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region).\n\n \n================\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while âAccountant Calculatorâ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, â, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

Sometimes we need help...and that's where this app comes into the picture.\n\nThe Defer My Pay app effortlessly guides you through 3 simple questions (while _never_ asking for, or collecting, personally identifiable information) and then instantly presents you with a customized deferred payment plan that works for both the debtor and the creditor (i.e. the one paying and the one collecting). You can even move back and forth through the questions and adjust as needed. This allows the people on both sides of the transaction get to keep the roof over their heads and food on their tables. It's a win-win.\n\nWe're in this together.\nEverything will be OK.\nLet's work something out."

Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. Itâs beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

While it is good to manage perfectly all things in the real world, it is still difficult for the system to automatically do that. As such, people have to directly and manually manage and adjust it.\n\nThat is why people think that maintaining a housekeeping book is very difficult and cumbersome. We made this for such users.\nDo not think that complex functions are difficult. Gradually start maintaining a housekeeping book with Weple Money. We can also do it.

      "label": "Bank Card Checker tells you the Bank or Financial Institution that issued any given credit/debit card by checking its huge internal database. Additionally it validates the card number.\n\nDo you run a shop or office where you need to take orders that are paid for by credit card over the phone? Need to check that the card information a customer is giving you is valid? With Bank Card Checker you can be sure that a card number is valid and perform extra checks on the card such as the Bank or financial institution that issued it, what country it was issued in, whether it is a company/corporate or personal card and whether it's a credit/debit/visa/mastercard etc.\n\nThis incredibly easy to use application lets you view Credit or Debit Card Issuer data on your iPhone as well as validating the card number. The App interrogates its internal database of Card Issuer data to tell you the name of the bank or financial institution, the country the card was issued in, whether the card is a consumer or corporate account and the scheme type (VISA Credit, VISA Debit, Mastercard Credit, Maestro etc) .\n\nThe App can determine Card Issuer data from just the first 9 digits of the card number. In order to check that the number is valid then the whole number must be entered. \n\nThe internal database has hundreds of thousands of banks/financial institutions records in it ensuring that more than 99% of the worlds organisations are covered. The App will be updated regularly to ensure that the database stays up to date.\n\nThe App does not store any entered card data and does not connect to the internet to obtain issuer data.\n\nNOTE: The App does not check card expiry dates. This data is not publicly available."

Rows can be expanded to show your estimated lifetime net income for every life expectancy age. The lifetime net income rows can be tapped to highlight the corresponding cell in the Spreadsheet.\n\nâ¢ Spreadsheet -  detailed spreadsheet format showing your estimated lifetime net income for all Social Security starting ages and life expectancy ages. Each lifetime net income cell can be tapped to show more detailed information. The differences in lifetime net income amounts can be easily examined for all benefit starting ages.\n\nâ¢ Graph - calculation results displayed as lines depicting estimated lifetime net income for each Social Security starting age. Clearly illustrates the differences in lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages. Any starting age line can be toggled on or off. Tapping a point on the graph will display more detailed information.

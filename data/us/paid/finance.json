      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key Universal' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nThis universal version works with both iPhone and iPad. The iPad version features a full sized (1:1) keypad with TypeTone, a unique audio aid to help guide your finger back to the center of a key. The total (*) key (iPad or iPhone) can be on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine 10Key Univ Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n==== Recent Press ===== \nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category. \n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key for iPad.\" \n================= \n\n\nSpecifications: \n================= \n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine. \n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility. \n● TypeTone - a major innovation to aid accurate key entry using audio feedback (iPad version). \n● Full size (1:1) keyboard (iPad version). \n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history. \n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float \n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use. \n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines \n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style) \n● Comprehensive set of help screens. \n● 4 Orientations: Landscape Left/Right + Portrait (iPad version) \n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region). \n\n\n================ \n\nFAQ's \n\nQ1. What is the difference between this App, 'Adding Machine 10Key Universal', and 'Accountant Universal for iPad' in the App. Store.? \nA1. Both calculators are single-column adding machines or calculators with full-size (1:1) keypads and are optimized for the iPad User Interface. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calc’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works. \n\nQ2. Can I touch-type? \nA2. The iPad version comes as close to touch-typing as a touch-screen can be. v2.1 introduces TypeTone. With TypeTone, a key will guide your finger back to the center of a key with an audio tone. \n\nQ3. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape? \nA3. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers, split Add/Sub or Mul/Div groups. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA5. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "What is the best age to start your Social Security benefits? What if you start at 62 with reduced benefits, but invest and get compound interest? Or is it a good idea for you to wait until 70 for increased benefits?\n\nThe Social Security Calculator is a powerful estimating tool that can answer these questions and help you plan for retirement.\n\n[ Features ]\n\n• Estimates the most profitable starting age for your benefits based on your income and life expectancy\n\n• Calculates your potential lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages so you can easily compare the results\n\n• Your date of birth and benefit amount at full retirement age are all you need to know (benefits at FRA can be found on your Social Security statement or by creating an account on SSA.gov)\n\n• Optionally include other monthly income, an interest rate for income, monthly expenses, and an interest rate for expenses\n\n• Optionally disable paying down expenses (potentially useful in situations when compounding income exceeds compounding expenses)\n\n• Detailed results are presented in interactive Summary, Spreadsheet, and Graph formats\n\n• Calculation inputs can be labeled and saved for quick retrieval and comparison\n\n• Robust in-app help via information buttons, getting started guide, glossary, and links to additional resources\n\n[ Interactive Results ]\n\n• Summary - a table of life expectancy ages with their most profitable starting ages for benefits. Rows can be expanded to show your estimated lifetime net income for every life expectancy age. The lifetime net income rows can be tapped to highlight the corresponding cell in the Spreadsheet.\n\n• Spreadsheet -  detailed spreadsheet format showing your estimated lifetime net income for all Social Security starting ages and life expectancy ages. Each lifetime net income cell can be tapped to show more detailed information. The differences in lifetime net income amounts can be easily examined for all benefit starting ages.\n\n• Graph - calculation results displayed as lines depicting estimated lifetime net income for each Social Security starting age. Clearly illustrates the differences in lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages. Any starting age line can be toggled on or off. Tapping a point on the graph will display more detailed information. Supports zooming to show increased granularity.\n\n[ Disclaimer ]\n\nWe have carefully followed the benefit rules from the Social Security Administration and have tested to ensure that our calculations are as accurate as possible.  However, since we are not affiliated with the SSA, this app is only intended to be used for reference.

      "label": "Follow us on Twitter at @CashflowsApp!\n\nCashflows Pro helps you forecast future balances of your bank accounts. It's simple to set up and requires minimal effort to maintain.\n\nTell it about your recurring transactions (including transfers between accounts) and future one-time transactions, and let it estimate your account balances months (or years) into the future.\n\nIt's not interested in the past, so there's no need to enter or maintain your transaction history.\n\nIt shows your account transactions and balances over time and lets you override individual payment dates and amounts. Quickly toggle payments on and off to see how they impact your future balances. The graph updates immediately with any changes you make.\n\nUpdate the starting balance occasionally, and it'll show you which transactions are still due. If any have already occurred (or are late) just tap & hold to toggle them on or off.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Multiple accounts: Add multiple accounts and set up recurring or manual transfers between them.\n- Recurring transactions: Supports recurring transactions with start date, end date (optional) and many recurrence options.\n- Warning balance: Set a warning balance for an account and see at a glance when your balance is below it.\n- Interactive forecast graph: Shows your future balance over time, highlighting warning balance and negative regions; tap the graph for a closer look at the nearby transactions.\n- File-based: Keep multiple scenarios in separate files. Open backup files from Cashflows or Total Cashflow.\n\nMANY USES:\n\n* Planning Future Purchases:\n\nThis is a great tool for forecasting payments for a future loan, mortgage or car lease. Create a recurring transaction for the payment amount, fill in the first and last payment dates and see how it affects your balance. Make adjustments to figure out what you can afford.\n\n* Planning for Change:\n\nYou might have a recurring bill that increases annually (such as health insurance). Simply create another recurring transaction to represent the increased payment and set its start date appropriately, and adjust the end date of the original transaction. You'll immediately see how it affects your finances in the future.\n\n* Planning for Uncertainty:\n\nThe forecasts are only as accurate as you need them to be. If you plan to pay a minimum amount per month onto your credit card, set that up as a recurring transaction. Once you decide how much you want to pay this month, just override the forecast amount. You can always edit or delete the override later.\n\n* Getting Out of Debt:\n\nThis app can help you get out of debt, and figure out how long it will take. Enter a recurring transaction between your checking / current and loan / credit account for the minimum amount you intend to pay each month. Extend the forecast period (tap \"More\" at the bottom of the Forecast page) and then look at the Balance Graphs for your accounts. If you can afford to pay extra in a few months, override that month's payment (or create a one-time transaction for the additional amount). You'll instantly see the effect on your checking / current balance, loan balance and when the loan will be repaid."

      "label": "No ADs or In-App Purchases. \n\nFor any issues please contact us at DIYIMPLEMENTER@GMAIL.COM\n\nThis Intrinsic Value Calculator is based on Warren Buffett \"Ten Cap Price\" otherwise known as \"Owner Earnings\" calculation. Buffett is calling Owner Earnings: \"the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses.\" \n\nPer Warren Buffett Value Investment Theory the buy decision should be based on several factors: \n\n1. Company must have competitive advantage... \n2. Company performed admirably in the past 10 years, recovered after market correction(s) and recession(s)... \n3. Company must have long term prospects - be relevant in 10 years from now... \n4. Company's market price should be 20-30% less than calculated intrinsic value - margin of safety price. \n\nThe logical question you would ask is how is it possible for such a good company to have the market price 20-30% bellow intrinsic value? The answer is: YES it's possible due to various reasons. The potential reasons could include: bad news about the company, company's industry is out of market favor, market is in correction or recession... \n\nWarren Buffett indicator -> the historical ratio of Total Market Cap over GDP is currently at 195%. Meaning we are in the biggest Stock Market BUBBLE in the history of the world!!! \n\nThis is undeniable proof that we are in the Market Bubble that is bigger than \"DOT-COM Bubble\" of 2001 or \"Housing Bubble\" of 2008. It's just a matter of time before this Market Bubble will inevitably POP presenting an opportunity for Value Investors to buy their favorite stocks for less than intrinsic value! But in order to buy your favorite stocks for less than intrinsic value you need to know what this intrinsic value is.  This is when our Intrinsic Value Calculator comes handy. You can calculate, store, reload and compare intrinsic value with market price anywhere and anytime, and all you need is your phone and our application.\n\nYou can read more about Value Investing online. We would recommend - \"The Intelligent Investor\" book written by Benjamin Graham - Warren Buffett's teacher and the founder of Value Investment Theory.\n\nThe goal of this application is to help value investors with calculation of intrinsic value. Most of the values required for calculation could be found on company's latest annual report. Annual reports can be found on company's website in investor relations section. Values missing in annual report could be found on GOOGLE. \n\nEach edit field has a corresponding help button to explain the meaning and location of the data on company's annual report.\n\n\"Examples\" button would display actual values for Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Alibaba, Baidu and all FAANG stocks: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet’s Google. Based on the calculated intrinsic values representing the real value of these stocks we can conclude this Stock Market BUBBLE would be called \"FAANG Bubble\".\n\n\"Save Data\" button would save data to your phone storage at \"IntrinsicValueData\" folder as comma separated \".CSV\" file.\n\n\"Load Saved Data\" button would display list of files \".CSV\" saved at \"IntrinsicValueData\" folder. \n\n\".CSV\" files in \"IntrinsicValueData\" folder could be copied to PC and loaded to MS Excel for further analyses. \n\nYou can use this calculator literally anywhere, after all, it comes with your phone… It’s easy to use, all you need is to find and load annual report to your phone using internet browser as PDF file, search for required values, cut and paste values to the calculator and press Calculate button. Now you know if the stock is the bargain or overvalued based on company’s annual report and not on subjective opinion of various market analysts who could be biased based on their own long or short position on particular stock…\n\nThis method doesn’t take growth into account. \n\nIf you like the app we would really appreciate your positive review.\n\n© 2022 Best Implementer LLC"

      "label": "Have you ever wondered what your money could be worth in 30 years if you saved it instead of spent it? Compound Interest answers that question by helping you calculate what your money could be worth if you saved it or invested it over time.\n\nImagine you started saving for retirement when you're just 15 instead of 40. Put away $100 bucks a week with 7% returns. By the time you hit retirement age you'd have over 2 million dollars stashed away. You might ask yourself: how, doing the quick math that's only saving $260,000? Well, that is where compound interest comes into play. Even though you only earned and saved a little over $250,000 you gained over $2,000,000 in compound interest. Pretty cool right?\n\nAlready have an end goal in mind? Instead solve for contribution amount, return rate, or length. Want to retire with $5,000,000 but aren't sure how much you need to be saving each month to reach that goal? Switch the mode to solve for contribution amount and it will automatically calculate that number.\n\nSo check out this awesome compound interest calculator that lets you see your gains broken up by year with a cool interactive graph, multiple tabs, and light/dark themes.\n\nNotable Features:\n- The ability to create additional tabs to allow you to calculate as many sets of data and outputs as you want.\n- Ability to solve for different values like total amount, length, contribution amount, or the return rate you might need to achieve your goals.\n- Tab References: You can now reference one tab's total balance in another's initial balance. This is great for scenarios where you want to change the contribution amount or return rate in future years. For example, you can now experiment with the scenario of contributing $500 for 10 years followed by $0 for the next 10 years, and see the effects of compound interest over a 20 year time period. To reference another tab just tap into the starting balance and you'll see a toolbar above the keyboard with tabs that can be referenced.\n- See data broken out by each year it's being compounded."

Unlike a physical check book you can easily add an omitted transaction or change the amount for a transaction, and the app will recalculate your balances.\nYou can change the order of  transactions.  \nYou can indicate whether transactions have cleared or not.  \nThe app provides you with two balances – your available balance and your cleared balance.  Your cleared balance should match your bank account balance.  \nYou can also input repeat transactions by indicating the amount and frequency and the app will create the subsequent transactions for you.\nYou can track as many accounts as you like.\nYou can indicate budget categories for each transaction and the app will give you a month-to-date summary of your spending by category.\nThe app comes with preset categories, and you can add additional categories or delete categories.\nFlexibility is key in this app.\nIt’s a simple and effective way to track your financial accounts, and will make budgeting and reconciliation with your bank statements much easier."

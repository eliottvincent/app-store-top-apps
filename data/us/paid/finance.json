With iAllowance, you can create an unlimited number of banks for each of your kids.

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.â¨â¨They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".â¨â¨ Great product. Thanks.\""

Calculate, comment and correct instantly.\n\nWhat happens if you combine a standard calculator App, a classic desktop calculator and a note App ?\n\nCalcTape brings you the best of these and even more.\nIt is your companion for all daily calculation needs and easily masters all scenarios you can imagine.\nCalcTape is NOT a scientific calculator app, but do we need these in daily use ?\n\nEver did a long calculation with many figures and asked yourself:\n\"Did I enter the last figure correctly ?\"\n\"The result looks strange somehow !\"\nWith CalcTape you keep an overview, can check all figures and correct figures instantly inplace with\nall subsequent results being adjusted automatically ! \nMissed a figure ? No problem: Just insert it in the right place easily by entering a new line.\n\nYou can place the cursor everywhere you like in the calculation: It's like a note where\nyou can change anything you like in any place with the advantage, that changing numbers\nor operators updates your calculation immediately!\n\nCalcTape can be considered an \"Excel Lite with a calculator interface\".\n\nYou can also keep the calculation for your records (documents) and create templates: \nReplacing the figures in your template and getting the correct results is a breeze.\nCommenting figures and results gives sense to your calculations, so you can understand\nwhat you did when viewing the calculation a month later.\nCustomize CalcTape to your needs and place only those buttons on your keypad that you really\nneed everyday. Create your own functions to e.g. add a specific percent rate with a tap on\na single button.\n\nCalcTape features:\n- Save your calculations into files\n- Create own functions or text snippets to be entered when pressing a button (long press a button to enter the Button screen)\n- Create own keypad layouts (change assignment of all buttons except numbers and backspace / change button sizes)\n- Select between different keypad layouts (the \"function keypad\" contains no numbers and is nearly completely customizable)\n   to get more buttons or other functions, 2 keypads are directly accessible in the main screen\n- Share your calculations using standard iOS sharing capabilities, e.g. email\n- Sync your calculations with iPhone, iPad, Mac and PC using iCloud Drive.\n- Calculate TAX, VAT and other percent values easily\n- Use CalcTape for budget, accounting and expense tracking in the office and at home, everyday.\n\nCalcTape, more than a calculator.\n\n\nFAQ:\n- Start a new calculation on the same sheet by simply tapping the \"=\" key twice.\n- Do a long tap on a button to assign another existing function or to create a user function for it.\n- If you accidentally hit \"AC\" you can use \"Undo\" to get your calculation back."

The Treasury provides daily updates on-line lagged by 24 hours and the app retrieves the update spreadsheet for the past 200 days when it is connected to the Internet. \n\nAdditionally, you may plot the yield curve and get an estimate of the yield for all months from 1 to 360 (1 month to 30 years) by means of a slider.\n\nThe estimated yields are computed by linear interpolation between the actual yields.

This easy-to-use app helps you eliminate debt using the âdebt snowballâ method that is taught and endorsed by many financial professionals. \n\nFeatured in Parade Magazine's Intelligence Report. (April 2012)\n\nFeatured in iTunes \"Top 20 apps in 2011 to improve your fitness and finances\"\n\nThe best Debt Snowball app in iTunes\n\nThis app is used and recommended by many financial advisors, firms, and banks.  Simply input your debts (including balance, interest rate, and monthly payment) and Debt Snowball Pro will help you select the best payoff method.\n\nUsing the debt snowball method of payment, once you pay off a debt, youâll apply the previous payment to the next debt, resulting in a snowball effect as the amount paid toward your larger loans grows over time.\n\nYou can choose to pay off debts with higher interest rates first (to save money), or those with the lowest balances (for small, motivating successes along the way). Debt Snowball Pro shows you just how much money youâll save by choosing these methods over making minimum payments.\n\nView our demonstration on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ4Ce7ujDxc\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\nâ¢Easy-to-use interface.\nâ¢Password protection.\nâ¢Ability to add and remove debts, update balances, and see when you will be debt-free.\nâ¢Shows interest saved and debt payoff dates.\nâ¢Detailed Payment Schedule spreadsheet, showing effects of applying snowball payments to individual debts.\nâ¢Ability to quickly make payments on individual loans.\nâ¢iCloud support so you can easily share data between devices.\nâ¢Progress bars to show and encourage progress.\nâ¢Custom notification to remind you when each bill is due.\nâ¢Ability to share on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nNOTE:\nThis also makes a great gift to family and friends.  Click the down arrow on the left (next to Buy App) and choose \"Gift This App\".\n\nCOMMENTS:\nPlease send your comments, suggestions, and questions to matt.l.king@comcast.net.\n\nREVIEWS:\n\"This is an excellent App! One of the most important keys to success when trying to get out of debt is âConcentrationâ on the goal.  The Debt Snowball is a goal. Having the information readily available to look at may keep more people motivated towards attaining their goal of becoming debt free.\"\n- enemyofdebt.com\n\n\"My husband and I both use Debt Snowball Pro.  The peace of mind that I got from having a plan set and seeing the \"end date goal\" is worth every penny.  Before using Debt Snowball there was a constant nagging feeling in the back of my head that kept me from ever being completely relaxed.  Now, with the goal in site I feel so much better about our situation.  If you have several loans you should not hesitate, get the app.  Follow the steps and get your own peace of mind and start working toward freedom from debt\"\n- AquababeJen\n\n\"Great app to manage and control your debts.  Simple to use and understand and can save you a ton of real money\"\n-casey_tx\n\nIf you like this app you will also like our other apps:\nMortgage Calculator +\nLoan Calculator - What if?\nRandom Fun Facts\nScripture of the Day - (NASB Version)\nToday in American History\nRandom Crazy Illusions\nTravel Bingo & Blackout\nGrocery Bingo\nBizarre Holidays"

Therefore, one should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing.

Interest-only mortgages loans are also supported.\n\nYou can pay off your mortgage early with extra payments. Add one-off, monthly and annual extra payments.

The calculator supports Canadian mortgages along with UK annual rest mortgages.\n\nMultiple rounding options on loan calculations are also available.

      "label": "This app was designed to aid you to determine how much debt you could afford compared to your existing income. This app will tell you the ratio between your current income and  debt.\n\nWhat is a debt-to-income ratio?\n\nDebt to income ratio (DTI) is the amount of your total monthly bills divided by how much money you make a month. It allows lenders to determine the likelihood that you would be able to repay a loan.\n\nFor instance, if you pay $2,000 a month for a mortgage, $300 a month for an auto loan and $700 a month for the rest of your bills, you have a total monthly debt of $3,000.\n\nIf your gross monthly income is $7,000, you divide that into the debt ($3,000 / 7,000) and your debt-to-income ratio is 42.8%.\n\nMost lenders would like your debt-to-income ratio to be under 35%. However, you can receive a qualified mortgage with as high as a 43% debt-to-income ratio.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Board, the household debt service payments and financial obligations as a percentage of disposable personal income was 10.1% in the first quarter of 2017. That is down from the high of 18.1 in December of 2009.\n\nThe ratio is best figured on a monthly basis. For example, if your monthly take-home pay is $2,000 and you pay $400 per month in debt payment for loans and credit cards, your debt-to-income ratio is 20 percent ($400 divided by $2,000 = .20).\n\nPut another way, the ratio is a percent of your income that is pre-promised to debt payments. If your ratio is 40%, that means you have pre-promised 40% of your future income to pay debts.\n\nWhy Debt-To-Income Ratio % Matters\n\nWhile there is no law establishing a definitive debt-to-income ratio that requires lenders to make a loan, there are some accepted standards, especially as it regard federal home loans.\n\nFor example, if you qualify for a VA loan, the department of Veteran Affairs guidelines suggest a 41% debt-to-income ratio. FHA loans will allow for a ratio of 43%. It is possible to get a VA or FHA loan with a higher ratio, but only when there compensating factors.\n\nThe ratio needed for conventional loans varies, depending on the lending institution. Most banks rely on the 43% figure for debt-to-income, but it could be as high as 50%, depending on factors like income and credit card debt. Larger lenders, with large assets, are more likely to accept consumers with a high income-to-debt ratio, but only if they have a personal relationship with the customer or believe there is enough income to cover all debts.\n\nRemember, evidence shows that the higher the ratio, the more likely the borrower is going to have problems paying."

      "label": "Whether you want to use the debt snowball method, a debt avalanche, or pay off debt in any order at all, the award-winning app Pay Off Debt by Jackie Beck can help keep you motivated and moving to debt freedom. \n\nOver 53,000 users canât be wrong.\n\nAs Susanebw said, âThis app is so simple to use and very flexible. But the greatest thing is when I realized with the snowball method, I can be debt free in two years!â\n\nIf youâre tired of money fights, working for the credit cards, and stressing out over expenses, Pay Off Debt can help you knock out your debts and change your life.\n\nYou can go from uncertainty, stress, and worry to doing the things YOU want to do. Guilt free. I know, because my husband and I paid off over $147,000 and are now completely debt free. You can do the things that matter to you too.\n\nâ¶ ABOUT PAY OFF DEBT:\n\nItâs different from the others -- not just because it's been around since 2009 and reached the #1 Financial app multiple times. \n\nIt's different because you don't JUST get the app. You also get someone who is on your side; someone who wants to see you succeed and reach the FREEDOM that awaits. I have helpful articles at JackieBeck.com, offer free email tips, and reply to your questions and comments.\n\nI don't bombard you with ads or try to sell you loans or credit scores in the guise of helping the way some do.\n\nâ¶ WHAT OTHERS SAY ABOUT THE APP:\n\n\"The greatest thing since \"Total Money Make Over\". I absolutely love this app! It helps me stay motivated to keep that snowball rolling! AND instead of trying to come up with the words to explain it to my husband this app did it for me. He is 100% on board with dumping debt now!\" -Steph\n\n\"I just paid off my first debt thanks to this app! I swear being able to watch my % increase and my amount due decrease really helped me stick to the snowball plan. Just mailing monthly checks, and reading the statements isnât as rewarding as this plan. Now paying off my debt feels better than shopping!\" -Berryhappy\n\n\"Unique way of knowing exactly what you owe and how much is left to pay. No other app does this as smooth and perfect as this one. Lots of different features and customer service is great!\" - J_019\n \nâ¶ WITH PAY OFF DEBT YOU CAN:\n\nâ¢ Stay motivated by seeing your planned debt-free date and visualizing your progress.\n\nâ¢ Pay off debts using the order and method that works best for you\n\nâ¢ Compare & contrast how long it'd take to pay off your debt with different scenarios, and find out how much of a difference even a small extra payment might make. (You can make changes at any time.)\n\nâ¢ See exactly how far youâve come by viewing the payment history for each debt.\n\nâ¢ Record payments several ways. For flexibility, you can record payments that are different from the regular minimum payment and record payments frequently.\n\nâ¢ Avoid worry. Pay Off Debt doesnât connect to your accounts or move money around for you. Instead, you do the behaviors that will help you become debt free.\n\nâ¢ Have confidence. Pay Off Debt shows you amortization tables and a summary of your debt as a whole, and lets you make notes. It takes it all into account: interest rates, starting & current balances, your planned monthly payment, payment recorded dates, estimated time left, and even taxes & insurance (escrow) when adding a Mortgage/HELOC type debt.\n\nâ¢ Work together with your spouse and/or an accountability partner. (You can email your info to up to 4 emails and share your debt snowball across devices if youâre using the same Apple ID.)\n\nâ¢ Use additional features, like choosing the currency you want, password protection, etc. See https://www.jackiebeck.com/pay-off-debt-app-info/ for the full list.\n\nâ¶ DOWNLOAD PAY OFF DEBT NOW & HEAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM!\n\n(If you have questions or ideas, please email me at jackie@jackiebeck.com.)"

MathU RPN is based on the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) entry system and combines more than 96 functions to create a calculator that meets the needs of professionals who use a calculator every day.\n\nDr. Clay M. Thompson of Creative Creek has harnessed the computational power of the iPhone to produce an accurate and high performance calculator.\n\nGeneral Features\n- IEEE double precision accuracy (16 digits)\n- High performance fast computations\n- 20 storage registers\n- 5 financial registers\n- 16 high stack (switchable to 4)\n- Supports international number separators\n- Switch between portrait and landscape keypads\n- Quick access to the preference and on-line manual\n- Stack and Register view (accessible via [RCL][RCL]\n\nScientific Features\n- Full set of trigonometric functions\n- Full set of logarithmic and power functions\n- Statistics functions\n- Polar and rectangular conversions\n- Repeated computations\n\nMortgage and Loan Features\n- Time value of Money functions\n- Compute mortgage and loan terms\n- Solve for payments and interest rates\n- Solve for IRR and NPV\n- Date functions\n\nComputer Science Features\n- Number bases (HEX, OCT, DEC, BIN)\n- Bitwise logical operations\n- Masking and shifting functions\n- Support for a wordsizes up to 48 bits\n- Modular arithmetic\n\nMathU RPN 3.2 has been reformatted to work on the iPhone and iPad.  On the iPad, MathU RPN maintains its orientation as the iPad is turned.\n\nMathU RPN 3.2 a great programmer's calculator.  The A-F keys are available right up front for easy entry in HEX mode and there are many functions for working with integers.\n\nMathU RPN 3.2 is also a better financial calculator.  There are new functions for computing mortgage amortization and cash flow computations like IRR and NPV, as well as functions for working with dates.  Many of the existing financial functions have been extended to handle odd periods (conforming to the same conventions as the HP-12C).  In addition, on tall devices (like the iPhone 5 or higher), the financial registers are displayed on the keypad.\n\nThe scientific side of MathU RPN has also been improved by adding functions for linear regression as well as computing the percent of total.\n\nMathU 3.2 supports iOS 9.3 or higher.\n\nFor more info (including the users manual)\ngo to http://www.creativecreek.com or use the built-in quick reference."

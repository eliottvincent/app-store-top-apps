We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.â¨â¨They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".â¨â¨ Great product. Thanks.\""

What is the difference between this App, 'Adding Machine 10Key Universal', and 'Accountant Universal for iPad' in the App. Store.? \nA1. Both calculators are single-column adding machines or calculators with full-size (1:1) keypads and are optimized for the iPad User Interface. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while âAccountant Calcâ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, â, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works. \n\nQ2. Can I touch-type? \nA2. The iPad version comes as close to touch-typing as a touch-screen can be. v2.1 introduces TypeTone. With TypeTone, a key will guide your finger back to the center of a key with an audio tone. \n\nQ3. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape? \nA3. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers, split Add/Sub or Mul/Div groups. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA5. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods.

Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nAdding Machine features dual keypads with a total (*) key on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooksÂ©, DropboxÂ©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n====  Recent Press  =====\nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category for iPad.\n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key Adding Machine app.\"\n=================\n\n\nSpecifications:\n=================\nâ Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine.\nâ Export a PDF file to iBooksÂ©, DropBoxÂ©, Email, or your favorite printing utility.\nâ Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\nâ 400 lines of paper tape history (full version)\nâ 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float\nâ Save paper tapes to disk for later use.\nâ Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines\nâ Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\nâ Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style)\nâ Comprehensive set of help screens.\nâ International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region).\n\n \n================\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while âAccountant Calculatorâ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, â, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

You might ask yourself: how, doing the quick math that's only saving $260,000? Well, that is where compound interest comes into play. Even though you only earned and saved a little over $250,000 you gained over $2,000,000 in compound interest. Pretty cool right?\n\nAlready have an end goal in mind? Instead solve for contribution amount, return rate, or length. Want to retire with $5,000,000 but aren't sure how much you need to be saving each month to reach that goal? Switch the mode to solve for contribution amount and it will automatically calculate that number.\n\nSo check out this awesome compound interest calculator that lets you see your gains broken up by year with a cool interactive graph, multiple tabs, and light/dark themes.\n\nNotable Features:\n- The ability to create additional tabs to allow you to calculate as many sets of data and outputs as you want.\n- Ability to solve for different values like total amount, length, contribution amount, or the return rate you might need to achieve your goals.\n- Tab References: You can now reference one tab's total balance in another's initial balance. This is great for scenarios where you want to change the contribution amount or return rate in future years. For example, you can now experiment with the scenario of contributing $500 for 10 years followed by $0 for the next 10 years, and see the effects of compound interest over a 20 year time period. To reference another tab just tap into the starting balance and you'll see a toolbar above the keyboard with tabs that can be referenced.\n- See data broken out by each year it's being compounded."

From collectible film cameras to '80s vintage shirts to a set of tools, flippers keep products from ending up in landfills while finding them new, loving homes.\n\nWith Margin is a straightforward yet effective profit and loss estimator providing anyone on the go quick access to determine a find as a possible hit or miss. Utilizing fixed or percentage-based costs, quickly enter your reasonably educated guess for the amount it could sell. Next, subtract shipping, item cost, marketplace fees, and payment processing fees (if applicable). If profitable based on your industry knowledge, you can quickly act upon it.\n\nTip: While using the Custom calculator, tap the percent (%) icon to turn the line item value into a percentage rather than a fixed cost; this is useful for percentage-based fees.\n\nThank you for downloading With Margin!"

      "label": "What is the best age to start your Social Security benefits? What if you start at 62 with reduced benefits, but invest and get compound interest? Or is it a good idea for you to wait until 70 for increased benefits?\n\nThe Social Security Calculator is a powerful estimating tool that can answer these questions and help you plan for retirement.\n\n[ Features ]\n\nâ¢ Estimates the most profitable starting age for your benefits based on your income and life expectancy\n\nâ¢ Calculates your potential lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages so you can easily compare the results\n\nâ¢ Your date of birth and benefit amount at full retirement age are all you need to know (benefits at FRA can be found on your Social Security statement or by creating an account on SSA.gov)\n\nâ¢ Optionally include other monthly income, an interest rate for income, monthly expenses, and an interest rate for expenses\n\nâ¢ Optionally disable paying down expenses (potentially useful in situations when compounding income exceeds compounding expenses)\n\nâ¢ Detailed results are presented in interactive Summary, Spreadsheet, and Graph formats\n\nâ¢ Calculation inputs can be labeled and saved for quick retrieval and comparison\n\nâ¢ Robust in-app help via information buttons, getting started guide, glossary, and links to additional resources\n\n[ Interactive Results ]\n\nâ¢ Summary - a table of life expectancy ages with their most profitable starting ages for benefits. Rows can be expanded to show your estimated lifetime net income for every life expectancy age. The lifetime net income rows can be tapped to highlight the corresponding cell in the Spreadsheet.\n\nâ¢ Spreadsheet -  detailed spreadsheet format showing your estimated lifetime net income for all Social Security starting ages and life expectancy ages. Each lifetime net income cell can be tapped to show more detailed information. The differences in lifetime net income amounts can be easily examined for all benefit starting ages.\n\nâ¢ Graph - calculation results displayed as lines depicting estimated lifetime net income for each Social Security starting age. Clearly illustrates the differences in lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages. Any starting age line can be toggled on or off. Tapping a point on the graph will display more detailed information. Supports zooming to show increased granularity.\n\n[ Disclaimer ]\n\nWe have carefully followed the benefit rules from the Social Security Administration and have tested to ensure that our calculations are as accurate as possible.  However, since we are not affiliated with the SSA, this app is only intended to be used for reference.  Before making a retirement decision we strongly recommend reviewing SSA.gov and other resources for more information.

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

Sometimes we need help...and that's where this app comes into the picture.\n\nThe Defer My Pay app effortlessly guides you through 3 simple questions (while _never_ asking for, or collecting, personally identifiable information) and then instantly presents you with a customized deferred payment plan that works for both the debtor and the creditor (i.e. the one paying and the one collecting). You can even move back and forth through the questions and adjust as needed. This allows the people on both sides of the transaction get to keep the roof over their heads and food on their tables. It's a win-win.\n\nWe're in this together.\nEverything will be OK.\nLet's work something out."

Do you need to put more money into your 401k each year?\n\nThis Easy Retirement Calculator keeps it simple for easy high-level planning and comparing different scenarios.  (How much more would you have at retirement if you increase your savings, or if your investments make higher interest?)\n\nThis application is about giving you the tools you need to estimate your retirement years.  The calculator lists the assumptions on the front page, and lets you pick your own options\n\nThis retirement calculator takes inflation fully into account.  Many similar calculators ignore inflation, which is a grave mistake.  Even assuming a modest inflation rate of 3%, $100 today will only have the purchasing power of $55, 20 years from now.  It is extremely important to take inflation into account when planning for retirement.\n\nThis app lets you make all the decisions:\nChoose your current age and age of planned retirement\nChoose the rate of inflation (defaulted to the standard 3%)\nChoose the rate of return on your investments.  You are able to calculate different rates of return on different investments, if desired.\nChoose your current Savings and 401k balances\nChoose how much you plan to add to your savings accounts each year.  This will be automatically indexed to the rate of inflation.\n\nChoose your life expectancy age or \"end of retirement\" date to see how much you would be able to spend each year of retirement\nOR\nChoose the spending amount you need to maintain your desired standard of living, and see how many years your nest egg would last.\n\nThis application lets YOU make the choices regarding inflation and rate of return / interest rate.  A small change in these rates can have a drastic effect on projected income.  With this app, YOU get to make that choice.  All rates are defaulted at startup to fairly standard rates.\n\nSave your various retirement scenarios for later retrieval, and to compare against each other.\n\nThis application is Ad-free.  It does not try to sell you financial services, or attempt to persuade you to invest in any particular stocks or bonds.\n\nDisclaimer:  This application is a calculator using your assumptions and input.  It does not provide financial advice.  Please contact a licensed financial planner for specific retirement advice."

By swiping left and right, you can also switch the current date.\n\n2.Intelligent matching tags, faster bookkeeping\nYou don't need to deliberately set the consumer category tag, because the app has a self-learning function, it will remember your bookkeeping records and automatically help you match the tab next time. In most cases, you only need:\n(1) Gesture swipe\n(2) Enter the amount\n(3) Finish\nYou donât even need 3 seconds to add a expense record.\n\n3. iCloud synchronization, data more secure\nThe system supports synchronization, but you don't need to register for an account. Your data will not be sent to our server. You can rest assured that your data will not be seen by others.\n\n4.Simple and easy to use interactive interface, easier to get started\nThe user interface adopts a unique solid color design, which is not only beautiful and fashionable, but also concise and clear, so that you can easily operate it. Our goal is to let you develop the habit of bookkeeping without any guidance.\n\n5.

With the help of bar charts and pie charts, you can not only track your daily expenses and understand your consumption behavior, but you can also develop targeted future consumption plans to save unnecessary expenses.\n\n6. Use Widget to build your Home Screen budget system\nNo need to enter the app,  you can track your expenditure and budget information at any time through the Widget.\n\n\n\nUnlike similar products that emphasize more functions, we always adhere to the design principle of \"less is more\". After continuous improvement, continuous addition and deletion, finally, this application was born.\n\nThank you for using this app. If you love it, please give it a good review."

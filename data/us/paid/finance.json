      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

Or is it a good idea for you to wait until 70 for increased benefits?\n\nThe Social Security Calculator is a powerful estimating tool that can answer these questions and help you plan for retirement.\n\n[ Features ]\n\n• Estimates the most profitable starting age for your benefits based on your income and life expectancy\n\n• Calculates your potential lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages so you can easily compare the results\n\n• Your date of birth and benefit amount at full retirement age are all you need to know (benefits at FRA can be found on your Social Security statement or by creating an account on SSA.gov)\n\n• Optionally include other monthly income, an interest rate for income, monthly expenses, and an interest rate for expenses\n\n• Optionally disable paying down expenses (potentially useful in situations when compounding income exceeds compounding expenses)\n\n• Detailed results are presented in interactive Summary, Spreadsheet, and Graph formats\n\n• Calculation inputs can be labeled and saved for quick retrieval and comparison\n\n• Robust in-app help via information buttons, getting started guide, glossary, and links to additional resources\n\n[ Interactive Results ]\n\n• Summary - a table of life expectancy ages with their most profitable starting ages for benefits. Rows can be expanded to show your estimated lifetime net income for every life expectancy age. The lifetime net income rows can be tapped to highlight the corresponding cell in the Spreadsheet.\n\n• Spreadsheet -  detailed spreadsheet format showing your estimated lifetime net income for all Social Security starting ages and life expectancy ages. Each lifetime net income cell can be tapped to show more detailed information. The differences in lifetime net income amounts can be easily examined for all benefit starting ages.\n\n• Graph - calculation results displayed as lines depicting estimated lifetime net income for each Social Security starting age. Clearly illustrates the differences in lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages. Any starting age line can be toggled on or off. Tapping a point on the graph will display more detailed information. Supports zooming to show increased granularity.\n\n[ Disclaimer ]\n\nWe have carefully followed the benefit rules from the Social Security Administration and have tested to ensure that our calculations are as accurate as possible.

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

Whether you pay monthly rent as a tenant, or whether you're a landlord trying to collect rent, you both may be trying to make ends meet. Sometimes we need help...and that's where this app comes into the picture.\n\nThe Defer My Pay app effortlessly guides you through 3 simple questions (while _never_ asking for, or collecting, personally identifiable information) and then instantly presents you with a customized deferred payment plan that works for both the debtor and the creditor (i.e. the one paying and the one collecting). You can even move back and forth through the questions and adjust as needed. This allows the people on both sides of the transaction get to keep the roof over their heads and food on their tables. It's a win-win.\n\nWe're in this together.\nEverything will be OK.\nLet's work something out."

You can also print blank checks to take with you. \n\nUse as many bank accounts as you want. Each will have its own account number, user information and bank information.\n\nKeep track of all your expenses and deposits with the built-in electronic record book (Register). Balance is calculated automatically. Reconcile with your bank statement just as easily as you would with a paper record book. Save, load data and settings to use different accounts. Set different fonts to print your name on checks.\n\nCheck Writer Plus, will sign your checks automatically with your own picture. \n\nYou can add your logo next to your name and address.\n\nAll elements of the check can be moved to perfectly fit your needs, and you can decide which elements will be printed (convenient for pre-printed paper). \n\nPrint as many blank checks as you want to use them like regular checkbooks.\n\nExtremely accurate MICR E13B technology is used to print special characters at the bottom of checks so they are recognized by bank processing. This font is used daily by regional and nationals banks.\n\nThe Register can be printed in spreadsheet format. Search easily throughout the register content: date, number, memo, amount.\n\nPrint immediately or later, on top, middle, bottom, or three checks per page. Checks can be printed on regular letter-size paper, plain white or color, as well as on professional looking check refill paper available from fine office supply stores. Also, Versacheck #1000, #1001, #1002, #3000, and Personal # 3001.\n\nQuickBooks® or Quicken® paper stock can be used as well. Likewise, using the Blank Checks feature without lines, you can print check paper for QuickBooks® and Quicken®\n\nThe height of checks can be set in Preferences, to accommodate non standard pre-printed paper.\n\nPrinting can be nudged horizontally and vertically very precisely.\n\nWiFi and Google Print are supported.\n\nIMPORTANT :\n----------------\n\nCheck Writer Plus is meant for personal productivity. For uses like payroll or other corporate use, better look towards other, specialized applications.\n\nAs mentioned above, the MICR E13B font used in this application has been purchased by regional and national banks for their own use, after stringent tests. We are absolutely confident they will perform perfectly when used correctly. However, it is necessary to strictly follow these principles :\n\n1 - It is paramount never to use \"scale to fit\". Printing must be done at 100% to insure the MICR printing conforms to standard.\n\n2 - MICR Toner (magnetic ink) is mandatory to meet the American Banking Association MICR E13B standard and U.S. law (Check 21 Act). MICR E13B printing complies with ANSI X9.27-1995, ANSI X9.100-160-1-2009, and Canadian CPA006 standards.\n\nAlthough many banks today use Optical Character Recognition which accepts any ink, some are equipped with readers that require magnetic ink, and will be suspicious of checks printed with ordinary ink.\n\nMICR toner is indistinguishable of regular black toner, and can be acquired from fine office supply stores, Amazon, or other Internet toner vendors.\n\nIf you still have questions, or if you encounter any difficulties using this app, please use the support link to contact us, we will do all we can to help right away."

      "label": "Know your future balance changes to organize your bills, track spending and manage your cash flow. Not just a budget app but your financial fortune teller. \n\nGreen lets you budget without having to budget. Green is not just another generic budgeting app. It is an income and expense tracking app with balance forecasting that automatically predicts your changing account balances over the next year. \n\nHOW GREEN WORKS:\n******************************\n1. Create your forecast\n-- Enter your current account balance\n-- Enter your recurring income and expenses (mortgage/rent, groceries, utilities, savings, etc.) and their occurrence (weekly, monthly, bi-weekly, etc.)\n\n2. Be informed\n-- Know your 3 most important balances, current, pending and lowest\n-- See where you will be financially in the future (a year from now, 6 months from now, etc.)\n-- Make sure you will have enough income to cover future expenses.\n-- Make sure you don’t miss any bills.\n\n3. Budget decisions\n-- Save for unseen expenses.\n-- See how spending money today affects your future finances.\n-- Experiment by adding, removing or adjusting expense items to find out how it affects your bottom line next week, next month even up to a year from now.\n\nTHE FINANCIAL FEED – Your personal finance tracker at a glance\n*************************************************************\nAt the top of your financial feed are your three balances. The Bank balance is what the balance should be in your account. The Pending balance is the difference between outstanding transactions and the Bank balance. The Lowest balance is what your lowest balance may be in the upcoming year. Tap the Lowest title to display the expected date of the lowest balance.\n\nAfter the balances is a forecast graph. This graph is the anticipated balances change over the upcoming year based on your budget. This is an easy way to know if your spending is trending up or down.\n\nThe last three sections are transactions. They are broken down into lists for pending, upcoming and past transactions. Pending transactions list income or expenses activities that you completed but it hasn’t reflected in your account yet. Once they have cleared your account, the transaction can be cleared in Green (swipe let on the transaction) and it moves to the Past 30 days’ section. The Past 30 Days’ section contains all the transactions that occurred in the last 30 days. Your whole account transaction history can be exported as an excel file for further evaluation by swiping left on an account in the settings menu. The upcoming section shows what transactions are coming up. Just swipe left on the transaction to pay early or wait for the scheduled date when the transaction automatically moves to the Pending section.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO?\n****************************\n- Know when it's safe to spend\n- Analyze your spending history\n- Never forget another bill again\n- Be budget aware even when you spend\n- Have confidence in controlling your money\n- Setup multiple budgets for different accounts\n\nDon’t avoid controlling your money because it seems too intimidating and scary because with Green it’s easy. Because of Green’s forecast capability, you can plan for unexpected expenses, pay off debt earlier and finally take control of your money. Once you’re in control of your money your stress level will go down. Live life in control."

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nAdding Machine features dual keypads with a total (*) key on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n====  Recent Press  =====\nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category for iPad.\n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key Adding Machine app.\"\n=================\n\n\nSpecifications:\n=================\n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine.\n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility.\n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history (full version)\n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float\n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use.\n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines\n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style)\n● Comprehensive set of help screens.\n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region).\n\n \n================\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calculator’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

Caveat notes are provided as a separate extendable database on chart patterns as well as other references.\n\nCandice comes with three game study operations: Flashcards, Guess and Press, and Slide Show to learn candle patterns.

      "label": "The finance app for Total Returns (includes dividends and interest) on over 10,000 global stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, with history from 1980. Provides income, price charts as well as numerical output. Built with data collaboration from EODHistoricalData.com \n\nThe app is specifically built to bring out Total Returns that include dividends or bond interest, exclusion of which can cause ranking inversion and under-allocation to low volatility assets.\n\n#*# After tapping in a ticker or tickers, pls. hit 'return' *not* Swipe. Then Swipe between screens.\n\n#*# Share charts using the iPhone Screen Capture method to post online\n\n***Use the App to find ETFs, stocks and funds that have high Dividend yields. Web charts flatline such charts, since they are price only.\n\n***A simple way to find your ticker syntax is to look it up via EODHistoricalData.com {U.S. listed tickers do not require .US extension, eg MSFT and MSFT.us are both OK; SAP.xetra, 6752.tse for Panasonic, DJI.indx for Dow Jones index etc.}\n\n-Backtest your portfolio on the fly (stress testing) with total returns that include dividends / bond interest. See how your stocks would do say from 1/2007-3/2009 or 1/2020-3/2020\n\n-Designed by a Finance professor and a development team from Canada, Germany and Switzerland, this app has had thousands of downloads since 2012 (free for my students), pls. see cloudEpsilon.com or CorrectCharts.com for the idea, research and examples.\n\n-The problem being rectified by the App has also been written up in the WSJ (Jul 2011). \n\n-No tables, numbers, dividends, interest, splits or distributions to download -  enter the ticker, the Start and End dates, swipe. Done! Allows comparison of up to 8 tickers, at a time. \n\n-Total Returns are useful for calculating income tax and investment taxes too.  The App also lets you compare a security with itself so you instantly see the return differential. Touch the radio button on the output screen for 'price only' returns.\n-\"App is unique and useful but needs an iOS13 update.\" ~ 2020\n-Some user requests for the iOS8 upgrade, 2015: \n\" Yes, I’m in finance. It’s an incredibly useful tool to be able to chart it this way. Thanks!\" Wealth manager from Texas.\n\"Please, please, please tell me you're going to have a updated version for iOS 8. This is the best app ever.\" CFA from Ohio.\n\"Is the App getting an update to be co playable with iOS8? It's such a useful app!\" Football Quarterback.\n\"This helps me build my portfolio and review investments: total return vs. yield vs. capital gains compared between investments and also combined into a portfolio.\"\n\"Thank you... As I said, I really like it and have not found an alternative.\" MIT alum.\n\n-Google_Finance, Bloomberg web and [Yahoo ] stock charts do not include dividends in total return or comparative return charts. \n\n-You can input multiple securities at the same time to see cumulative return charts and associated return numbers. You have the option to see charts inclusive or exclusive of dividends and interest (Total return or Price return).  Just three screens and a few taps. Done!  \n\n-The App has been downloaded in USA, Australia, Switzerland, France, Finland, Sweden, Taiwan, Mexico, Thailand, UK, China, Turkey, Israel, Portugal, Japan, India, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand).\n\nThanks and please leave a review on the App store, we have no marketing.\n\nhttp://cloudepsilon.com\n\nPlease note:\n• A one time payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Data licensing restricts us from offering a free trial period\n\nTOS: http://correctcharts.com/returnfinder/img/disclaimer_returnfinder.pdf\nEULA: \nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy: http://correctcharts.com/returnfinder/img/privacy_policy_returnfinder.pdf"

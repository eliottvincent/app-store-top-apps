We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nAdding Machine features dual keypads with a total (*) key on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n====  Recent Press  =====\nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category for iPad.\n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key Adding Machine app.\"\n=================\n\n\nSpecifications:\n=================\n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine.\n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility.\n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history (full version)\n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float\n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use.\n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines\n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style)\n● Comprehensive set of help screens.\n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region).\n\n \n================\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calculator’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

This app does not send any TSP data that you add to it to any central entity. This app does not require your TSP account information nor is there any way to store your account access details into the app.\n\nTo set an alert select a fund from the alert screen. Examine the graphs at the bottom of the screen by touching the graphs to alternately show the “Twelve Days”, “Twelve Weeks”, and “Twelve Months” graphs. Select from “Previous Day”, “A Week Ago”, and “A Month Ago”. Set a percentage from 0.00 percent to 12.5% and touch the “Done” button. Once set, the funds status will be on the “Alert” screen. The alert for this fund will be \"on\" or the alert will have text in red for negative or text in green for positive results.\n\nTo see how much you would have in the C-Fund if you had invested $100 per pay period since the beginning of the TSP program you could simply press the “+” button on the “Track” screen, select “Pick Fund” then select “C-Fund”, Select “Dollar Amount” under “Recurring Investment” and enter 100, select the date field under “Recurring Investment” and choose June 2 2003, then press “Done”. The answer will be displayed on the “Track” screen. If you use \"Track\" for your investments assure the dates match those TSP.\n\nTerms of Agreement\nBy using the app including content, updates and new releases that are provided, you accept that you are bound by this Agreement.

Rule of thumb is to enter 1 for yourself and add another 1 for each additional dependant in your household. Paid wages (year-to-date) are assumed to be 0, therefore a minor descrepancy with your actual paycheck is expected at the end of the year.\n\nTo produce the most accurate paycheck calculation please upgrade to Payrollguru app, that considers the number of allowances and paid year-to-date wages, and allows for additional pre-tax and post-tax deductions.\n\nPaycheck Calculator can be used by employees and employers in the US to verify accuracy of actual paychecks. Can email result to any person. \n\nGreat tool to compare take-home amounts after taxes in different states and/or in different pay scenarios, such as married vs. single, weekly vs. monthly. Helps to plan your budget and future spending. \n\nEnjoy using it and please review it the app if you like it."

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

You can also print blank checks to take with you. \n\nUse as many bank accounts as you want. Each will have its own account number, user information and bank information.\n\nKeep track of all your expenses and deposits with the built-in electronic record book (Register). Balance is calculated automatically. Reconcile with your bank statement just as easily as you would with a paper record book. Save, load data and settings to use different accounts. Set different fonts to print your name on checks.\n\nCheck Writer Plus, will sign your checks automatically with your own picture. \n\nYou can add your logo next to your name and address.\n\nAll elements of the check can be moved to perfectly fit your needs, and you can decide which elements will be printed (convenient for pre-printed paper). \n\nPrint as many blank checks as you want to use them like regular checkbooks.\n\nExtremely accurate MICR E13B technology is used to print special characters at the bottom of checks so they are recognized by bank processing. This font is used daily by regional and nationals banks.\n\nThe Register can be printed in spreadsheet format. Search easily throughout the register content: date, number, memo, amount.\n\nPrint immediately or later, on top, middle, bottom, or three checks per page. Checks can be printed on regular letter-size paper, plain white or color, as well as on professional looking check refill paper available from fine office supply stores. Also, Versacheck #1000, #1001, #1002, #3000, and Personal # 3001.\n\nQuickBooks® or Quicken® paper stock can be used as well. Likewise, using the Blank Checks feature without lines, you can print check paper for QuickBooks® and Quicken®\n\nThe height of checks can be set in Preferences, to accommodate non standard pre-printed paper.\n\nPrinting can be nudged horizontally and vertically very precisely.\n\nWiFi and Google Print are supported.\n\nIMPORTANT :\n----------------\n\nCheck Writer Plus is meant for personal productivity. For uses like payroll or other corporate use, better look towards other, specialized applications.\n\nAs mentioned above, the MICR E13B font used in this application has been purchased by regional and national banks for their own use, after stringent tests. We are absolutely confident they will perform perfectly when used correctly. However, it is necessary to strictly follow these principles :\n\n1 - It is paramount never to use \"scale to fit\". Printing must be done at 100% to insure the MICR printing conforms to standard.\n\n2 - MICR Toner (magnetic ink) is mandatory to meet the American Banking Association MICR E13B standard and U.S. law (Check 21 Act). MICR E13B printing complies with ANSI X9.27-1995, ANSI X9.100-160-1-2009, and Canadian CPA006 standards.\n\nAlthough many banks today use Optical Character Recognition which accepts any ink, some are equipped with readers that require magnetic ink, and will be suspicious of checks printed with ordinary ink.\n\nMICR toner is indistinguishable of regular black toner, and can be acquired from fine office supply stores, Amazon, or other Internet toner vendors.\n\nIf you still have questions, or if you encounter any difficulties using this app, please use the support link to contact us, we will do all we can to help right away."

Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

Taxes App helps you to figure out the correct amount of Federal and State taxes to withhold from your paycheck.  If you are self-employed, it helps you to figure out estimated taxes.  If you are employed, self-employed, have investment income, etc., it helps figure out income taxes for that too!\n\nTaxes App is great for any Do-It-Yourself type of person and is also great for professionals assisting clients.  Taxes App gives you the ability to run income tax projections in seconds.  It’s also great if you want to learn more about different types of income, deductions, & tax credits and how those affect your tax bill.\n\nIncludes Tax Years 2023, 2022, & 2021.\n\nNote - States are slow to update their tax brackets.  If current-year state brackets are unavailable, prior-year brackets will be used until the state issues current-year brackets.\n\nFederal calculations include:\n- Ordinary federal income tax.\n- Self-employment tax.\n- Self-employment tax deduction. \n- Additional Medicare (Self-employment only).\n- Qualified business income deduction with threshold & phaseout.\n- Net investment income tax.\n- Child tax credit with phase-out.\n- Standard deduction.\n- Ability to manually add for-agi deductions.\n- Ability to manually add other tax credits.\n- Ability to manually add other taxes.\n- Ability to run withholding/estimated tax payments projections.\n\nState calculations include:\n- Ordinary state income tax.\n- Self-Employment Tax Deduction add-back - PA.\n- Standard deduction, personal exemption, dependent exemption (does not include phaseout, but a few states do not calculate these based on a low-income phaseout).\n- Federal QBI Deduction - CO, ID, & ND.\n- Federal 50% QBI Deduction - IA (2022 & 2021 Only).\n- Federal Income Tax Deduction - IA - (2022 & 2021 Only).\n- Ability to manually add state deductions & state additions.\n- Ability to manually add other tax credits.\n- Ability to manually add other taxes.\n- Ability to run withholding/estimated tax payments projections.\n- Taxes App on most states calculates tax on state taxable income at ordinary state tax rates. This should overestimate taxes due if your state has favorable rates on certain types of income.\n\nTaxes App is brought to you by Adam Myrick, CPA, a solo developer.

      "label": "Follow us on Twitter at @CashflowsApp!\n\nCashflows Pro helps you forecast future balances of your bank accounts. It's simple to set up and requires minimal effort to maintain.\n\nTell it about your recurring transactions (including transfers between accounts) and future one-time transactions, and let it estimate your account balances months (or years) into the future.\n\nIt's not interested in the past, so there's no need to enter or maintain your transaction history.\n\nIt shows your account transactions and balances over time and lets you override individual payment dates and amounts. Quickly toggle payments on and off to see how they impact your future balances. The graph updates immediately with any changes you make.\n\nUpdate the starting balance occasionally, and it'll show you which transactions are still due. If any have already occurred (or are late) just tap & hold to toggle them on or off.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Multiple accounts: Add multiple accounts and set up recurring or manual transfers between them.\n- Recurring transactions: Supports recurring transactions with start date, end date (optional) and many recurrence options.\n- Warning balance: Set a warning balance for an account and see at a glance when your balance is below it.\n- Interactive forecast graph: Shows your future balance over time, highlighting warning balance and negative regions; tap the graph for a closer look at the nearby transactions.\n- File-based: Keep multiple scenarios in separate files. Open backup files from Cashflows or Total Cashflow.\n\nMANY USES:\n\n* Planning Future Purchases:\n\nThis is a great tool for forecasting payments for a future loan, mortgage or car lease. Create a recurring transaction for the payment amount, fill in the first and last payment dates and see how it affects your balance. Make adjustments to figure out what you can afford.\n\n* Planning for Change:\n\nYou might have a recurring bill that increases annually (such as health insurance). Simply create another recurring transaction to represent the increased payment and set its start date appropriately, and adjust the end date of the original transaction. You'll immediately see how it affects your finances in the future.\n\n* Planning for Uncertainty:\n\nThe forecasts are only as accurate as you need them to be. If you plan to pay a minimum amount per month onto your credit card, set that up as a recurring transaction. Once you decide how much you want to pay this month, just override the forecast amount. You can always edit or delete the override later.\n\n* Getting Out of Debt:\n\nThis app can help you get out of debt, and figure out how long it will take. Enter a recurring transaction between your checking / current and loan / credit account for the minimum amount you intend to pay each month. Extend the forecast period (tap \"More\" at the bottom of the Forecast page) and then look at the Balance Graphs for your accounts. If you can afford to pay extra in a few months, override that month's payment (or create a one-time transaction for the additional amount). You'll instantly see the effect on your checking / current balance, loan balance and when the loan will be repaid."

What is the difference between this App and Interlocken's 'Adding Machine: 10 Key Calc' in the App. Store? \nA1. Both calculators are single-column adding devices. Both have iPad versions with full-size (1:1) keyboards. 'Accountant Calculator' supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works, while 'Adding Machine: 10 Key Calc' uses inverted number/operator entry, the same as a 10 Key adding machine, commonly used by Accountants and CPA's. \n\nQ2. Can I touch-type? \nA2. Checkout the iPad version with its large (1:1) keypad and several aids for touch-typing. \n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape? \nA3. Just double-tap the round 'i' (info) button to clear the paper tape. \n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape? \nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch Add or Delete Line. You can also edit numbers, and split Add/Sub or Mul/Div groups. Press Done to return to Calculator mode \n\nQ5. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA5. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

After entering your debts in the application, you can analyze how the choice of payment strategy or different extra amounts helps you pay off your debts sooner, and save on the total interest paid.  Debt Strategy supports multiple strategies such as:\n\n- Minimum Payments Only\n- Lowest Balances First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n- Highest Interest Rate First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n\nDebt Strategy helps you to take control of your debts. Pick one debt, either one with the lowest balance or one with the highest interest rate, and focus on paying it off first by paying a little more than the minimum. This will shave months off your debt. With your other debts, continue paying just the minimum. After you finish paying off the first debt, move on to the 2nd debt per your strategy. Roll over the amount you paid each month from your first debt to pay off this one. You will pay off the second debt even more quickly. Continue this strategy until all your debts are paid.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Ability to enter debts and track debts.\n- Ability to identify the best pay-off strategy, and perform what-if analysis with different additional amounts and pay-off strategies\n- Graphical view of how the debts will be paid off\n- Pie/Bar charts for debt break down by category, or remaining balance\n- Monthly payment schedule for each debt\n- Ability to enter payments during the life of the loan, and accurately track remaining balances\n- Payment reminders so you can make your payments on time\n- Ability to override the home currency\n- Option to email a report\n- Password protection"

Calculations that update as soon as you make a change.\n\n• Automatically switches between calculating loan amount or monthly mortgage payment depending on what is being modified.  No need for multiple screens or controls.\n\n• Optional keyboard entry for precision when you need to calculate to the nearest $.01 or 1/1000th of a percent.\n\n• Calculations for fixed-rate mortgages of any term. From the most popular 30-year & 15-year loans to the more unusual 10-year, 40-year or any number of years you enter.\n\n\nYou'll get quick answers to your loan financing questions because SliderCalc isn't bogged down with details like PMI, property taxes, insurance, down payments and closing costs.  It is the perfect tool to calculate mortgage interest rates, payments, and loan amounts with the freedom to \"slide\" those numbers around and test alternative scenarios.\n\n- July 22, 2010\n*iOS4 Users: You will be happy to find that the bug in the % rate display has been fixed in this release.

With iAllowance, you can create an unlimited number of banks for each of your kids.

      "label": "Know your future balance changes to organize your bills, track spending and manage your cash flow. Not just a budget app but your financial fortune teller. \n\nGreen lets you budget without having to budget. Green is not just another generic budgeting app. It is an income and expense tracking app with balance forecasting that automatically predicts your changing account balances over the next year. \n\nHOW GREEN WORKS:\n******************************\n1. Create your forecast\n-- Enter your current account balance\n-- Enter your recurring income and expenses (mortgage/rent, groceries, utilities, savings, etc.) and their occurrence (weekly, monthly, bi-weekly, etc.)\n\n2. Be informed\n-- Know your 3 most important balances, current, pending and lowest\n-- See where you will be financially in the future (a year from now, 6 months from now, etc.)\n-- Make sure you will have enough income to cover future expenses.\n-- Make sure you don’t miss any bills.\n\n3. Budget decisions\n-- Save for unseen expenses.\n-- See how spending money today affects your future finances.\n-- Experiment by adding, removing or adjusting expense items to find out how it affects your bottom line next week, next month even up to a year from now.\n\nTHE FINANCIAL FEED – Your personal finance tracker at a glance\n*************************************************************\nAt the top of your financial feed are your three balances. The Bank balance is what the balance should be in your account. The Pending balance is the difference between outstanding transactions and the Bank balance. The Lowest balance is what your lowest balance may be in the upcoming year. Tap the Lowest title to display the expected date of the lowest balance.\n\nAfter the balances is a forecast graph. This graph is the anticipated balances change over the upcoming year based on your budget. This is an easy way to know if your spending is trending up or down.\n\nThe last three sections are transactions. They are broken down into lists for pending, upcoming and past transactions. Pending transactions list income or expenses activities that you completed but it hasn’t reflected in your account yet. Once they have cleared your account, the transaction can be cleared in Green (swipe let on the transaction) and it moves to the Past 30 days’ section. The Past 30 Days’ section contains all the transactions that occurred in the last 30 days. Your whole account transaction history can be exported as an excel file for further evaluation by swiping left on an account in the settings menu. The upcoming section shows what transactions are coming up. Just swipe left on the transaction to pay early or wait for the scheduled date when the transaction automatically moves to the Pending section.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO?\n****************************\n- Know when it's safe to spend\n- Analyze your spending history\n- Never forget another bill again\n- Be budget aware even when you spend\n- Have confidence in controlling your money\n- Setup multiple budgets for different accounts\n\nDon’t avoid controlling your money because it seems too intimidating and scary because with Green it’s easy. Because of Green’s forecast capability, you can plan for unexpected expenses, pay off debt earlier and finally take control of your money. Once you’re in control of your money your stress level will go down. Live life in control."

What is the difference between this App, 'Adding Machine 10Key Universal', and 'Accountant Universal for iPad' in the App. Store.? \nA1. Both calculators are single-column adding machines or calculators with full-size (1:1) keypads and are optimized for the iPad User Interface. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calc’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works. \n\nQ2. Can I touch-type? \nA2. The iPad version comes as close to touch-typing as a touch-screen can be. v2.1 introduces TypeTone. With TypeTone, a key will guide your finger back to the center of a key with an audio tone. \n\nQ3. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape? \nA3. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers, split Add/Sub or Mul/Div groups. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA5. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

      "label": "What is the best age to start your Social Security benefits? What if you start at 62 with reduced benefits, but invest and get compound interest? Or is it a good idea for you to wait until 70 for increased benefits?\n\nThe Social Security Calculator is a powerful estimating tool that can answer these questions and help you plan for retirement.\n\n[ Features ]\n\n• Estimates the most profitable starting age for your benefits based on your income and life expectancy\n\n• Calculates your potential lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages so you can easily compare the results\n\n• Your date of birth and benefit amount at full retirement age are all you need to know (benefits at FRA can be found on your Social Security statement or by creating an account on SSA.gov)\n\n• Optionally include other monthly income, an interest rate for income, monthly expenses, and an interest rate for expenses\n\n• Optionally disable paying down expenses (potentially useful in situations when compounding income exceeds compounding expenses)\n\n• Detailed results are presented in interactive Summary, Spreadsheet, and Graph formats\n\n• Calculation inputs can be labeled and saved for quick retrieval and comparison\n\n• Robust in-app help via information buttons, getting started guide, glossary, and links to additional resources\n\n[ Interactive Results ]\n\n• Summary - a table of life expectancy ages with their most profitable starting ages for benefits. Rows can be expanded to show your estimated lifetime net income for every life expectancy age. The lifetime net income rows can be tapped to highlight the corresponding cell in the Spreadsheet.\n\n• Spreadsheet -  detailed spreadsheet format showing your estimated lifetime net income for all Social Security starting ages and life expectancy ages. Each lifetime net income cell can be tapped to show more detailed information. The differences in lifetime net income amounts can be easily examined for all benefit starting ages.\n\n• Graph - calculation results displayed as lines depicting estimated lifetime net income for each Social Security starting age. Clearly illustrates the differences in lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages. Any starting age line can be toggled on or off. Tapping a point on the graph will display more detailed information. Supports zooming to show increased granularity.\n\n[ Disclaimer ]\n\nWe have carefully followed the benefit rules from the Social Security Administration and have tested to ensure that our calculations are as accurate as possible.  However, since we are not affiliated with the SSA, this app is only intended to be used for reference.  Before making a retirement decision we strongly recommend reviewing SSA.gov and other resources for more information.

Sometimes we need help...and that's where this app comes into the picture.\n\nThe Defer My Pay app effortlessly guides you through 3 simple questions (while _never_ asking for, or collecting, personally identifiable information) and then instantly presents you with a customized deferred payment plan that works for both the debtor and the creditor (i.e. the one paying and the one collecting). You can even move back and forth through the questions and adjust as needed. This allows the people on both sides of the transaction get to keep the roof over their heads and food on their tables. It's a win-win.\n\nWe're in this together.\nEverything will be OK.\nLet's work something out."

Additionally it validates the card number.\n\nDo you run a shop or office where you need to take orders that are paid for by credit card over the phone? Need to check that the card information a customer is giving you is valid? With Bank Card Checker you can be sure that a card number is valid and perform extra checks on the card such as the Bank or financial institution that issued it, what country it was issued in, whether it is a company/corporate or personal card and whether it's a credit/debit/visa/mastercard etc.\n\nThis incredibly easy to use application lets you view Credit or Debit Card Issuer data on your iPhone as well as validating the card number. The App interrogates its internal database of Card Issuer data to tell you the name of the bank or financial institution, the country the card was issued in, whether the card is a consumer or corporate account and the scheme type (VISA Credit, VISA Debit, Mastercard Credit, Maestro etc) .\n\nThe App can determine Card Issuer data from just the first 9 digits of the card number. In order to check that the number is valid then the whole number must be entered. \n\nThe internal database has hundreds of thousands of banks/financial institutions records in it ensuring that more than 99% of the worlds organisations are covered. The App will be updated regularly to ensure that the database stays up to date.\n\nThe App does not store any entered card data and does not connect to the internet to obtain issuer data.\n\nNOTE: The App does not check card expiry dates. This data is not publicly available."

      "label": "No ADs or In-App Purchases. \n\nFor any issues please contact us at DIYIMPLEMENTER@GMAIL.COM\n\nThis Intrinsic Value Calculator is based on Warren Buffett \"Ten Cap Price\" otherwise known as \"Owner Earnings\" calculation. Buffett is calling Owner Earnings: \"the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses.\" \n\nPer Warren Buffett Value Investment Theory the buy decision should be based on several factors: \n\n1. Company must have competitive advantage... \n2. Company performed admirably in the past 10 years, recovered after market correction(s) and recession(s)... \n3. Company must have long term prospects - be relevant in 10 years from now... \n4. Company's market price should be 20-30% less than calculated intrinsic value - margin of safety price. \n\nThe logical question you would ask is how is it possible for such a good company to have the market price 20-30% bellow intrinsic value? The answer is: YES it's possible due to various reasons. The potential reasons could include: bad news about the company, company's industry is out of market favor, market is in correction or recession... \n\nWarren Buffett indicator -> the historical ratio of Total Market Cap over GDP is currently at 195%. Meaning we are in the biggest Stock Market BUBBLE in the history of the world!!! \n\nThis is undeniable proof that we are in the Market Bubble that is bigger than \"DOT-COM Bubble\" of 2001 or \"Housing Bubble\" of 2008. It's just a matter of time before this Market Bubble will inevitably POP presenting an opportunity for Value Investors to buy their favorite stocks for less than intrinsic value! But in order to buy your favorite stocks for less than intrinsic value you need to know what this intrinsic value is.  This is when our Intrinsic Value Calculator comes handy. You can calculate, store, reload and compare intrinsic value with market price anywhere and anytime, and all you need is your phone and our application.\n\nYou can read more about Value Investing online. We would recommend - \"The Intelligent Investor\" book written by Benjamin Graham - Warren Buffett's teacher and the founder of Value Investment Theory.\n\nThe goal of this application is to help value investors with calculation of intrinsic value. Most of the values required for calculation could be found on company's latest annual report. Annual reports can be found on company's website in investor relations section. Values missing in annual report could be found on GOOGLE. \n\nEach edit field has a corresponding help button to explain the meaning and location of the data on company's annual report.\n\n\"Examples\" button would display actual values for Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Alibaba, Baidu and all FAANG stocks: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet’s Google. Based on the calculated intrinsic values representing the real value of these stocks we can conclude this Stock Market BUBBLE would be called \"FAANG Bubble\".\n\n\"Save Data\" button would save data to your phone storage at \"IntrinsicValueData\" folder as comma separated \".CSV\" file.\n\n\"Load Saved Data\" button would display list of files \".CSV\" saved at \"IntrinsicValueData\" folder. \n\n\".CSV\" files in \"IntrinsicValueData\" folder could be copied to PC and loaded to MS Excel for further analyses. \n\nYou can use this calculator literally anywhere, after all, it comes with your phone… It’s easy to use, all you need is to find and load annual report to your phone using internet browser as PDF file, search for required values, cut and paste values to the calculator and press Calculate button. Now you know if the stock is the bargain or overvalued based on company’s annual report and not on subjective opinion of various market analysts who could be biased based on their own long or short position on particular stock…\n\nThis method doesn’t take growth into account. \n\nIf you like the app we would really appreciate your positive review.\n\n© 2022 Best Implementer LLC"

      "label": "Print checks and their cover letter on the same page directly from your iOS device with this easy to use check printing application : enter the order (payee), the Dollar amount, and voila ! \n\nCheck Writer Plus will automatically generate the word amount so you do not have to worry about spelling it out. You can also print blank checks to take with you. \n\nUse as many bank accounts as you want. Each will have its own account number, user information and bank information.\n\nKeep track of all your expenses and deposits with the built-in electronic record book (Register). Balance is calculated automatically. Reconcile with your bank statement just as easily as you would with a paper record book. Save, load data and settings to use different accounts. Set different fonts to print your name on checks.\n\nCheck Writer Plus, will sign your checks automatically with your own picture. \n\nYou can add your logo next to your name and address.\n\nAll elements of the check can be moved to perfectly fit your needs, and you can decide which elements will be printed (convenient for pre-printed paper). \n\nPrint as many blank checks as you want to use them like regular checkbooks.\n\nExtremely accurate MICR E13B technology is used to print special characters at the bottom of checks so they are recognized by bank processing. This font is used daily by regional and nationals banks.\n\nThe Register can be printed in spreadsheet format. Search easily throughout the register content: date, number, memo, amount.\n\nPrint immediately or later, on top, middle, bottom, or three checks per page. Checks can be printed on regular letter-size paper, plain white or color, as well as on professional looking check refill paper available from fine office supply stores. Also, Versacheck #1000, #1001, #1002, #3000, and Personal # 3001.\n\nQuickBooks® or Quicken® paper stock can be used as well. Likewise, using the Blank Checks feature without lines, you can print check paper for QuickBooks® and Quicken®\n\nThe height of checks can be set in Preferences, to accommodate non standard pre-printed paper.\n\nPrinting can be nudged horizontally and vertically very precisely.\n\nWiFi and Google Print are supported.\n\nIMPORTANT :\n----------------\n\nCheck Writer Plus is meant for personal productivity. For uses like payroll or other corporate use, better look towards other, specialized applications.\n\nAs mentioned above, the MICR E13B font used in this application has been purchased by regional and national banks for their own use, after stringent tests. We are absolutely confident they will perform perfectly when used correctly. However, it is necessary to strictly follow these principles :\n\n1 - It is paramount never to use \"scale to fit\". Printing must be done at 100% to insure the MICR printing conforms to standard.\n\n2 - MICR Toner (magnetic ink) is mandatory to meet the American Banking Association MICR E13B standard and U.S. law (Check 21 Act). MICR E13B printing complies with ANSI X9.27-1995, ANSI X9.100-160-1-2009, and Canadian CPA006 standards.\n\nAlthough many banks today use Optical Character Recognition which accepts any ink, some are equipped with readers that require magnetic ink, and will be suspicious of checks printed with ordinary ink.\n\nMICR toner is indistinguishable of regular black toner, and can be acquired from fine office supply stores, Amazon, or other Internet toner vendors.\n\nIf you still have questions, or if you encounter any difficulties using this app, please use the support link to contact us, we will do all we can to help right away."

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nAdding Machine features dual keypads with a total (*) key on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n====  Recent Press  =====\nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category for iPad.\n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key Adding Machine app.\"\n=================\n\n\nSpecifications:\n=================\n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine.\n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility.\n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history (full version)\n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float\n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use.\n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines\n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style)\n● Comprehensive set of help screens.\n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region).\n\n \n================\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calculator’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

      "label": "Whether you're a business or leisure traveler, hopping from country to country is a breeze when you have Currency+ in your hands!  This Universal currency conversion application for the iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch shows you what you're paying instantly and is easy to use even when you have jet lag.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Currency Calculator\n- Apple Watch Support\n- Today Widget\n- Support For Over 150 World Currencies, Precious Metals & Bitcoin\n- Historical Charts\n- Trend Analysis\n- Background Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\n- Editable Calculator Tape\n- Inverse Currency Calculations\n- Transaction Fees or Taxes\n- 100% Ad Free\n\nWhat Makes Currency+ stand out from other Currency Apps?\n\nCurrency Calculator\nWhen you are traveling in a different country, most of the time your focus will be on converting the local currency back to your home currency. The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

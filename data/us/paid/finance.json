The debt-snowball method is the primary debt management technique taught and recommended by many financial experts.

Sometimes we need help...and that's where this app comes into the picture.\n\nThe Defer My Pay app effortlessly guides you through 3 simple questions (while _never_ asking for, or collecting, personally identifiable information) and then instantly presents you with a customized deferred payment plan that works for both the debtor and the creditor (i.e. the one paying and the one collecting). You can even move back and forth through the questions and adjust as needed. This allows the people on both sides of the transaction get to keep the roof over their heads and food on their tables. It's a win-win.\n\nWe're in this together.\nEverything will be OK.\nLet's work something out."

This easy-to-use app helps you eliminate debt using the “debt snowball” method that is taught and endorsed by many financial professionals. \n\nFeatured in Parade Magazine's Intelligence Report. (April 2012)\n\nFeatured in iTunes \"Top 20 apps in 2011 to improve your fitness and finances\"\n\nThe best Debt Snowball app in iTunes\n\nThis app is used and recommended by many financial advisors, firms, and banks.  Simply input your debts (including balance, interest rate, and monthly payment) and Debt Snowball Pro will help you select the best payoff method.\n\nUsing the debt snowball method of payment, once you pay off a debt, you’ll apply the previous payment to the next debt, resulting in a snowball effect as the amount paid toward your larger loans grows over time.\n\nYou can choose to pay off debts with higher interest rates first (to save money), or those with the lowest balances (for small, motivating successes along the way). Debt Snowball Pro shows you just how much money you’ll save by choosing these methods over making minimum payments.\n\nView our demonstration on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ4Ce7ujDxc\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n•Easy-to-use interface.\n•Password protection.\n•Ability to add and remove debts, update balances, and see when you will be debt-free.\n•Shows interest saved and debt payoff dates.\n•Detailed Payment Schedule spreadsheet, showing effects of applying snowball payments to individual debts.\n•Ability to quickly make payments on individual loans.\n•iCloud support so you can easily share data between devices.\n•Progress bars to show and encourage progress.\n•Custom notification to remind you when each bill is due.\n•Ability to share on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nNOTE:\nThis also makes a great gift to family and friends.  Click the down arrow on the left (next to Buy App) and choose \"Gift This App\".\n\nCOMMENTS:\nPlease send your comments, suggestions, and questions to matt.l.king@comcast.net.\n\nREVIEWS:\n\"This is an excellent App! One of the most important keys to success when trying to get out of debt is ‘Concentration’ on the goal.  The Debt Snowball is a goal. Having the information readily available to look at may keep more people motivated towards attaining their goal of becoming debt free.\"\n- enemyofdebt.com\n\n\"My husband and I both use Debt Snowball Pro.  The peace of mind that I got from having a plan set and seeing the \"end date goal\" is worth every penny.  Before using Debt Snowball there was a constant nagging feeling in the back of my head that kept me from ever being completely relaxed.  Now, with the goal in site I feel so much better about our situation.  If you have several loans you should not hesitate, get the app.  Follow the steps and get your own peace of mind and start working toward freedom from debt\"\n- AquababeJen\n\n\"Great app to manage and control your debts.  Simple to use and understand and can save you a ton of real money\"\n-casey_tx\n\nIf you like this app you will also like our other apps:\nMortgage Calculator +\nLoan Calculator - What if?\nRandom Fun Facts\nScripture of the Day - (NASB Version)\nToday in American History\nRandom Crazy Illusions\nTravel Bingo & Blackout\nGrocery Bingo\nBizarre Holidays"

Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. You can also export paper tape files to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs). \n\n========== \nCPA's and Accountants: Please find 'Adding Machine: 10 Key Calc' in the App Store which is a 10-key compliant adding machine with reverse numeric/operator entry to add streams of numbers (see the 1st FAQ). \n========== \n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Accountant Lite Calculator' in the app store. \n\n\n==== Recent Press ==== \n● iPad version is proudly ranked in \"Top 10 - Finance\" in the App Store. \n\n● Strategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator…..check out Interlocken's 'Accountant Calc' (for iPad).\" \n\n● AppsWild.com: \"Whether you're tracking your monthly budget, coming up with an estimate of costs for a project you're working on....this App should be your first choice.\" \n========== \n\n\nAbout \n========== \n● Review up to 350 lines of your paper tape and fix errors as needed. \n● Freely chain + - x / % 1/x √ \n● Export a PDF file to iBooks, Dropbox, Email, or your favorite printing utility. \n● Add comments using voice dictation.\n● Add, delete and modify lines and recompute results automatically.\n● UNDO/REDO. \n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use. \n● Includes the Perfect % Key \n● Customize your fonts, color, and sounds and keypads \n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float \n● Comprehensive set of help screens. \n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region). \n========== \n\n\n========== \nFAQs \n\nQ1. What is the difference between this App and Interlocken's 'Adding Machine: 10 Key Calc' in the App. Store? \nA1. Both calculators are single-column adding devices. Both have iPad versions with full-size (1:1) keyboards. 'Accountant Calculator' supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works, while 'Adding Machine: 10 Key Calc' uses inverted number/operator entry, the same as a 10 Key adding machine, commonly used by Accountants and CPA's. \n\nQ2. Can I touch-type? \nA2. Checkout the iPad version with its large (1:1) keypad and several aids for touch-typing. \n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape? \nA3. Just double-tap the round 'i' (info) button to clear the paper tape. \n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape? \nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch Add or Delete Line. You can also edit numbers, and split Add/Sub or Mul/Div groups. Press Done to return to Calculator mode \n\nQ5. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA5. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

      "label": "Know your future balance changes to organize your bills, track spending and manage your cash flow. Not just a budget app but your financial fortune teller. \n\nGreen lets you budget without having to budget. Green is not just another generic budgeting app. It is an income and expense tracking app with balance forecasting that automatically predicts your changing account balances over the next year. \n\nHOW GREEN WORKS:\n******************************\n1. Create your forecast\n-- Enter your current account balance\n-- Enter your recurring income and expenses (mortgage/rent, groceries, utilities, savings, etc.) and their occurrence (weekly, monthly, bi-weekly, etc.)\n\n2. Be informed\n-- Know your 3 most important balances, current, pending and lowest\n-- See where you will be financially in the future (a year from now, 6 months from now, etc.)\n-- Make sure you will have enough income to cover future expenses.\n-- Make sure you don’t miss any bills.\n\n3. Budget decisions\n-- Save for unseen expenses.\n-- See how spending money today affects your future finances.\n-- Experiment by adding, removing or adjusting expense items to find out how it affects your bottom line next week, next month even up to a year from now.\n\nTHE FINANCIAL FEED – Your personal finance tracker at a glance\n*************************************************************\nAt the top of your financial feed are your three balances. The Bank balance is what the balance should be in your account. The Pending balance is the difference between outstanding transactions and the Bank balance. The Lowest balance is what your lowest balance may be in the upcoming year. Tap the Lowest title to display the expected date of the lowest balance.\n\nAfter the balances is a forecast graph. This graph is the anticipated balances change over the upcoming year based on your budget. This is an easy way to know if your spending is trending up or down.\n\nThe last three sections are transactions. They are broken down into lists for pending, upcoming and past transactions. Pending transactions list income or expenses activities that you completed but it hasn’t reflected in your account yet. Once they have cleared your account, the transaction can be cleared in Green (swipe let on the transaction) and it moves to the Past 30 days’ section. The Past 30 Days’ section contains all the transactions that occurred in the last 30 days. Your whole account transaction history can be exported as an excel file for further evaluation by swiping left on an account in the settings menu. The upcoming section shows what transactions are coming up. Just swipe left on the transaction to pay early or wait for the scheduled date when the transaction automatically moves to the Pending section.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO?\n****************************\n- Know when it's safe to spend\n- Analyze your spending history\n- Never forget another bill again\n- Be budget aware even when you spend\n- Have confidence in controlling your money\n- Setup multiple budgets for different accounts\n\nDon’t avoid controlling your money because it seems too intimidating and scary because with Green it’s easy. Because of Green’s forecast capability, you can plan for unexpected expenses, pay off debt earlier and finally take control of your money. Once you’re in control of your money your stress level will go down. Live life in control."

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nAdding Machine features dual keypads with a total (*) key on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n====  Recent Press  =====\nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category for iPad.\n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key Adding Machine app.\"\n=================\n\n\nSpecifications:\n=================\n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine.\n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility.\n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history (full version)\n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float\n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use.\n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines\n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style)\n● Comprehensive set of help screens.\n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region).\n\n \n================\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calculator’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

After entering your debts in the application, you can analyze how the choice of payment strategy or different extra amounts helps you pay off your debts sooner, and save on the total interest paid.  Debt Strategy supports multiple strategies such as:\n\n- Minimum Payments Only\n- Lowest Balances First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n- Highest Interest Rate First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n\nDebt Strategy helps you to take control of your debts. Pick one debt, either one with the lowest balance or one with the highest interest rate, and focus on paying it off first by paying a little more than the minimum. This will shave months off your debt. With your other debts, continue paying just the minimum. After you finish paying off the first debt, move on to the 2nd debt per your strategy. Roll over the amount you paid each month from your first debt to pay off this one. You will pay off the second debt even more quickly. Continue this strategy until all your debts are paid.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Ability to enter debts and track debts.\n- Ability to identify the best pay-off strategy, and perform what-if analysis with different additional amounts and pay-off strategies\n- Graphical view of how the debts will be paid off\n- Pie/Bar charts for debt break down by category, or remaining balance\n- Monthly payment schedule for each debt\n- Ability to enter payments during the life of the loan, and accurately track remaining balances\n- Payment reminders so you can make your payments on time\n- Ability to override the home currency\n- Option to email a report\n- Password protection"

      "label": "Have you ever wondered what your money could be worth in 30 years if you saved it instead of spent it? Compound Interest answers that question by helping you calculate what your money could be worth if you saved it or invested it over time.\n\nImagine you started saving for retirement when you're just 15 instead of 40. Put away $100 bucks a week with 7% returns. By the time you hit retirement age you'd have over 2 million dollars stashed away. You might ask yourself: how, doing the quick math that's only saving $260,000? Well, that is where compound interest comes into play. Even though you only earned and saved a little over $250,000 you gained over $2,000,000 in compound interest. Pretty cool right?\n\nAlready have an end goal in mind? Instead solve for contribution amount, return rate, or length. Want to retire with $5,000,000 but aren't sure how much you need to be saving each month to reach that goal? Switch the mode to solve for contribution amount and it will automatically calculate that number.\n\nSo check out this awesome compound interest calculator that lets you see your gains broken up by year with a cool interactive graph, multiple tabs, and light/dark themes.\n\nNotable Features:\n- The ability to create additional tabs to allow you to calculate as many sets of data and outputs as you want.\n- Ability to solve for different values like total amount, length, contribution amount, or the return rate you might need to achieve your goals.\n- Tab References: You can now reference one tab's total balance in another's initial balance. This is great for scenarios where you want to change the contribution amount or return rate in future years. For example, you can now experiment with the scenario of contributing $500 for 10 years followed by $0 for the next 10 years, and see the effects of compound interest over a 20 year time period. To reference another tab just tap into the starting balance and you'll see a toolbar above the keyboard with tabs that can be referenced.\n- See data broken out by each year it's being compounded."

      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key Universal' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nThis universal version works with both iPhone and iPad. The iPad version features a full sized (1:1) keypad with TypeTone, a unique audio aid to help guide your finger back to the center of a key. The total (*) key (iPad or iPhone) can be on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine 10Key Univ Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n==== Recent Press ===== \nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category. \n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key for iPad.\" \n================= \n\n\nSpecifications: \n================= \n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine. \n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility. \n● TypeTone - a major innovation to aid accurate key entry using audio feedback (iPad version). \n● Full size (1:1) keyboard (iPad version). \n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history. \n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float \n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use. \n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines \n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style) \n● Comprehensive set of help screens. \n● 4 Orientations: Landscape Left/Right + Portrait (iPad version) \n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region). \n\n\n================ \n\nFAQ's \n\nQ1. What is the difference between this App, 'Adding Machine 10Key Universal', and 'Accountant Universal for iPad' in the App. Store.? \nA1. Both calculators are single-column adding machines or calculators with full-size (1:1) keypads and are optimized for the iPad User Interface. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calc’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works. \n\nQ2. Can I touch-type? \nA2. The iPad version comes as close to touch-typing as a touch-screen can be. v2.1 introduces TypeTone. With TypeTone, a key will guide your finger back to the center of a key with an audio tone. \n\nQ3. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape? \nA3. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers, split Add/Sub or Mul/Div groups. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA5. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

      "label": "What is the best age to start your Social Security benefits? What if you start at 62 with reduced benefits, but invest and get compound interest? Or is it a good idea for you to wait until 70 for increased benefits?\n\nThe Social Security Calculator is a powerful estimating tool that can answer these questions and help you plan for retirement.\n\n[ Features ]\n\n• Estimates the most profitable starting age for your benefits based on your income and life expectancy\n\n• Calculates your potential lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages so you can easily compare the results\n\n• Your date of birth and benefit amount at full retirement age are all you need to know (benefits at FRA can be found on your Social Security statement or by creating an account on SSA.gov)\n\n• Optionally include other monthly income, an interest rate for income, monthly expenses, and an interest rate for expenses\n\n• Optionally disable paying down expenses (potentially useful in situations when compounding income exceeds compounding expenses)\n\n• Detailed results are presented in interactive Summary, Spreadsheet, and Graph formats\n\n• Calculation inputs can be labeled and saved for quick retrieval and comparison\n\n• Robust in-app help via information buttons, getting started guide, glossary, and links to additional resources\n\n[ Interactive Results ]\n\n• Summary - a table of life expectancy ages with their most profitable starting ages for benefits. Rows can be expanded to show your estimated lifetime net income for every life expectancy age. The lifetime net income rows can be tapped to highlight the corresponding cell in the Spreadsheet.\n\n• Spreadsheet -  detailed spreadsheet format showing your estimated lifetime net income for all Social Security starting ages and life expectancy ages. Each lifetime net income cell can be tapped to show more detailed information. The differences in lifetime net income amounts can be easily examined for all benefit starting ages.\n\n• Graph - calculation results displayed as lines depicting estimated lifetime net income for each Social Security starting age. Clearly illustrates the differences in lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages. Any starting age line can be toggled on or off. Tapping a point on the graph will display more detailed information. Supports zooming to show increased granularity.\n\n[ Disclaimer ]\n\nWe have carefully followed the benefit rules from the Social Security Administration and have tested to ensure that our calculations are as accurate as possible.  However, since we are not affiliated with the SSA, this app is only intended to be used for reference.  Before making a retirement decision we strongly recommend reviewing SSA.gov and other resources for more information.

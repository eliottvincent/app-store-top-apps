      "label": "'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' behaves like a true '10 Key' or 'printing calculator' such as those made by Monroe, Casio, Sharp and others. A total is obtained by pressing the asterisk (*), operator entry is reversed, and percentages are obtained by multiplying and adding to a stream of numbers. PLEASE SEE THE 1ST FAQ BELOW.\n\nAdding Machine features dual keypads with a total (*) key on either the left or right side (Sharp or Canon style). \n\nAlso. Review & edit numbers, add or delete lines. Save & retrieve paper tape files. Export paper tape files to iBooks©, Dropbox©, Email or your favorite printing utility (see the FAQs).\n\nTry before you buy. Find our 'Adding Machine Lite' by Richard Silverman in the App Store. \n\n\n====  Recent Press  =====\nCurrently featured in iTunes \"What's Hot\" in the Finance Category for iPad.\n\nStrategic Finance (Tools of the Trade): \"If you're looking for a professional desk calculator that can give you full 10-key accounting functions with a tape you can name and save, edit, e-mail, or print, check out Interlocken's 10 Key Adding Machine app.\"\n=================\n\n\nSpecifications:\n=================\n● Behaves the same as a '10 Key' adding machine.\n● Export a PDF file to iBooks©, DropBox©, Email, or your favorite printing utility.\n● Select from a menu of keypad sounds.\n● 400 lines of paper tape history (full version)\n● 3 display formats: fixed, fix+, float\n● Save paper tapes to disk for later use.\n● Correct numbers, add comments, add/delete lines\n● Use your voice to dictate comments (iOS 7 and greater)\n● Two keypads offer the 'total' key on the left or right (Sharp or Canon style)\n● Comprehensive set of help screens.\n● International number formatting (Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format -> select region).\n\n \n================\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the difference between 'Adding Machine 10Key iPhone' and 'Accountant Calculator' in the App. Store.?\nA1. Both are single-column adding devices and both have iPad versions with full size 1:1 keyboards. '10 Key' behaves the same as a 10 Key Adding Machine with reversed operator entry while ‘Accountant Calculator’ supports the free chaining of +, -, x, /, %, √, 1/x and is easier to use if you are not familiar with how a '10-key' works.\n\nYou can also reference the following link:\nhttp://www.tenkeycalculators.com/addandsubtract.html\n\nQ2. Can I touch-type?\nA2. Checkout the iPad version with large (1:1) keyboards and several aids for touch-typing.\n\nQ3. How can I quickly clear the paper tape?\nA3. The quickest way is to double-tap the calculator's large \"i\" action icon to the left of the calculator's LCD display.\n\nQ4. How can I edit an incorrect number or add & delete lines from the paper tape?\nA4. Touch any line of the paper tape to go into edit mode. Touch the side controls: Add Line, Delete Line. You can also edit numbers. Press Done to return to Calculator mode.\n\nQ5. How can I have my 'total' key be on the right side?\nA5. Press the checkerboard icon on the left side of the paper tape until the keypad you want is displayed. There are three to choose from.\n\nQ6. Tell me about Email, Printing, and Exporting a Paper Tape. \nA6. From the Export dialog, select from: Email, Print, Copy or Open-In. Email includes a pdf attachment. Print requires an AirPrint capable printer. Open-In will cause a menu of 3rd party Apps to appear that can receive a hardcopy of your paper tape; for example, iBooks, DropBox, and 3rd party printer Apps for Brother, HP, Epson, Canon and more. With these print directly to a network reachable printer (even if it is NOT AirPrint capable)."

From collectible film cameras to '80s vintage shirts to a set of tools, flippers keep products from ending up in landfills while finding them new, loving homes.\n\nWith Margin is a straightforward yet effective profit and loss estimator providing anyone on the go quick access to determine a find as a possible hit or miss. Utilizing fixed or percentage-based costs, quickly enter your reasonably educated guess for the amount it could sell. Next, subtract shipping, item cost, marketplace fees, and payment processing fees (if applicable). If profitable based on your industry knowledge, you can quickly act upon it.\n\nTip: While using the Custom calculator, tap the percent (%) icon to turn the line item value into a percentage rather than a fixed cost; this is useful for percentage-based fees.\n\nThank you for downloading With Margin!"

Taxes App helps you to figure out the correct amount of Federal and State taxes to withhold from your paycheck.  If you are self-employed, it helps you to figure out estimated taxes.  If you are employed, self-employed, have investment income, etc., it helps figure out income taxes for that too!\n\nTaxes App is great for any Do-It-Yourself type of person and is also great for professionals assisting clients.  Taxes App gives you the ability to run income tax projections in seconds.  It’s also great if you want to learn more about different types of income, deductions, & tax credits and how those affect your tax bill.\n\nIncludes Tax Years 2023, 2022, & 2021.\n\nNote - States are slow to update their tax brackets.  If current-year state brackets are unavailable, prior-year brackets will be used until the state issues current-year brackets.\n\nFederal calculations include:\n- Ordinary federal income tax.\n- Self-employment tax.\n- Self-employment tax deduction. \n- Additional Medicare (Self-employment only).\n- Qualified business income deduction with threshold & phaseout.\n- Net investment income tax.\n- Child tax credit with phase-out.\n- Standard deduction.\n- Ability to manually add for-agi deductions.\n- Ability to manually add other tax credits.\n- Ability to manually add other taxes.\n- Ability to run withholding/estimated tax payments projections.\n\nState calculations include:\n- Ordinary state income tax.\n- Self-Employment Tax Deduction add-back - PA.\n- Standard deduction, personal exemption, dependent exemption (does not include phaseout, but a few states do not calculate these based on a low-income phaseout).\n- Federal QBI Deduction - CO, ID, & ND.\n- Federal 50% QBI Deduction - IA.\n- Federal Income Tax Deduction - IA.\n- Ability to manually add state deductions & state additions.\n- Ability to manually add other tax credits.\n- Ability to manually add other taxes.\n- Ability to run withholding/estimated tax payments projections.\n- Taxes App on most states calculates tax on state taxable income at ordinary state tax rates. This should overestimate taxes due if your state has favorable rates on certain types of income.\n\nTaxes App is brought to you by Adam Myrick, CPA, a solo developer.

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

Whether you pay monthly rent as a tenant, or whether you're a landlord trying to collect rent, you both may be trying to make ends meet. Sometimes we need help...and that's where this app comes into the picture.\n\nThe Defer My Pay app effortlessly guides you through 3 simple questions (while _never_ asking for, or collecting, personally identifiable information) and then instantly presents you with a customized deferred payment plan that works for both the debtor and the creditor (i.e. the one paying and the one collecting). You can even move back and forth through the questions and adjust as needed. This allows the people on both sides of the transaction get to keep the roof over their heads and food on their tables. It's a win-win.\n\nWe're in this together.\nEverything will be OK.\nLet's work something out."

      "label": "*** Discounted for a limited time ***\n\nAchieve financial freedom with Debt Snowball Pro! This easy-to-use app helps you eliminate debt using the “debt snowball” method that is taught and endorsed by many financial professionals. \n\nFeatured in Parade Magazine's Intelligence Report. (April 2012)\n\nFeatured in iTunes \"Top 20 apps in 2011 to improve your fitness and finances\"\n\nThe best Debt Snowball app in iTunes\n\nThis app is used and recommended by many financial advisors, firms, and banks.  Simply input your debts (including balance, interest rate, and monthly payment) and Debt Snowball Pro will help you select the best payoff method.\n\nUsing the debt snowball method of payment, once you pay off a debt, you’ll apply the previous payment to the next debt, resulting in a snowball effect as the amount paid toward your larger loans grows over time.\n\nYou can choose to pay off debts with higher interest rates first (to save money), or those with the lowest balances (for small, motivating successes along the way). Debt Snowball Pro shows you just how much money you’ll save by choosing these methods over making minimum payments.\n\nView our demonstration on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ4Ce7ujDxc\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n•Easy-to-use interface.\n•Password protection.\n•Ability to add and remove debts, update balances, and see when you will be debt-free.\n•Shows interest saved and debt payoff dates.\n•Detailed Payment Schedule spreadsheet, showing effects of applying snowball payments to individual debts.\n•Ability to quickly make payments on individual loans.\n•iCloud support so you can easily share data between devices.\n•Progress bars to show and encourage progress.\n•Custom notification to remind you when each bill is due.\n•Ability to share on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nNOTE:\nThis also makes a great gift to family and friends.  Click the down arrow on the left (next to Buy App) and choose \"Gift This App\".\n\nCOMMENTS:\nPlease send your comments, suggestions, and questions to matt.l.king@comcast.net.\n\nREVIEWS:\n\"This is an excellent App! One of the most important keys to success when trying to get out of debt is ‘Concentration’ on the goal.  The Debt Snowball is a goal. Having the information readily available to look at may keep more people motivated towards attaining their goal of becoming debt free.\"\n- enemyofdebt.com\n\n\"My husband and I both use Debt Snowball Pro.  The peace of mind that I got from having a plan set and seeing the \"end date goal\" is worth every penny.  Before using Debt Snowball there was a constant nagging feeling in the back of my head that kept me from ever being completely relaxed.  Now, with the goal in site I feel so much better about our situation.  If you have several loans you should not hesitate, get the app.  Follow the steps and get your own peace of mind and start working toward freedom from debt\"\n- AquababeJen\n\n\"Great app to manage and control your debts.  Simple to use and understand and can save you a ton of real money\"\n-casey_tx\n\nIf you like this app you will also like our other apps:\nMortgage Calculator +\nLoan Calculator - What if?\nRandom Fun Facts\nScripture of the Day - (NASB Version)\nToday in American History\nRandom Crazy Illusions\nTravel Bingo & Blackout\nGrocery Bingo\nBizarre Holidays"

You can enter your device into sleep mode, exit the App, or even completely power off your device and whenever you open \"Time to Money\" again, it will update your earnings from the time you tapped the Start button to the current time and continue to calculate each second! On a break? No worries. Just tap the Pause button, and when you are ready to continue the job, tap the Resume button. Finished with a job? Nice work! Tap the End button to end the job and save a log! These logs can be viewed at any moment and contain information about that job. In addition, you can also set a goal that you wish to reach. Your goal can be changed at any time. There is also a \"Time to Money\" App for Apple Watch, where you can watch your earnings grow right on your wrist! And better yet, the Apple Watch version of the App can easily be accessed via a Watch face complication (there are multiple complication styles to choose from). Tap the complication, and see your earnings at a glance from within the App! The Apple Watch version of the App is also linked with the iPhone version of the App, ensuring that if you tap Start on one device, it will begin on the other device as well! When you tap the End button on the Apple Watch version of the App, a log is sent to your Phone. Oh yeah, and one more thing! After tapping the Start or Resume button, you will receive hourly notifications that let you know how much money you have made so far to help motivate you while you work!"

      "label": "Print checks and their cover letter on the same page directly from your iOS device with this easy to use check printing application : enter the order (payee), the Dollar amount, and voila ! \n\nCheck Writer Plus will automatically generate the word amount so you do not have to worry about spelling it out. You can also print blank checks to take with you. \n\nUse as many bank accounts as you want. Each will have its own account number, user information and bank information.\n\nKeep track of all your expenses and deposits with the built-in electronic record book (Register). Balance is calculated automatically. Reconcile with your bank statement just as easily as you would with a paper record book. Save, load data and settings to use different accounts. Set different fonts to print your name on checks.\n\nCheck Writer Plus, will sign your checks automatically with your own picture. \n\nYou can add your logo next to your name and address.\n\nAll elements of the check can be moved to perfectly fit your needs, and you can decide which elements will be printed (convenient for pre-printed paper). \n\nPrint as many blank checks as you want to use them like regular checkbooks.\n\nExtremely accurate MICR E13B technology is used to print special characters at the bottom of checks so they are recognized by bank processing. This font is used daily by regional and nationals banks.\n\nThe Register can be printed in spreadsheet format. Search easily throughout the register content: date, number, memo, amount.\n\nPrint immediately or later, on top, middle, bottom, or three checks per page. Checks can be printed on regular letter-size paper, plain white or color, as well as on professional looking check refill paper available from fine office supply stores. Also, Versacheck #1000, #1001, #1002, #3000, and Personal # 3001.\n\nQuickBooks® or Quicken® paper stock can be used as well. Likewise, using the Blank Checks feature without lines, you can print check paper for QuickBooks® and Quicken®\n\nThe height of checks can be set in Preferences, to accommodate non standard pre-printed paper.\n\nPrinting can be nudged horizontally and vertically very precisely.\n\nWiFi and Google Print are supported.\n\nIMPORTANT :\n----------------\n\nCheck Writer Plus is meant for personal productivity. For uses like payroll or other corporate use, better look towards other, specialized applications.\n\nAs mentioned above, the MICR E13B font used in this application has been purchased by regional and national banks for their own use, after stringent tests. We are absolutely confident they will perform perfectly when used correctly. However, it is necessary to strictly follow these principles :\n\n1 - It is paramount never to use \"scale to fit\". Printing must be done at 100% to insure the MICR printing conforms to standard.\n\n2 - MICR Toner (magnetic ink) is mandatory to meet the American Banking Association MICR E13B standard and U.S. law (Check 21 Act). MICR E13B printing complies with ANSI X9.27-1995, ANSI X9.100-160-1-2009, and Canadian CPA006 standards.\n\nAlthough many banks today use Optical Character Recognition which accepts any ink, some are equipped with readers that require magnetic ink, and will be suspicious of checks printed with ordinary ink.\n\nMICR toner is indistinguishable of regular black toner, and can be acquired from fine office supply stores, Amazon, or other Internet toner vendors.\n\nIf you still have questions, or if you encounter any difficulties using this app, please use the support link to contact us, we will do all we can to help right away."

The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

      "label": "No ADs or In-App Purchases. \n\nFor any issues please contact us at DIYIMPLEMENTER@GMAIL.COM\n\nThis Intrinsic Value Calculator is based on Warren Buffett \"Ten Cap Price\" otherwise known as \"Owner Earnings\" calculation. Buffett is calling Owner Earnings: \"the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses.\" \n\nPer Warren Buffett Value Investment Theory the buy decision should be based on several factors: \n\n1. Company must have competitive advantage... \n2. Company performed admirably in the past 10 years, recovered after market correction(s) and recession(s)... \n3. Company must have long term prospects - be relevant in 10 years from now... \n4. Company's market price should be 20-30% less than calculated intrinsic value - margin of safety price. \n\nThe logical question you would ask is how is it possible for such a good company to have the market price 20-30% bellow intrinsic value? The answer is: YES it's possible due to various reasons. The potential reasons could include: bad news about the company, company's industry is out of market favor, market is in correction or recession... \n\nWarren Buffett indicator -> the historical ratio of Total Market Cap over GDP is currently at 195%. Meaning we are in the biggest Stock Market BUBBLE in the history of the world!!! \n\nThis is undeniable proof that we are in the Market Bubble that is bigger than \"DOT-COM Bubble\" of 2001 or \"Housing Bubble\" of 2008. It's just a matter of time before this Market Bubble will inevitably POP presenting an opportunity for Value Investors to buy their favorite stocks for less than intrinsic value! But in order to buy your favorite stocks for less than intrinsic value you need to know what this intrinsic value is.  This is when our Intrinsic Value Calculator comes handy. You can calculate, store, reload and compare intrinsic value with market price anywhere and anytime, and all you need is your phone and our application.\n\nYou can read more about Value Investing online. We would recommend - \"The Intelligent Investor\" book written by Benjamin Graham - Warren Buffett's teacher and the founder of Value Investment Theory.\n\nThe goal of this application is to help value investors with calculation of intrinsic value. Most of the values required for calculation could be found on company's latest annual report. Annual reports can be found on company's website in investor relations section. Values missing in annual report could be found on GOOGLE. \n\nEach edit field has a corresponding help button to explain the meaning and location of the data on company's annual report.\n\n\"Examples\" button would display actual values for Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Alibaba, Baidu and all FAANG stocks: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet’s Google. Based on the calculated intrinsic values representing the real value of these stocks we can conclude this Stock Market BUBBLE would be called \"FAANG Bubble\".\n\n\"Save Data\" button would save data to your phone storage at \"IntrinsicValueData\" folder as comma separated \".CSV\" file.\n\n\"Load Saved Data\" button would display list of files \".CSV\" saved at \"IntrinsicValueData\" folder. \n\n\".CSV\" files in \"IntrinsicValueData\" folder could be copied to PC and loaded to MS Excel for further analyses. \n\nYou can use this calculator literally anywhere, after all, it comes with your phone… It’s easy to use, all you need is to find and load annual report to your phone using internet browser as PDF file, search for required values, cut and paste values to the calculator and press Calculate button. Now you know if the stock is the bargain or overvalued based on company’s annual report and not on subjective opinion of various market analysts who could be biased based on their own long or short position on particular stock…\n\nThis method doesn’t take growth into account. \n\nIf you like the app we would really appreciate your positive review.\n\n© 2022 Best Implementer LLC"

Rule of thumb is to enter 1 for yourself and add another 1 for each additional dependant in your household. Paid wages (year-to-date) are assumed to be 0, therefore a minor descrepancy with your actual paycheck is expected at the end of the year.\n\nTo produce the most accurate paycheck calculation please upgrade to Payrollguru app, that considers the number of allowances and paid year-to-date wages, and allows for additional pre-tax and post-tax deductions.\n\nPaycheck Calculator can be used by employees and employers in the US to verify accuracy of actual paychecks. Can email result to any person. \n\nGreat tool to compare take-home amounts after taxes in different states and/or in different pay scenarios, such as married vs. single, weekly vs. monthly. Helps to plan your budget and future spending. \n\nEnjoy using it and please review it the app if you like it."

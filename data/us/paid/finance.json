We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

Whether you pay monthly rent as a tenant, or whether you're a landlord trying to collect rent, you both may be trying to make ends meet. Sometimes we need help...and that's where this app comes into the picture.\n\nThe Defer My Pay app effortlessly guides you through 3 simple questions (while _never_ asking for, or collecting, personally identifiable information) and then instantly presents you with a customized deferred payment plan that works for both the debtor and the creditor (i.e. the one paying and the one collecting). You can even move back and forth through the questions and adjust as needed. This allows the people on both sides of the transaction get to keep the roof over their heads and food on their tables. It's a win-win.\n\nWe're in this together.\nEverything will be OK.\nLet's work something out."

      "label": "Print checks and their cover letter on the same page directly from your iOS device with this easy to use check printing application : enter the order (payee), the Dollar amount, and voila ! \n\nCheck Writer Plus will automatically generate the word amount so you do not have to worry about spelling it out. You can also print blank checks to take with you. \n\nUse as many bank accounts as you want. Each will have its own account number, user information and bank information.\n\nKeep track of all your expenses and deposits with the built-in electronic record book (Register). Balance is calculated automatically. Reconcile with your bank statement just as easily as you would with a paper record book. Save, load data and settings to use different accounts. Set different fonts to print your name on checks.\n\nCheck Writer Plus, will sign your checks automatically with your own picture. \n\nYou can add your logo next to your name and address.\n\nAll elements of the check can be moved to perfectly fit your needs, and you can decide which elements will be printed (convenient for pre-printed paper). \n\nPrint as many blank checks as you want to use them like regular checkbooks.\n\nExtremely accurate MICR E13B technology is used to print special characters at the bottom of checks so they are recognized by bank processing. This font is used daily by regional and nationals banks.\n\nThe Register can be printed in spreadsheet format. Search easily throughout the register content: date, number, memo, amount.\n\nPrint immediately or later, on top, middle, bottom, or three checks per page. Checks can be printed on regular letter-size paper, plain white or color, as well as on professional looking check refill paper available from fine office supply stores. Also, Versacheck #1000, #1001, #1002, #3000, and Personal # 3001.\n\nQuickBooks® or Quicken® paper stock can be used as well. Likewise, using the Blank Checks feature without lines, you can print check paper for QuickBooks® and Quicken®\n\nThe height of checks can be set in Preferences, to accommodate non standard pre-printed paper.\n\nPrinting can be nudged horizontally and vertically very precisely.\n\nWiFi and Google Print are supported.\n\nIMPORTANT :\n----------------\n\nCheck Writer Plus is meant for personal productivity. For uses like payroll or other corporate use, better look towards other, specialized applications.\n\nAs mentioned above, the MICR E13B font used in this application has been purchased by regional and national banks for their own use, after stringent tests. We are absolutely confident they will perform perfectly when used correctly. However, it is necessary to strictly follow these principles :\n\n1 - It is paramount never to use \"scale to fit\". Printing must be done at 100% to insure the MICR printing conforms to standard.\n\n2 - MICR Toner (magnetic ink) is mandatory to meet the American Banking Association MICR E13B standard and U.S. law (Check 21 Act). MICR E13B printing complies with ANSI X9.27-1995, ANSI X9.100-160-1-2009, and Canadian CPA006 standards.\n\nAlthough many banks today use Optical Character Recognition which accepts any ink, some are equipped with readers that require magnetic ink, and will be suspicious of checks printed with ordinary ink.\n\nMICR toner is indistinguishable of regular black toner, and can be acquired from fine office supply stores, Amazon, or other Internet toner vendors.\n\nIf you still have questions, or if you encounter any difficulties using this app, please use the support link to contact us, we will do all we can to help right away."

      "label": "This app was designed to aid you to determine how much debt you could afford compared to your existing income. This app will tell you the ratio between your current income and  debt.\n\nWhat is a debt-to-income ratio?\n\nDebt to income ratio (DTI) is the amount of your total monthly bills divided by how much money you make a month. It allows lenders to determine the likelihood that you would be able to repay a loan.\n\nFor instance, if you pay $2,000 a month for a mortgage, $300 a month for an auto loan and $700 a month for the rest of your bills, you have a total monthly debt of $3,000.\n\nIf your gross monthly income is $7,000, you divide that into the debt ($3,000 / 7,000) and your debt-to-income ratio is 42.8%.\n\nMost lenders would like your debt-to-income ratio to be under 35%. However, you can receive a qualified mortgage with as high as a 43% debt-to-income ratio.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Board, the household debt service payments and financial obligations as a percentage of disposable personal income was 10.1% in the first quarter of 2017. That is down from the high of 18.1 in December of 2009.\n\nThe ratio is best figured on a monthly basis. For example, if your monthly take-home pay is $2,000 and you pay $400 per month in debt payment for loans and credit cards, your debt-to-income ratio is 20 percent ($400 divided by $2,000 = .20).\n\nPut another way, the ratio is a percent of your income that is pre-promised to debt payments. If your ratio is 40%, that means you have pre-promised 40% of your future income to pay debts.\n\nWhy Debt-To-Income Ratio % Matters\n\nWhile there is no law establishing a definitive debt-to-income ratio that requires lenders to make a loan, there are some accepted standards, especially as it regard federal home loans.\n\nFor example, if you qualify for a VA loan, the department of Veteran Affairs guidelines suggest a 41% debt-to-income ratio. FHA loans will allow for a ratio of 43%. It is possible to get a VA or FHA loan with a higher ratio, but only when there compensating factors.\n\nThe ratio needed for conventional loans varies, depending on the lending institution. Most banks rely on the 43% figure for debt-to-income, but it could be as high as 50%, depending on factors like income and credit card debt. Larger lenders, with large assets, are more likely to accept consumers with a high income-to-debt ratio, but only if they have a personal relationship with the customer or believe there is enough income to cover all debts.\n\nRemember, evidence shows that the higher the ratio, the more likely the borrower is going to have problems paying."

The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

After entering your debts in the application, you can analyze how the choice of payment strategy or different extra amounts helps you pay off your debts sooner, and save on the total interest paid.  Debt Strategy supports multiple strategies such as:\n\n- Minimum Payments Only\n- Lowest Balances First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n- Highest Interest Rate First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n\nDebt Strategy helps you to take control of your debts. Pick one debt, either one with the lowest balance or one with the highest interest rate, and focus on paying it off first by paying a little more than the minimum. This will shave months off your debt. With your other debts, continue paying just the minimum. After you finish paying off the first debt, move on to the 2nd debt per your strategy. Roll over the amount you paid each month from your first debt to pay off this one. You will pay off the second debt even more quickly. Continue this strategy until all your debts are paid.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Ability to enter debts and track debts.\n- Ability to identify the best pay-off strategy, and perform what-if analysis with different additional amounts and pay-off strategies\n- Graphical view of how the debts will be paid off\n- Pie/Bar charts for debt break down by category, or remaining balance\n- Monthly payment schedule for each debt\n- Ability to enter payments during the life of the loan, and accurately track remaining balances\n- Payment reminders so you can make your payments on time\n- Ability to override the home currency\n- Option to email a report\n- Password protection"

      "label": "What is the best age to start your Social Security benefits? What if you start at 62 with reduced benefits, but invest and get compound interest? Or is it a good idea for you to wait until 70 for increased benefits?\n\nThe Social Security Calculator is a powerful estimating tool that can answer these questions and help you plan for retirement.\n\n[ Features ]\n\n• Estimates the most profitable starting age for your benefits based on your income and life expectancy\n\n• Calculates your potential lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages so you can easily compare the results\n\n• Your date of birth and benefit amount at full retirement age are all you need to know (benefits at FRA can be found on your Social Security statement or by creating an account on SSA.gov)\n\n• Optionally include other monthly income, an interest rate for income, monthly expenses, and an interest rate for expenses\n\n• Optionally disable paying down expenses (potentially useful in situations when compounding income exceeds compounding expenses)\n\n• Detailed results are presented in interactive Summary, Spreadsheet, and Graph formats\n\n• Calculation inputs can be labeled and saved for quick retrieval and comparison\n\n• Robust in-app help via information buttons, getting started guide, glossary, and links to additional resources\n\n[ Interactive Results ]\n\n• Summary - a table of life expectancy ages with their most profitable starting ages for benefits. Rows can be expanded to show your estimated lifetime net income for every life expectancy age. The lifetime net income rows can be tapped to highlight the corresponding cell in the Spreadsheet.\n\n• Spreadsheet -  detailed spreadsheet format showing your estimated lifetime net income for all Social Security starting ages and life expectancy ages. Each lifetime net income cell can be tapped to show more detailed information. The differences in lifetime net income amounts can be easily examined for all benefit starting ages.\n\n• Graph - calculation results displayed as lines depicting estimated lifetime net income for each Social Security starting age. Clearly illustrates the differences in lifetime net income for all benefit starting ages. Any starting age line can be toggled on or off. Tapping a point on the graph will display more detailed information. Supports zooming to show increased granularity.\n\n[ Disclaimer ]\n\nWe have carefully followed the benefit rules from the Social Security Administration and have tested to ensure that our calculations are as accurate as possible.  However, since we are not affiliated with the SSA, this app is only intended to be used for reference.  Before making a retirement decision we strongly recommend reviewing SSA.gov and other resources for more information. (The app links to several useful resources in Help > Additional Resources.)\n\nAlso please be aware that this app currently does not calculate spousal benefits or survivor benefits.  If you would like us to add this functionality or have any other ideas to improve the app please let us know.\n\n[ Credits ]\n\n• App Design / Development - Denton Kollar\n• Original Concept / Consulting - Paul Cichocki"

      "label": "\"5 stars - This app is great.  Very Quick. Would highly recommend\". See more in customer reviews.\n\nMathU 12D, the Deluxe Financial RPN Calculator, is written from the ground up to behave exactly like and surpass the classic HP-12C.\n\nMathU 12D uses the same RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) entry system and supports the same mathematical functions as the HP-12C. In fact, if you are familiar with the HP-12C you will be able to use MathU 12D right away.\n\nMade by Creative Creek, LLC.  We have been making calculators for mobile devices for over 20 years. Also check out MathU RPN, our advanced scientific and financial RPN calculator.\n\nMathU 12D adds some big improvements over the original HP-12C:\n\n1) Visible Financial Registers -- The values of the financial registers are displayed prominently above the associated buttons. This allows you to quickly verify that the loan parameters are correct and builds confidence in the results.\n\n2) Computation Speed -- You will be amazed how quickly MathU 12D produces results.  Even complicated calculations like the determination of interest rate, IRR or NPV are finished in a fraction of a second.\n\n3) Two line display -- A two line display can be chosen so that the x and y register values are always visible. You can immediately see results and verify input values.\n\n4) Visible Programming -- Program lines are displayed using the function name instead of the key pad location.  This makes reading and writing MathU 12D programs easier.\n\n5) 20 Registers unaffected by programs - The registers are not shared with the program space so you can create up to 99 line programs without sacrificing any storage space.\n\nDocumentation for MathU 12D is available from within the app.  All the functions work exactly the same as on the HP-12C, so if you are familiar with the HP-12C you will be able to use MathU 12D right away.\n\nFeatures\n\n- Fast and accurate computation based on \n   IEEE double precision (up to 16 digits)\n- 5 financial registers (visible on the main screen)\n- 20 storage registers\n- Programmable with up to 99 program steps\n- Program steps show function name directly\n- Two line display\n- FIX, SCI, and ENG display modes\n- Access to on-line documentation\n- Settings screen\n- Thousands and decimal separators follow international format settings\n- Copy and paste support\n- Support for  iOS 8.x or higher.\n- Support for iPhone and iPad\n\nFunctions Supported:\n\n- Time value of money (N,i,PV,PMT,FV)\n- Net Present Value (NPV)\n- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\n- Simple interest\n- Cash Flows (CF0, CFj, Nj)\n- Bond pricing and yield (PRICE, YTM)\n- Depreciation based on \n   - Straight line (SL)\n   - Sum-Of-the-Years-Digits (SOYD)\n   - Declining balance (DB)\n- Date in future (DATE) or days between dates (DYS)\n- Statistics mean, std, wieghted mean, factorial\n- Percent, percent change and percent of total\n- Linear curve fitting (x,r y,r)\n- Scientific functions (y^x, e^x, sqrt, 1/x, ln)\n- Integer and fractional parts (INTG, FRAC)"

Rule of thumb is to enter 1 for yourself and add another 1 for each additional dependant in your household. Paid wages (year-to-date) are assumed to be 0, therefore a minor descrepancy with your actual paycheck is expected at the end of the year.\n\nTo produce the most accurate paycheck calculation please upgrade to Payrollguru app, that considers the number of allowances and paid year-to-date wages, and allows for additional pre-tax and post-tax deductions.\n\nPaycheck Calculator can be used by employees and employers in the US to verify accuracy of actual paychecks. Can email result to any person. \n\nGreat tool to compare take-home amounts after taxes in different states and/or in different pay scenarios, such as married vs. single, weekly vs. monthly. Helps to plan your budget and future spending. \n\nEnjoy using it and please review it the app if you like it."

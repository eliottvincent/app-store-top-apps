It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful.

This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view.

Then you probably own a circulator or a similar device. To start, a zip-bag, a cooking pot and a thermometer is all you need. Many Sous Vide recipes work without special equipment. But you will need good advice!\n\nSous Vide has been adopted in professional kitchens for producing precise and consistent results. The Sous Vide method produces perfectly cooked food with outstanding flavor. Its success in high-end cuisine changed the culinary world. With a few starting tips anyone can use this technique. Step-by-step tutorials and Sous Vide timers (mini-recipes with an alarm) help you along the way.\n\nIdeas, suggestions or anything you would like to change? Contact us with your feedback on UserVoice!\n\nThe time for a piece of meat to reach a core temperature can be calculated. A formula using thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and surface heat transfer calculates the time such shapes as cylinders, cubes and steaks need to acquire a certain core temperature. Consider the PolyScience Toolbox App or Douglas Baldwin’s formulas for calculating pasteurization times.\n\nBut food is never an exact geometrical shape and waiting for an extra hour for a piece to reach an additional half a degree is impractical. Adjustments for speed and efficiency improve the Sous Vide experience. We have tested Sous Vide recommendations that work and tutorials that make the first steps easy - for professionals and home cooks alike!\n\nSous Vide - no other cooking method gives you so much control!\n\nDon’t get the Anova Pro or the new Anova Precision Cooker (2019) as these devices are no longer equipped with Bluetooth!"

If paired correctly, your drink will compliment your food and add to your enjoyment. \nWe used the experience gained running delipair.com food-wine pairing website since 2015 to create ‘Delipair - Food and Wine’. Thanks to the advances in Machine Intelligence and increase of processing power available for mobile devices we were able to create an offline application more robust and versatile than server based solution behind delipair.com website.\n\nDelipair's digital sommelier engine automatically makes recommendation by creating aromatic fingerprint for your food and assessing the strength of aromatic bridge between food and each wine it knows.\n\nTo create food aromatic fingerprint Delipair's digital sommelier uses knowledge gained through (machine) learning ingredients and aromatic molecules of 1.3 million recipes from cuisines all around the world. That way you can simply enter a dish name straight from the restaurant menu or online cooking website and Delipair's digital sommelier will decipher its aromatic fingerprint. It works with ingredient names, or mix of dish names and ingredients as well.\n\nAromatic fingerprints of wines were developed in our laboratory, by scientific analysis of hundreds of wines fitting wine profiles reflecting multiple grape varieties, vinification methods and terroirs of wine regions. For this analysis we used gas chromatography (and we had more fun then scientists from CSI movies doing this).\n\nBased on our research of online wine shops we created a list of profiles to cover most popular wines on the market, and added a few odd but interesting wines we loved the most.\n\nGrape varieties available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nCabernet Sauvignon, Carmernere, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Corvina, Gamay, Grenache, Merlot, Malbec, Molinara, Nebbiolo, Nero d’Avola, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Primitivo, Riesling, Rondinella, Sangiovese, Sauvignon Blanc, Shiraz, Syrah, Tempranillo, Viognier, Zinfandel. \n\nWine countries available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nArgentina, Australia, Chile, France, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, USA\n\nTraditional wine types and regions available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nAmarone, Barbaresco, Barolo, Beaujolais (Villages, Cru), Bolgheri (Super Tuscans), Bordeaux (Left Bank), Bordeaux (Right Bank), Brunello di Montalcino, Chablis, Chianti (Classico, Riserva), Cote d’Or, Cotes du Rhone, Passo Doble, Pouilly Fuisse, Pouilly Fume, Petit Chablis, Prosecco, Rioja (Joven, Crianza, Reserva, Gran Reserva), Spatlese (Riesling), Valpolicella (Classico, Ripasso), Vino Nobile de Montepulciano\n\nIt was our goal to make Delipair's digital sommelier as easy and friendly to use as possible. This application works 100% offline. Therefore you can get the recommendation instantly, without the need of WiFi or cellular data plan and without waiting for a server to respond. \n\nWe also value your privacy, therefore we don't collect any data you enter into our application. \n\nLast, but not least, when you buy 'Delipair - Food and Wine' application you instantly get access to all the features and future updates.\n\nWe do hope our application will enhance your dining experience.

We'd love to help you get cooking!***\n\n#1 Food & Drink App and featured as one of Apple's \"Best New Apps\"!\n\nIt’s the Webby Award-winning app from Michelle Tam and Henry Fong, the James Beard Award nominated creators of Nom Nom Paleo—now available for both iPad and iPhone! Michelle and Henry’s Saveur Award winning food blog and New York Times bestselling cookbook are just the tip of the iceberg—this newly updated app makes cooking even more fun and inspirational, and takes all the guesswork out of cooking. Plus, now that the Nom Nom Paleo app’s available for iPhone, you can take these nomtastic recipes with you anywhere!\n\nFeatures:\n \n● Over 145 simple, tantalizing recipes, all free of gluten, soy, and refined sugar, sortable by food category, searchable by ingredients and category—the vast majority of which are approved for the Whole30® nutritional re-set program. You’ll find lots of recipes that are exclusive to this app, and not available on the Nom Nom Paleo website or cookbook. \n\n● More recipes are being added regularly! You won’t have to wait until future app updates—new recipes can now be added automatically to the app on your device!\n\n● More than 2,000 stunning, high-resolution photos showing every step of the cooking process.\n\n● Fun and visually-engaging new user interface and design, including a home display that allows you to quickly scroll through and visually select recipes.\n\n● Simple-to-follow instructions, including tips, shortcuts, and information about food and techniques.\n\n● An interactive, email-friendly grocery list that syncs across devices and makes food shopping a breeze.\n\n● An extensive “Paleo 101” primer that explains the benefits of the “caveman” diet and provides resources for more information about ancestral health and nutrition.\n\n● A Whole30-friendly 30-day sample meal plan with links to recipes.\n\n● An in-depth shopping guide with product reviews and links to sources for cooking tools and ingredients.\n\n● The ability to bookmark recipes, create a personalized category of favorite recipes, and add notes.\n\n● A “constant-on” function to prevent the screen from dimming while you cook.\n  \n● The ability to email complete recipes and shopping lists.\n\nPraise for Nom Nom Paleo:\n\n● The “Martha Stewart of Paleo.” –The New York Times\n\n● “Oddly provocative.” –Christopher Kimball of America’s Test Kitchen\n\n● “A must-have app.” –AppCraver\n\n● “Brilliantly designed.” –Apps Magazine\n \n● “Visually stunning.” –Gear Diary\n\n● “Always popping with flavor.” –The Kitchn\n\n● “Truly extraordinary.” –Michael Ruhlman, James Beard Award-winning food writer\n \nMessage from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:\n\nHey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!\n\nThis “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.\n \nBut that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.\n \nMy hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!\n \n● App development by Y Media Labs ●"

When you know a ratio, you don’t know a recipe, you know 1,000.  And this application does all the calculating for you.\n\n “Cooking, like so many other creative endeavors is defined by relationships.  For instance, knowing exactly how much flour to put into a loaf of bread isn’t nearly as useful as understanding the relationship between the flour and the water, or fat, or salt.  That relationship is defined by a ‘ratio’ and having a ratio in hand is like having a secret decoder ring that frees you from the tyranny of recipes. ….Michael Ruhlman, in handing us mortals a power better suited to the gods, has changed the balance of kitchen power forever.” —Good Eats host Alton Brown\n\n\nWhat You Get:\n\n--THE 32 CRITICAL RATIOS that form the backbone of the culinary arts, with instructions: doughs, batters, meat preparations, custards, sauces (pasta dough and pizza dough, sponge cake and pancakes, fritters and crepes, stocks and sauces, crème caramel and chocolate sauce.\n\n--A CALCULATOR that figures out how much of each ingredient you need, no matter how many or how few people you want to serve.\n\n--An OUNCES-TO-GRAMS CONVERTER (ratios work no matter what unit you choose to use!).\n\n--DELICIOUS VARIATIONS FOR RECIPES on all the ratios, ideas for the creation of new dishes according to your tastes.\n\n--An easy way to STORE YOUR OWN RECIPES and notes that you’ve created from the basic ratios.\n\n--Quick fun ways to SHARE what your cooking with your fellow cooks, on Facebook and on Twitter.\n\n--Ratios is also a great way to understand and TWEAK YOUR OWN RECIPES, to help you make your pancakes even fluffier, your pizza dough crisper, your crème brulee richer."

I looked at several different apps which claimed to do similar kind of thing, but none had depth of functionality, nor the ease of use and streamlined interface of this one.\" — littlesquidge, UK.\n\n***** \"Best cooking timer I can find, with clear sequential steps throughout the whole process!\" — Midamoor, UK.\n\n***** \"It does one thing and one thing well and is probably the best 'kitchen' timer on the App Store for cooking.\" — Orca1910, UK.\n\n***** \"Excellent app, very simple to set up and has multiple stages built in. Visually clear and perfect for a big meal like Christmas.\" — BT2203, Ireland.\n\n\nIf you would like more information please visit https://hacknicity.com/easycookingtimer where you can read the User Guide and a Tutorial to get a feel for how the app works before you buy."

      "label": "How many of us struggle with \"kitchen math?\" The Kitchen Calculator PRO app makes cooking and measuring so much easier. Kitchen Calculator PRO does all the recipe conversions for you, and makes it simple to scale recipes up (or down) to change the number of servings the recipe yields. With Kitchen Calculator PRO you can:\n\n1.Quickly scale your recipes (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using fractions!\n\n2.Convert ingredients from weight to volume, and vice versa ( cups to grams, ounces,  etc. )\n\n3.Supports several volume, weight, distance, and temperature conversions\n\n4.Enter amounts and view results in standard cooking fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc )\n\n5.Grow a database with your favorite ingredients! (see weight to volume )\n\n\nUSER COMMENTS\n\n***** Exactly what I've been looking for! - \"I just tested this out on a new cake recipe and it was simple, easy and accurate. The cake came out *perfect*!\" by njanehair.\n\n***** Yippee, perfection! - \"I cook 3 meals a day for my toddler and am always needing to scale recipes down so I'm not making ridiculous amounts of food\" by Cindi M.\n\n***** Brilliant - \"For a cook trained in the metric system, this tool is a dream come true\" by BeeDiana.\n\n\nSCALE YOUR RECIPES\n\nEasily convert and scale recipes in an instant. Doubling a recipe (or cutting a recipe in half) is simpler than ever before, with all the most common units of cooking measurement right at your fingertips. \n\n\nWEIGHT TO VOLUME CONVERSIONS\n\nWhat is so special about weight to volume conversions?\n\nWhen converting from weight to volume it is important to take into account the ingredient you are converting. As you know, a cup of sugar does not weigh the same as a cup of rice. Furthermore, a particular brand of sugar may weigh different from another.  This is all made easy with Kitchen Calculator PRO.\n\nSo, how does Kitchen Calculator handle weight to volume conversions?\n\n1.It comes with a database of common ingredients based on weight figures from the USDA (US Department of Agriculture).\n\n2.It allows you to quickly enter and save your own ingredient weight for more precise conversions.  In many cases, you can enter the values right off the product label, using fractions!  \n\n3.Kitchen Calculator will remember any saved ingredient information for future conversions.\n\nNOTE: The preset ingredient list is based on USDA  (US Department of Agriculture) figures and are approximate values. They may differ from the ingredients you use. For precise calculations we recommend entering the weights for your ingredients and, whenever possible using a scale.\n\nINGREDIENT DATA SOURCE\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 2007. USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 21.

Determine your current altitude (or let it be determined by GPS), tell your iPhone if you kept your eggs  in the freezer or at room temperature and how you would like to have your eggs – soft-boiled, hard-boiled or something in-between.\n\nPlace your eggs in a single layer in a saucepan. Add enough cold water to just cover the eggs. Bring them to a rapid boil over high heat and start the countdown. The iPhone will signal when the eggs are done. The attraction: The egg spy lets you see the changes inside your boiling egg!\n\nFeatures:\n\n-the formula for the perfect egg-timer is based on physical experiments and studies\n\n- Egg-size can be adjusted to the nearest millimetre (inch): Simply place the egg on the iPhone scale and set the size with your fingertip.  It doesn’t get any more accurate than this. \n\n- Automatic change of measurement units between inch or millimeter and fahrenheit or celsisu, depending on language and international settings.\n\n- determine and enter your altitude manually or let it be determined by GPS automatically.\n- The egg-spy shows you the inside of your egg during the cooking progress"

      "label": "**UPDATED PRICE: NOW ONLY $4.99 FOR A LIMITED TIME! **\n\nEnjoy all of the great content from The Oxford Companion to Beer in this reference app, which includes popular terms, search, daily definitions, and more.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to Beer book won 1st Place Winner of the 2012 Gourmand Award for Best in the World in the Beer category.\n\nFor millennia, beer has been a favorite beverage in cultures across the globe. After water and tea, it is the most popular drink in the world, and it is at the center of a $450 billion industry. \n\nEdited by Garrett Oliver, the James Beard Winner for Outstanding Wine, Beer, or Spirits Professional, this is the first major reference work to investigate the history and vast scope of beer. The Oxford Companion to Beer features more than 1,100 A-Z entries written by 166 of the world's most prominent beer experts. Attractively illustrated with over 140 images, the book covers everything from the agricultural makeup of various beers to the technical elements of the brewing process, local effects of brewing on regions around the world, and the social and political implications of sharing a beer. Entries not only define terms such as \"dry hopping\" and \"cask conditioning\" but give fascinating details about how these and other techniques affect a beer's taste, texture, and popularity. Cultural entries shed light on such topics as pub games, food pairings and the development of beer styles. Readers will enjoy vivid accounts of how our drinking traditions have changed throughout history, and how these traditions vary in different parts of the world, from Japan to Mexico, New Zealand, and Brazil, among many other countries. The pioneers of beer-making are the subjects of biographical entries, and the legacies these pioneers have left behind, in the form of the world's most popular beers and breweries, are recurrent themes throughout the book."

      "label": "RDA Planner is used to calculate the nutritional value of the foods you eat. This can be compared to the Recommended Daily Allowances to see if you are getting the nutrition you need. The app is divided into 4 main topics:\n\nDAILY - Keep track of the foods you eat each day. Tap Add Food to add a food to your daily total. This can be an individual food item or a meal that you have created that contains multiple food items.  The best way to add a food is by searching since there are over 5000 different foods you can add. They are also separated by categories if that is easier for you to choose from. Once a food is selected, choose the portion size. Add a cost to the food to see how much you spend and compare by measuring the cost per calorie for each day. Delete a food from your daily total by swiping left on the food item. To get a bigger picture of your daily foods, tap Planner. The planner shows your daily totals for each month. Tap a day to jump to that days totals, or long press on a day to delete all of the foods associated with it. To view more of the vitamins and nutrients consumed on a given day, tap \"View All\". This will show over 30 nutrients and how much you have consumed and compare to the recommended daily allowance. Tap a nutrient to see foods that contain it in high or low values. Also by tapping Info, a detailed description of that nutrient can be found.\n\nMEALS - You can combine multiple food items to make a meal. This will make it easier to add foods that you eat regularly. For example, if you commonly eat yogurt, granola, and juice for breakfast, you can create a meal with a name of your choosing that combines these individual food items. That way you can just add that meal instead of having to add each individual food item every time. Like when you add foods, you can include a cost for the meal. Once a meal is created, you can view its nutrient values the same way as you view them in your daily totals.\n\nFOODS - A list of over 5000 foods and their nutrient values that are separated  by category and can also be searched by name. By selecting a food and choosing its portion size, you can view all of the nutrients is offers. Adding a new food is as simple as entering the nutrient values right from the nutrition label.\n\nRDA - The Recommended Daily Allowance of some nutrients are given based on a 2000 calorie diet. The values in this section is used throughout the app to compare how you are doing meeting your nutritional need. Since the RDA is different for people based on their age, gender, or dietary need, the values can be changed. You may be following a diet where you want different values for Calories, Fat, Carbohydrates, or any other nutrient. To go back to the default values, just tap Reset.\n\nNo Ads! \nNo in-App Purchases!"

      "label": "Sugar is in everything these days, from boxed cereals to pasta sauces; it's almost impossible to avoid unless you're eating a real food diet. The 7 Day Sugar-Free Detox was designed by the Young and Raw team of expert nutritionists and holistic health coaches to create a fun and cleansing experience for you while you break free from the chains of sugar. \n\nStudies show sugar can be highly addictive, so rest assured we've got your back when it comes to kicking it for good! Inside this detox, you're going to find two meal plans to choose from. Our Low-Sugar Plan has small amounts of natural sugar found in fruits. Our No-Sugar Plan is completely sugar free.\n\nRefined or processed sugar is incomplete in its nutrient profile, lacking minerals and vitamins required by our bodies for digestion. What ends up happening when we eat sugar, is our bodies have to seek out the proper minerals required for digestion and unfortunately, those minerals are \"borrowed\" from our mineral reserves. This can lead to mineral deficiency and other health issues that are today, considered \"modern diseases\". \n\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox is designed to support:\n- Breaking sugar addiction\n- Weight loss\n- Liver & Kidney detox\n- Skin health \n- Balancing blood sugar \n- Mood balancing\n- Energy levels\n- Adrenal fatigue\n\nInside the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox you will find:\n- Low-Sugar Meal Plan which includes some fruit sugars\n- No-Sugar Meal Plan which is 100% sugar free\n- Recipes - along with a list of health benefits for each recipe\n- Shopping lists - to make shopping quick and easy, you can tick off items from the list\n- Morning and evening routines - including how to get a perfect night of sleep\n- Young and Raw's favorite books, quotes & documentaries\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the plan work to reset the body?\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox was carefully crafted by experts to get you results while maintaining your sanity throughout the process! \n\nBy replacing sugar with fresh leafy greens, vegetables, seaweeds and seeds along with an abundance of healthy fats, your body will be less hungry for sugar. In the beginning, you may notice a withdrawal period as your body adjusts to running off of fat and real food rather than sugar and carbohydrates. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, it's not easy, but we know you can do it!\n\nThe meal plans have everything you need to detox, and because there are no added or refined sugars your liver and kidneys will get a much needed break from processed sugar.\n\nFor 7 days you're going to experience what it's like to enjoy only real, whole foods but don't forget that diet is only one part of the equation. Proper detox also includes getting enough fresh clean water and optimizing your sleep. Our sleep cycles ensure the body gets its time to effectively detox, renew and heal. The included sleep protocol was designed based on all of the information we have about the importance of optimized sleep and the experiments we have done, to create a protocol that really works. \n\nYour herbal protocol is always optional and if you're on any medications, pregnant or have a health condition, it's advised that you speak with your physician and consult an herbalist prior to taking new supplements. The herbal protocol is minimal yet powerful, including some of the most elite herbs for detoxing the liver, kidneys, creating clear skin and boosting energy in the process. \n\nIn Summary, the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox helps to reset the body by:\n- Gently cleansing the body and promoting toxin elimination\n- Gently introducing blood cleansing foods\n- Providing the body with enough healthy fats to begin removing a reliance upon sugar and processed carbohydrates\n- Encouraging a healthy sleep cycle \n- Creates a movement routine to stimulate the lymphatic system, the endocrine system and the detox organs\n- Hydrating effectively to flush the body of excess toxins and create electrolyte balance"

You use a simple interface to plan out meals like “Hamburgers on Thursday, Fish and Rice on Friday”. Recent meals are easily available or you can type in new items the first time you use them.\n\nMealPlan is a universal app, and will sync between your iPhone and iPad using either iCloud or Dropbox. Plan your meals on the iPad's big screen, and automatically have your grocery list with you on your phone. And access your grocery list from your Apple Watch.\n\nMealPlan creates your grocery list as you're planning meals. When you're done, tap the Grocery Basket to see the list, add new items, mark off items you already have, and then print it, email it, or sync it with your iPhone. This is a huge time saver!\n\nAnd, on the iPad, once you’ve used the app for a few weeks, the Magic Wand will help you quickly fill out subsequent weeks, with a quick suggestions interface.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Simple interface to plan out meals.\n- Keep track of recipes and the groceries they use.\n- Automatically generated grocery list based on your meal plan.\n- Save grocery lists for later use (think \"Party\" or \"Camping\").\n- Save a week's planned meals as a template to reuse.\n- Combined search/add box makes it easy to add new items.\n- Print out a week's plan to any AirPrint printer.\n- Configure your own meals: Add snacks, or remove breakfast if you don't want to plan it.\n- Email a plain text summary of the week's plan.\n- Add a note to any meal item, including clickable links.\n- Dropbox sync for families with multiple devices and accounts.\n- Use Siri for groceries: \"Add Milk to my Grocery List\".\n\n\"Before MealPlan, I’d buy food at the grocery store and then forget I had it .. a few days later it would go to waste. A few minutes every week standing in front of the fridge with MealPlan in hand will help you get the most out of what you have on hand. Plan it, print it out and stick it to your fridge!\"\n\nVisit the website for more information, and a detailed walkthrough of what MealPlan can do."

Baby-led weaning places the emphasis on exploring taste, texture, color and smells as the baby sets their own pace for the meal, and chooses which foods to concentrate on. Instead of spooning food into your baby's mouth, you present him or her with varied finger foods from which to choose and he or she chooses what to eat and how much. If she doesn't touch the oatmeal balls you made for her you do not put them in her mouth, you just offer them to her again at another meal."

The meals include a selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack ideas, with nourishing, enjoyable uses of fruit and vegetables.\n\nWhy I created this app:\n\nEvery toddler goes through phases, particularly when it comes to food. Fussy eaters are notoriously difficult to cater for, especially when it comes to fruit and vegetables.\n\nMy daughter Annabelle has been through her fair share of fussy phases and, at times, still does. This app is my extension from the Baby-Led Weaning recipes I created in the early days of our food-journey; it builds on these by putting health, variety and excitement at the heart of each recipe to keep my fussy eater, and yours, interested by every meal.\n\nI know that when you’re a busy parent or carer, time spent working in the kitchen can seem like the last thing you want to do. That’s why I have created easy-to-prepare, delicious recipes that even the fussiest of eaters should devour in no time! How do I know? Because my own fussy eater, Annabelle, has taste-tested each of these recipes for you.\n\nIf you’re struggling to provide your child with healthy meals, then this app will provide you with tasty recipes to do so, whilst ensuring that they eat a varied balanced diet.\n\nKey App Features:\n\n* Over 110 delicious family recipes designed specifically for fussy eaters\n* A clean, bright design that is easy to navigate\n* Recipes divided into clear breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack sections\n* Search for your favourite family recipes by recipe name and ingredient\n* Add recipe ingredients directly into your shopping basket\n* Save your favourites so they are easily located in one place\n* Free help and support via the online support group (linked in the app)\n* Free app updates and improvements\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have a question or require any support; I am always happy to help.\n\nNatalie x"

      "label": "MealTime is an iOS app that helps you to easily prepare complex meals made up of many different items.\n\nBuild up the meals you want to cook out of items and the different cooking steps that describe how those items are actually cooked. Once added MealTime will then arrange all the different cooking steps to ensure that your meal will have all the items finish cooking together at the same time. \n\nAs the meal is being cooked your phone will tell you when you must start to cook each item, it’ll even warn you so you can be prepared ahead of time. If you fall behind with these instructions then you can simply pause the meal to let you catch up and then resume cooking when you’re ready. Don’t take too long though as items already cooking may overcook, MealTime will warn you of items that will be overcooked whenever you pause the meal.\n\nFor hands free operation you can make MealTime say the cooking instructions out loud so that you can concentrate on cooking your meals.\n\nMealTime will automatically time share your microwave oven if you’re cooking more than one microwave item in your meal. If you’re using an oven to cook any item then it can automatically tell you to preheat your oven just in time for the first oven item to start cooking.\n\nScan barcodes for items you add and you’ll be able to quickly add them to new meals in the future by just scanning their barcode.\n\nYou can visualise the cooking steps in a timeline by rotating your phone onto its side whilst you’re cooking a meal.\n\nIts easy to setup a meal to start or end cooking at a specific time, MealTime will then move all of its notifications to fit the time you request.\n\nBeyond the managed meals, MealTime also includes simple timers, that you can create with 5 second precision instead of the 1 minute precision of the iOS clock timer. You can also start, stop and pause as many of these timers at once as you’d like.\n\nMicrowave wattage adjustments let you calculate the cooking time for an item specified in a certain wattage that’s correct given your microwave’s own wattage, so if an item tells you to cook for 2 minutes in a 750 watt oven then MealTime can tell you that you'll need to cook that item for 1 minute and 30 seconds in a 1000 watt oven.\n\nMealTime includes an iOS Today Widget and Apple Watch App and Complication which lets you glance at the progress of mealtime without having to open the app.\n\nMealTime has been developed with a real focus on VoiceOver support for vision impaired users to enable them to use all the apps features with ease."

There are some dog friendly maps for other parts of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, since I live in Edinburgh and I rely on member recommendations for any listings further afield, the app's coverage outside of Scotland is limited. The database however is constantly growing but as you can imagine there’s only so many pubs and cafes I can get to! \n\nRhian\n\n********************************\n\nOn the app there is an extensive Edinburgh & Lothians section including a visitor guide and separate interactive maps for pubs, cafes and shops with nearest location functionality. The Edinburgh section has 400+ dog friendly listings split by area and various categories. \n\nThe Glasgow section is also extensive with nearly 200 listings and an interactive pub map as well as an interactive cafe map. Both of these have nearest location functionality. You can also browse individual Glasgow listings by area or category.\n\nOther areas covered in Scotland include The Highlands, Aberdeenshire, Argyll & Bute, Ayrshire, Dundee, Fife, Stirlingshire, Dumfries & Galloway, Loch Lomond, Perthshire, The Scottish Borders, Renfrewshire, Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire. However, as mentioned above the coverage in these areas may be limited. Please get in touch before downloading if you need further info on coverage in Scotland. \n\n***There are also interactive dog friendly maps for parts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, at this time, this app's coverage in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is limited and not all towns and cities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are covered. If you live in either England, Wales and Northern Ireland and are looking for an app to help you find dog friendly places in your local area, then please do NOT download this app as it will not provide enough coverage for you. Please feel free to get in touch via email if you would like to help expand your local area's coverage. \n\nOf course, if you live in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and will be visiting Scotland on holiday with your dog then you will likely find this app useful. If unsure however, please get in touch first before downloading. \n\nThe information for England, Wales and Northern Ireland has been provided mainly to help out Scottish users who may be visiting England, Wales and Northern Ireland on holiday with their dog. Therefore the listings in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are mostly found in major cities or tourist areas and only provide a limited number based mostly on members recommendations while traveling outwith Scotland with their dog (rather than from local knowledge). \n\nOther Features:\n* Favourites functionality is available for all listing sections. \n* Pet Travel Section\n* Photo Gallery\n* Offline Support for a selection of pages / listings\n\nPlease note that this is a standalone app. However, if you have a Dugs n' Pubs Big Dug login, you can access additional features on the app including \"My Location\". However, you do not need a login to use the app.\n\nPlease email via the feedback form on the app for feature requests. \n\nIf you encounter an issue with the app or find that it is not meeting your needs, please do get in touch in the first instance prior to leaving a review as I will try to help you out as much as I can."

Healthy can (and should) taste good… and become an enjoyable part of your lifestyle. Today, Jen shares that passion as creator of Simple Green Smoothies."
